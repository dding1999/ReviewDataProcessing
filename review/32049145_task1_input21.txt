$REVIEW.: its a journey into the prison of indiana penal farm which is a medium security prison full of clans and gangs and all the players who pull the strings. One hundred inmates hold 12 guards hostage and one solitary man , a dorm counselor is the go between to negotiate a truce, but is let down by the privatisation services who runs the prison, who have cut commodities upon the inmates and so it begins. Its a very intense indepth book to read, most enjoyable and if you have a loved on who is an inmate you should read this book. Its most enlightening, touches the heart, you may have to do the time if you commit the crime but after all they are human beings as well.

I learned a great deal about what I believe, why I believe it and what I need to weed out of my thoughts.I would reccommend this as an entertaining read or as a study


Read it twice and try it both ways.My eyes were opened to ideas I've been carrying around without question that may not have been healthly

Such as, thinking their weren't very many women in the Bible

Boy was I off in my thinking.Inspired by this book I'm rereading the Bible with new eyes.Great read.

$REVIEW.: This is the final book in the series and I was hooked from the get go however, I did contemplate stopping briefly to take a cold shower at the beginning but decided to forego that idea because like with the previous book I couldn&#8217;t put it down. This book introduced a few new characters into the crew mainly Colin&#8217;s Great Grandmother Helga, who happens to disappear during the birthday party they are all attending and that&#8217;s when the excitement and craziness begins. We get to meet up with Natalie&#8217;s girls again who together crack me up. There are trust issues and other relationship problems that come up and it&#8217;s great to see the characters have to decide whether to let them go or let everything go. This was the perfect ending to this series and I completely enjoyed being part of this crazy and unexpected world. I definitely would recommend the series to anyone that likes feisty characters, steamy sex scenes, and random craziness.

$review_text.: Near Selsey, Jo Stevens saw what she thought was a beached dolphin amongst the trash that came ashore on the beach.  However, she got closer and realized she found a half naked woman dead amidst the seaweed and garbage.  Chichester CID Inspector Henrietta "Hen" Mallin and her team lead the official inquiry starting with who she is and whether her death was an accident or a homicide.However, before the cops can dig into the case, Jo finds a second corpse eerily similar to the first one she reported.  This time she fears telling the cops because the coincidence is too weird and she would become the prime suspect of two murders.  She fails to inform the police.  When the body is reported, Hen and her subordinates focus on Stevens and even more on her boyfriend who knew both victims.THE HEADHUNTERS is a unique English police procedural as the storyline rotates points of view between the inspector and the corpse finder; especially fascinating is reading the logical rationalization of Jo when she fails to report the second dead body to the authorities.  Fans will appreciate this diamond of a tale as Hen and her CID team works on solving the two homicides while also seeking her first investigation (see THE CIRCLE).Harriet Klausner

$REVIEW.: There is nothing new here, save your money. This "book" is shorter than some emails I've written. There are no complete examples, no diagrams, and it's full of spelling and grammar mistakes. You can literally find 100x more content with better, clearer explanations on a free site like mnemotechnics.org (n.b. I am not affiliated in any way with that site).The author briefly discusses the Method of Loci. His secret sauce includes adding movement to visualizations (not new), and creating a story from using the Link Method (also not new).If you're serious about training your memory, check out tried-and-true classic: The Memory Book by Harry Lorayne.

$REVIEW.: First, I have downloaded numerous recipe books on Kindle and for the most part, they are awful. Awful formatting, no clickable TOC so I can jump to the recipe I want. This book is different in that respect. The formatting is excellent and the TOC is clickable so that you can jump right to the recipe you're looking for. Each recipe also has an intro to each cookie, which I enjoyed.As far as the recipes go, they are truly wonderful! There are great recipes for your favorites (chocolate chip, gingerbread, etc) and your soon-to-be new favorites like coffee cookies, cherry chocolate, crumbly cookies, toffee apple cookies and more. Seriously, if you live in the U.S., you probably haven't heard of most of the cookies in this book. A couple of them sounded completely bizarre but as it turned out, these "bizarre" sounding cookies had all our friends talking. We have at least a dozen cookbooks solely for cookies and this one can't be beat. If you're looking for something to make that is unique and a guaranteed party favorite that will have people talking, get this book and try the interesting selection of cookies.

$review_text.: You Will Never Work Again is full of principals that are easily understood and made even easier by diagrams charts and pictures. You can tell that this book was written with a fair amount of research as a lot of the sources cited I have read or hear an audio book. I believe that a great amount of time was invested in making this book what it is a great book for anyone with a dream to be something more for themselves and for others. I don't know but many eye opening thoughts many that have briefly crossed my mind from time to time such as the amount of time we all have living. And for many it is something dramatic that needs to happen like in this story as described. You can tell the writer has indeed had a lot of experience as well as trials and tribulations to get to the point where he is now which has been his goal finally achieved but not without a little schooling at hard knocks university it was good to read this book it let me know that in many ways I am on the right path in my life right now but also has added some things I am willing to try to get there a bit more easily. I would say the only issue with this books is the italics at times makes it look as if the author is lacking a space but this is simply due to the font and a slight hint of self promotion which is very minimal considering all of the other works he is promoting as well. So in being a little critical about what I read but not obsessive about it I would say a fair judgement would be about a 4.7 out of 5.0 if you are looking for a more exact rating it really was a very good book and it covers not only stuff from the author but a lot of the things the author has researched and read along the way that helped him which to me is giving credit to others as well for his success a very nice thing to see.

The book offers plenty of helpful tricks when it comes to resume, interview and so much more. He offers a different approach. I believe his techniques are effective and can be a real life changer.While reading this book, I learned about myself and what I should be looking for. Paul knows what he is talking about and this book proves it. I think all readers benefit from his life's anecdotes and advice.

I've spent plenty of time, money, and energy on similar products that left me jaded and still feeling like there was a missing piece to the puzzle.I'm happy to say John Locke fit every piece of the puzzle into place.I read this book from beginning to end in less than three hours


I could not pull myself from the page until I was done

This is full of amazing detail of how he reached success as a self-published author


One particular detail about blogging was so simple I smiled to myself as I read it and thought, 'Now why didn't I already think of that?!'This is brilliant

I really love Locke writing voice

$review_text.: This is a remarkable novel about the abandonment of an Italian wife by her cad of a husband. The translation reads so smoothly that the reader would not be aware that the book originated in Italy. A quick read at less than 200 pages, "The Days Of Abandonment" is for anyone who suffers an unexpected rejection from a long-time lover or spouse.The novel is accurate in tracing the major depression that Olga undergoes and comes through with agonizing pain and not always with grace. But she does come through it. The universality of abandonment is the same whether the reader is in Italy or America or anywhere else.

$review_text.: First, all these Soho mystery paperbacks are excellent,including the book design! Murder in the Sentier belongs among the top European mysteries, and C. Black's series is right up there with Simenon's Maigret, from decades back. Higher praise does not exist! Our odd and flamboyant German/French late 20's Detective/Computer Expert Heroine meets a shady lady, who may have some secrets about our heroine's mother, and any part she played in a near defunct 1970's Terrorist group. Unfortunately, the shady lady is shot dead while waiting to meet Aimee at a Paris Cemetary. The rest is a fine whodunnit, plus very fine scenes in the Sentier neighborhood, along with a motley crew of  Parisians of many sorts, from Bourse traders, Coffee House Turks, and Street People of all sorts. Stylistically, this is way above many competitors in the Euro-Mystery field, and really a pleasure to read thruout! One of the final scenes may have been a bit predictable to an old mystery hand, but still done with real polish and flair throughout! In fact, this is one of the few mysteries good enough to merit a re-reading, which I might do soon!

I absolutely loved Ben aka Dr. Yummy. Reminding me of a sexy character from Grey's Anatomy, Ben is everything you're looking for in a leading man: Smart and sexy. Collins writes in such a way that makes you feel Kayley's agony of being a widow and her uphill battle to rise from the despair. Living Again is definitely worth checking out.

$review_text.: Please be advised: If you did not read Emerge, book 1 in the Evolve Series, this review may contain spoilers for you.Embrace knocked my socks off! I loved Emerge so much and I couldn't wait for book two in the series to come out and now that I have read it, I still want more

This book is full of such a dynamic group all with varying personalities and attitudes, but in the end they each have one important thing in common, they have each other's backs, and I love it!Laney and Evan grew up the best of friends and had just begun to dabble in the relationship side of things, but when they went off to college something happened


Laney met Dane

Everything changed
And in a big way when Evan showed up at the end of Emerge with his letter of transfer, knowing that Laney and him were finally going to be together
But Laney ultimately followed her heart and stayed with Dane.Evan, heartbroken and feeling lost, has to now figure out how to live again

Can he accept Laney's apology? Can he move beyond the hurt inside? Can they salvage a friendship with Laney and what happens when Whitley enters the picture again, but this time looking at Evan and not Dane?It was no secret that Whitley was not a favorite of Laney in the first book, but reality was that she was just so misunderstood

It seems the only person that could see this was Evan

Evan and Whitley formed a tight bond almost instantly

They became fast friends and Evan loved spending time with her, but he knew he would never change her from a friend into a relationship, EVER

Nothing good ever becomes of that..
his only evidence of this was how things ended between him and Laney.Meanwhile, Laney discovered that she didn't really have a stalker all those years and in fact her mother was only a couple of hours away
But can she find the courage to mail the letter she wrote to her or could she be even braver and go and visit?We spend some time in Dane's past as well
Things he knows he has to deal with but is too afraid for Laney to find out about

If she finds out, she will certainly leave him
But what happens is anything but what you would expect.I still have not gotten my fill of these characters


I still love Laney and I still think her sass is awesome, but I have this new found appreciation for Whitley
The one scene where she goes all out just threw me over the edge

I could see standing there and I am sure the look on my face would have matched that of her friends
Priceless! Evan grew on me again in this book and I realized that yup, I was team Dane, but I was also team Evan! I loved them both and by the end of this book, I wanted to climb in and hang out in the mud with all of them.I wanted to play on the farm with the piggies and I wanted to hang out and laugh with this group

They are my favorite fictional friends and I cannot seem to get enough of them

S.E
Hall did such an amazing job with Emerge and outdid herself with Embrace


I cannot wait to see what she comes up with next!*I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review*

$REVIEW.: Jackson has done it again with her writing talent. &quot;Never to Late for Love&quot; was very moving.  It is a book about middle age adults falling in love in spite if all the obstacles that were put in there way.  Again Jackson talks about an issue that not common in the romance novel arena, Alcoholism. One last thought, I found Tiffany's son to be very weak individual, I wonder what's going to happen to him! Nice read!

$review_text.: Fourty-two poets read their own work on three CDs. The accompanying text is a large and rather weighty book with a chapter for each of the poets. Each chapter includes a one-page biography, a two or three page essay on the works, and several representative poems including those read on the CD. Poetry fans of all stripe will be fascinated by the readings, which range from early (and difficult to understand) recordings by Lord Tennyson to fairly recent (and good quality) recordings by Sylvia Plath. Some of the recordings are quite rare and hard to find; others have been widely available for many years.The great interest in this collection, of course, is the opportunity to actually hear a great poet--and possibly one of your own favorites--read their own work. And the result can be disconcerting, magical, and sometimes both. The earlier poets found in the collection do not read their poems so much for content as they do for rhyme, giving the rythms of their work emphasis above all else; later poets, however, are prone to read very dramatically, sometimes to the exclusion of all else. And there are a number of suprises. Carl Sandburg reads with a significant accent and such a lilt that he often sounds as if he is about to flow into song. Gertrude Stein and Dorothy Parker, two poets as different as night and day, have unexpectedly rich and warm voices. e.e. cummings reads very, very slowly--almost to a point at which you'd like to shake him by the shoulders and ask him to speed it up! Interestingly, it becomes increasingly obvious to the listener that a poet is not necessarily the best reader of his own work, for some are clearly more successful readers than others.The recordings, be they good or bad, are always interesting. The same cannot be said for the text. The short biographies of each poet are reasonable, but the essays concerning their works are a very mixed lot. Some are quite interesting, addressing elements in both the poetry and the poet's reading of it; a few are so completely spurious that one wonders why the editors bother to include them at all. (I also find it a bit frustrating that two personal favorites--Marianne Moore and Stevie Smith--are not included in the collection, but this of course is a matter of personal taste.) In spite of the very occasional short-comings in the text, POETRY SPEAKS would be an ideal purchase for both budding and lifelong poetry lovers. It would also be ideal for the English teachers, literature professors, and librarians in your life.Since none of the editorial reviews actually include the poets found in this collection, I note them here: Lord Tennyson; Robert Browning; Walt Whitman; William Butler Yeats; Gertrude Stein; Robert Frost; Carl Sandburg; Wallace Stevens; William Carlos Williams; Ezra Pound; H.D.; Robinson Jeffers; John Crowe Ransom; T.S. Eliot; Edna St. Vincent Millay; Dorothy Parker; e.e. cummings; Louise Bogan; Melvin B. Tolson; Laura Riding Jackson; Langston Hughes; Ogden Nash; W.H. Auden; Louis MacNeice; Theodore Roethke; Elizabeth Bishop; Robert Hayden; Muriel Rukeyser; William Stafford; Randall Jarrell; John Berryman; Dylan Thomas; Robert Lowell; Gwendolyn Brooks; Robert Duncan; Philip Larkin; Denise Levertov; Allen Ginsberg; Frank O'Hara; Anne Sexton; Etheridge Knight; and Sylvia Plath.

$REVIEW.: I received a copy of "Shadowed Threads, A Rylee Adamson Novel #4" as an ARC in exchange for an honest review.  This book should be read in order of the series as so many things would be difficult to get without knowledge of the previous books.  As usual I absolutely love Alex the werewolf!  There is something just so fun about this guy :)The story takes up where we left off with Rylee trying to get information from Jack and trying to get moving with her other projects.  So many difficulties and challenges to overcome for Rylee and her friends,  I had a few emotional moments during my read as well. There is an intro of new supernaturals and plot lines. Can't wait to see what happens next!  Fun read and a great series overall.

$review_text.: This is the follow up story to Wicked Games. They can both be read as stand alone books. We get small glimpses of our hero and heroine from the last book in this one as well.Katy Short just wants to help her brother Brodie shoot to stardom. She's giving up her time to promote Brodie for the reality game show Endurance Island. But they are no longer casting for that show. But they are quite interested in the siblings for their newest show, The World Races (similar to The Amazing Race).So as reluctant teammates they set off on an around the world race for a big payday and hopefully stardom for her brother. Even if they lose, they still get enough money to help Katy with her new business.Katy and Brodie win the first leg of the race, they also win an advantage in the game. They have the option to, at some point in the race save one team from elimination. Brodie chooses to use it right away to save the last place team. The famous rock star Tesla Spooner and her lead guitarist. What Brodie doesn't know is that along with saving them, now they are required to switch partners as well. Now Katy is stuck with the tattooed, pierced gloomy guy who pushed her in the opening of the race. Liam Brogan.This was a fun story. Lots of similarity to the Amazing Race, but still a cute love story. We also see Dean and Abby from the first book and they end up helping Katy and Liam along the way.

$review_text.: Eisenman's New Testament Code is the latest chapter in his exegesis of the life of James, alleged brother to Jesus
As such, he continues his earlier themes, finding support for all kinds of thrilling and romantic stories about Temple politics in early Palestine.I'll briefly summarize his argument, and save you the time and expense of this ponderous, erudite read
Eisenman believes that James was the leader of an early Christian sect that prized piety, bathing, celibacy, and vegetarianism
They were radically xenophobic, hating all things Roman, and anyone who collaborated with the Romans
As the surviving leader (or originator) of Christianity, James preached suffering and damnation for all who collaborated with Rome
So far, Eisenman is on semi-historical ground, as modern Arab Christian sects can corroborate parts of this story.Eisenman goes much further, though
In his view, James held secret prayer ceremonies in the Temple, apart from the "official" (and hence, unclean or contaminated) ones run by the collaborators


This brought him into conflict with the authorities


However, they could not easily dispose of James, as the people loved "The Just." James was eventually charged with blasphemy for his secret prayer services, as cover for his agitation against the collaborators

Eisenman won't say it out loud, but it's clear that he believes the whole execution for blasphemy is in fact a story about James, later attributed to Jesus.Before his death, James came into conflict with Paul, a collaborator with Rome
To Eisenman, Paul is a con man; one who seeks power
When the collaborators were in power, Paul sought to stay in power


After the Jewish revolt, he "converted" to James' (now more popular) school, to escape punishment and find shelter in his wanderings

Paul may even have directly assaulted James at several points, or caused James' murder.Thus, to Eisenman, the whole of the Pauline new testament is basically a sham, invented by Paul after the fact to cover his tracks


A few works, such as the letter from James, are authentic.Eisenman finds his evidence in the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Pseudo Clementine literature, and other records


He has to go to great lengths to disparage the consensus dates for the scrolls, though

The primary literature supports part of this case, but not all


Unfortunately, the book has no endnotes; they are all online


In my opinion, that makes this already difficult book less scholarly.Reading this book is like walking in circles
He has lots of analysis of the imagery used in the scrolls, and tries to piece together the "true" history of the early church from fragments and "educated" guesses


Here is where he lost my support
The writing his difficult to read, Eisenman never states his case concretely, and it's hard to see why I should value his reconstruction of James and Paul as authoritative, compared to all the other attempts.Not much is new in this book


That James is more certain as a historical figure than Jesus is well known


That the radical, anti-Roman sects lived and preached apocalypse is also well known

The book sheds light on the politics of radical versus collaborator, but most of it seems fanciful.If you're a mythicist as far as Jesus goes, the book will have some insights and provide some good references (authors, not bibliography, that too is online)
His case against conventional dates of the scrolls is really the only new thing, since his earlier book James, the brother of Jesus
That argument, too, is interested and gets some support, but he should work it out at greater length.Don't bother with this book
If you want some ideas as to the content of Christian mythology, look into the writings of Margaret Barker, instead.

$REVIEW.: This book caught my eye.  As someone very interested in the history of the region, the intersection of history, politics, and a crime novel involving a current leader of Hamas and the now once-again Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, struck me as something both fascinating and relevant.  In some respects it was both.  But, I couldn't get by the one-sided depiction of a terrorist movement and the complete and utter minimization of its murderous methodology.Biographers often fall in love with their subjects, but Khalil Mishal is not such a loveable man.  This man is a brutal terrorist, who stands for principles such as Islamic extremism, murder, and anti-Semitism.  Yet, to read this book, you'd think he was just a driven man running a valid political movement, distant from the distasteful (though not presented as horrifying) acts committed by his cohorts.  Israel may have been wrong to try to kill him, but not because he deserved mercy, but because the plan was deeply flawed, a conclusion that Paul McGeogh undoubedly agrees with.The book is painfully one sided, presenting Israel in as dark a light as possible and Hamas in as bright one.  McGeogh doesn't even have the integrity to admit his bias.  He describes the development of the Palestinian issue by reference to Israeli historian Ilan Pappe.  Clearly the author knows that this viewpoint is not a mainstream opinion and that Mr. Pappe is the author of anti-Israel diatribes such as the sensationally misnamed "Ethnic cleansing of Palestine".  Page 107 details a Hamas suicide attack that wasn't particularly bad because "most of the wounds were slight; none was life threatening" and then contrasts it to the 1994 rampage of Israeli settler, Baruch Goldstein, who attacked without organizational support.  But the worst calumny on that page is the statement following that "[d]uring the protests that followed, Israeli troops would kill another dozen", implying that the Israeli troops are moral collaborators in mass murder with Mr. Goldstein.  This is but one example of the continual trend to minimize Hamas atrocity and demonize Israel.McGeogh knows how to write, so the book does run smoothly.  Its that ability to convey subtle political commentary that makes the book disquieting.  This book is more than a description of a botched assassination in Amman, but a justification for Hamas and a celebration of its ability to frustrate the West and its agents.  In its presentation, it is one sided, ignores any refrence to the Jewish narrative, and presents the Boim and Holy Land Foundation litigation in a false light (though, in its defense it may have been completed before major developments in that regard).If you can read between the lines, there's a lot of information here.  If you can't, there is a lot of disinformation here.  The story itself is fascinating.  I just wish it was presented objectively.

Loved Fudge, he told Micah like it was and didn't hold back..The ending seemed rushed, and I wish it could have had a couple more chapters, SPOILER ALERT..Maddie ended things, both were miserable for a couple days and then the awards they are back together end of book... at least an epilogue would have been nice OR a continuing book :)

$review_text.: This review is for the kindle edition only

Unfortunately it will also appear along with reviews for the physical book, which is something I have no control over.While the stories in this volume are good (not nearly as good as stories in the later volumes, though), the digital formatting is just terrible


It's painful to even describe some of the problems encountered

The editors chose to use footnotes instead of end notes, so the footnotes float around anywhere and everywhere, instead of at the bottom of the page as they would be in the physical book (or at the end of each individual pastiche, where they would be if formatted properly for the kindle)


There are bizarre blank lines in the middle of paragraphs, and strange numbers appearing out of nowhere
Some pages (kindle screens) have only a few lines of type on them, with an illustration appearing on the next page --and more than once, the caption for the illustration appears on yet a third page


(In a physical book this would properly be a couple of lines of type and the illustration with its caption all appearing on the same page.) The fancy large letter that starts each story appears on a line all by itself, with the rest of the word and the rest of the sentence on another line entirely.This series has been slowly digitizing the earliest volumes whereas the later volumes came out with kindle versions right away


The later volumes (that is to say, volumes that were written later but digitized sooner) are not victim to any of these problems so I would say the publishers did not want to expend the effort to change anything about this early book in order to make it more compatible with a smooth conversion
It's a shame.Every single story in the kindle version has these annoying issues, so I elected to return the book for my money back, even though I thought the stories were more than passable pastiches
If you know that strange formatting issues will not bother you, give this book a try


Otherwise, give it a pass.

$REVIEW.: Ok... So I was a fan of In the Country of Hearts, and a bit pissed that Tokyo pop closed, but when I heard about In The Countey of Clover, I was expecting it to be similar. Visually it was similar, but It followed the storyline of Alice falling I love with Dee and Dum. Then at the end there were brief one shots of her falling for Vivaldi, Blood, the Cheshire Cat Boris and Gowan.... Even when I found out it was based on a video game I still didn't follow as to why Alice was so in love with each at the end. I know how dating games work, but since this is a manga series I'm not sure there will be a cohesive plot line.Boris will get  three or four volumes and then there's 'my Fanatic Rabbit' being released later.  So I'm guessing each manga (or set of volumes) will be about a different plot line and love interest for Alice.If this is what you are looking for, or if you love the dating game then I recommend this.Plot: Alice and the Hatters' mansion has moved into the Country of Clover. Dee and Dum show Alice that they have the ability to grow or shrink their bodies, they still call her Big Sis.  They are not blood related but if any form or hint of sibling love bothers you just be aware.  The actual plot takes a back seat to their growing love, there's an assembly but we aren't sure what's going on or what's being decided because we are reading about Alice blushing or thinking about the twins.  The twins are just as bloody and violent as ever, they kill, they slice and they enjoy it. There are hot kissing scenes and a lot of blushing, but the 16+ age recommendation is mostly for the suggestiveness rather than anything hotter.All in all I will buy the first Waltz of the Cheshire Cat to see if it's better, or just about her falling in love with Boris. Good artwork, good size, and interesting.

These stories take place ad the turn of the 20th century. The early 1900's. These are way too dated for my enjoyment. I was very disappointed.
$SUMMARY.: Not the Tom swift I know

$REVIEW.: Holy crumb! This was... really kind of awesome. The world that unfurls as this story is told is creepy in the extreme. I love creepiness. I LOVE IT. The idea that women aren't responsible enough to manage their own bodies, especially if they're a teen who gets pregnant... chilling.For my inaugural Diana Peterfreund read, I think I picked a good one.-Kelly @ Reading the Paranormal

$review_text.: Sensual Surrender. Serafina: Sin City Series. Katie ReusReview from Jeannie Zelos Book reviews.Once again I&#8217;ve jumped into a series without reading the first book. I've read other novels of Katie's though, and I know she has an easy to follow writing style I enjoy, and found that I had no trouble working out the relationships in this book. I was surprised that what I thought was going to happen did...and then it was over, and we moved forward with the thrust of the story not being what I&#8217;d predicted. That's good though :) I like to be surprised, keeps the reading fresh. Its a romance but not one where the characters have yet to get together, but one where they already live together but need to take that final trust and cement the love between them.Ellie &#8211; what a great character, she's pulled herself up form a dreadful past, and yet there are still events that she's unable to let go. She's done things she's not proud of, but doesn't regret making that choice, its what brought her to where she is. Now though those choices could bring danger to her lover Jay. She can't take that, and does what she thinks is best and leaves....Jay and his family and employers aren't giving in easily though and take steps to trace and protect her.Jay is a lovely man, he's deeply in love with Ellie, and has no idea about her past. He knows she has some secrets but not this &#8211; and he's terrified for her and the danger she faces. With their boss and his wife who regard them as family, his brother and girlfriend they all work closely to support Ellie and see her through the danger.As I said I was surprised &#8211; in a good way &#8211; at how the story went. It is romance, ( hot, sexy, racy romance!) and suspense too, with danger facing Ellie and Jay, and plans to be carefully constructed to catch the protagonists. Along the way Ellie has to learn to face her past, and to trust in Jay, that he'll love her no matter what, and that he'll understand why she hid her past from him.Its a great read, quite short at 150 pages but succinct, and everything dovetails neatly. There's a novel before this one, and more to follow and they'll make a great series. It's priced at 2.05 for 150 pagesStars: Four, fun, light read.ARC supplied by Netgalley

$review_text.: Did you have a favorite blanket when you were little?  Get ready to meet your new one, now that you're older.  This book gave me more pleasure last year when I read it than that much beloved piece of flannel ever did, and I  dragged Nick Hornby's pseudomemoir around with me long after I finished  reading it, in the sense that I tried to FORCE everyone else I knew, even  slightly, to read it.  Why?  Like Rob, the protagonist, I am not exactly  sure about &quot;stuff&quot;. However, at least he is honest, and,  incredibly funny about the mess he is making about his life. In other  words, he is so very, totally, hopelessly HUMAN.I didn't particularly  care about the fact that the author is male and I, the reader, am female.  I think this is not the point of this book.  Rather, this book is about the  struggles we all have, doing our best to face up to our fears, and the  total screw ups we all make just living our lives when we finally take some  sort of a stand about ANYTHING and make a choice.  After all, what could  possibly go wrong?  Ha, ha, ha.Just read the first page and I guarantee  you'll be hooked.  By the time you are finished, you will be touched and  you will want to touch the other people you know by sharing this terrific,  funny, poignant, contempory bestseller with them.Can't wait to see the  movie.  If John Cusack doesn't do right by this, I'll be really surprised.  Even though he is not British, like the author, Nick Hornby, he should be  perfect. He's got the vulnerable yet intelligent maleness that makes you  incapable of not loving High Fidelity's funny, goofy, always trying (well,  kind of) Rob down to a T. Now go rearrange your record collection.best  wishes, Jean

$REVIEW.: I was almost put off by the seemingly religious/mystical nature of the book (because of the title), but after checking out the back cover I decided to give it a read. I'm sure glad that I did! It was one of the most thought-provoking books I've come across in a while!I'm normally not one for mysticism. I tend to believe in what I can see and touch, and that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. This book, however, seemed to be marketed to people just like me as its claims were indeed accompanied by extraordinary evidence of all types. The author used logic, real-world examples, and rational discussion to turn my own logical, rational way of seeing on its head. He explained how consciousness, matter, and time are really just an illusion, or even one in the same and showed me that some things we might consider to be mystical might really just worth more study and research.Some of the arguments about quantum physics, time dilation, and duality were incredibly interesting. I enjoyed not only what I was reading while I was reading it, but the hours worth of contemplation that seemed to stem from the book.My only complaints were that the formatting is a bit odd and there were some pretty obvious spelling and grammar mistakes throughout.TL;DR: Highly stimulating material that will really make you think. I would highly recommend this book to all!

$review_text.: Some of the book is accurate. This book lacks the kind of academic, compelling research I would like to see. I've found that kind of research in &quot;The Case for Marriage&quot;, mixed with advice based on the research.Dr. Jeffers commits the philosophical fallacy of believing that her experience and her friends' and acqaintences' experiences represent universal truths about parenthood. There is very little solid research here on anyone, with an emphasis on anecdotes from the experiences of people who are white, highly educated, and upper middle class. Divorce, for instance, has a very small role in her analysis of why parenting is hard, while we know from research that it plays a major role in parenting satifaction. She, her friends, and acquaintences are bound by similiar geographic and educational experiences that make them similiar. Every good social scientist knows this- that's why we can't make general claims off of one person's experience.Some problems she claims are normal are simply bad parenting. The research is clear that parents do have a very specific influence on children's choices on drugs, sex, education, etc. That she dismisses years of reputable research, especially research based on the National Longitudinal Study data, exposes her as an incompetent researcher. She just doesn't know the survey of research in her field, and from her remarks, probably has no wish to. Had she demolished the motherhood myth with research from her field, her book would have been more compelling.Several things she cites as &quot;pains&quot; of parenthood can be prevented by certain parenting techniques. &quot;Ferbering&quot; can help with the sleep deprivation. Fast, tailored discipline helps with the tantrums. Teenagers who are obnoxious and disrepectful do so becasue they get away with it. When the parents respond with discipline, whether by removing priviledges, destroying the Playstation game, or removing the phone, they behave better. Most teenage behavior is culturally induced. Parents of homeschooled kids who limit contact don't have the same kinds of problems.The book should have addressed the fact that parents don't get support for effective discipline. THe &quot;gurus&quot; she castigates have done most of their damage in the spanking/discipline debate. One of her myths should have been that spanking is always child abuse and ineffective. New research, and better analysis of old research, disproves this. The permissive culture we live in creates the &quot;obnoxious&quot; kids we deal with.Dr. Jeffers is not a researcher. She is in family practice. She does not have juried research published in her field. To be blunt, she's a popular writer. She has very little context to place her own experiences in her practice in. This leads her to see them as universal, when others with different backgrounds do not.Perhaps most disturbing is her assertion that work saves women from the craziness of motherhood. Black women watched this idiotic premise take over the women's movement with the publication of Susan Brownmiller's &quot;Feminity&quot; and Freidan's works. We have always worked, and we have always argued that the problem is not parenthood per se nor the children, but the inflexibility of a society that refuses the acknowledge the needs of children. Just as academic and popular feminism is finally moving to accept this argument, buttresses by research and the long experience of middle class black women's lives, here comes a seventies white feminist to assert the same tired trivia. Working doesn't keep women sane. Balancing work and family, with the help of a community does.The self-indulgence whining of this book resounds among people with serious parenting problems. WHen your children face drive by shootings, drugs, etc, this author simply implys, &quot;Too bad. Shouldn't have had them. We are not going to work to make society safer, or your lives easier.&quot;I devoured academic, not popular, literature when I was pregnant. I don't listen to the popular &quot;gurus&quot;, as Jeffers refers to them. I have found Internet parenting forums, academic books, and articles give better advice for managing parenting than this book does.Dr. Jeffers didn't like parenting, and falsely extrapolates that most people also must not like parenting, and those who do are &quot;hardwired&quot; for it. That's not supported by biology, psychology, or anything else. SOme people learn more effetive paretning techniques, and are better personality fits. When parents are taught a range of effective techniques, from time out, to taking away priviledges to limited spanking, the parents and the children are happier.Instead of arguing that society should value being  &quot;child-free&quot; more, parenting would be easier if society valued PARENTING. Tolerance from people in stores, flexibility in work, and the leashing of selfish people who hate kids and wish to ban them from public would help. Society benefits from the education and creation of children. These things would be better for parents than just telling us, as Jeffers does, that &quot;children are obnoxious, and you have to live with it.&quot;I also object to her characterization of legitimate duties of parents as being optional. Going to sports events are not important, nor is signing kids up for everything. Parent-teacher conferences are important. Cookies for the Scouts are important. She applauds the women who refuse to volunteer. Volunteering lets a person see their child in a group situation, and note social/educational problems. This allows for early intervention. Multiple research sources, most recently (two weeks ago) from the Us Department of the Army schools, shows that when parents volunteer for school or extra-curricular activites that their children are involved in raises the childrens test scores and grades. It proves to the children that their parents see the activity as important, and it gives the parents perspective on their children's sometimes bad behavior.The problem today is not that parents think thier children behave badly. It's that too many refuse to discipline their kids, and think their kids behave well in the face of clear evidence. That's a subject that needs a few more research oreinted books out there about it.

$review_text.: SOPHIA IS AN EROTIC VAMPIRE ROMANCE JUNKIE'S "WET DREAM." LOVED THE STORY'S PLOT, ENERGY, ROMANCE, EROTICA, MYSTERY HUMOR.... BUT RAPHAEL STOLE THE SHOW. IN SOPHIA, RAPHAEL IS DELICIOUSLY VICIOUS EXERTING HIS POWERS IN WAYS THAT IS, IN A WORD, "MIND-BLOWING" PUN INTENDED.Unlike some, I was delighted to find my old friends, Cyn, Raphael and Duncan masterfully interwoven into this tale. I loved Sophia and Colin's story emensely, but alone there story would have only amounted to a "novella" rather than this tantallizingly superb and pleasingly long story. I am a big "sookie stackhouse" novels fans, but I have to say that Ms. Reynolds' Vampires in America series is as good as the fomer if not better.  Keep it coming!! Also, Ms. Reynolds, I greatly appreciate that it does not take forever for each installment in the series to be released WITHOUT SACRIFICING THE QUALITY OF YOU WORK.I am anxiously awaiting the release of "Duncan" and althought I can never get encough of Cyn and Raphael, I do hope that the story will focus primarily upon Duncan and his story.  Frankly, however,I find it unrealistic to phantom that Duncan's story can be sufficiently rendered without weaving in Raphael, and thus Cyn, BUT this Reader won't mind one bit if Raphael, Cyn and Duncan are always included in every book comprising the Vampires in America Series. I would even like to see Raj again, could do without Sarah though!:)SOPHIA AS WELL AS THE ENTIRE VAMPIRES IN AMERICA IS A MUST READ SO DON'T HESTITATE! ENJOY!

$review_text.: This deeply compelling, raw, and insightful story of Connie Almony's, inserts the reader into Cole Harrison&#8217;s intensely troubled life&#8230; A life that&#8217;s filled with self-loathing, self-absorption, and alcohol abuse. Cole Harrison was only half a man. Ugly on the outside, and ugly on the inside. At least, that is what he thought of himself. A war veteran amputee that suffers from PTSD, he frequently has visions and nightmares of the worse kind, carries an ever-present peace-consuming guilt, and exudes a surliness that he uses along with his disfigurements to keep everyone at a distance.Cole makes a somewhat hesitant agreement with a man he recently comes across, to try out and potentially invest in the prototype prosthetic's that this man&#8217;s daughter Carly Rose has developed. Carly, upon Cole&#8217;s insistence, moves into his mansion and life to help train Cole with his new limbs. But Carly soon realizes that Cole&#8217;s brokenness isn't just physical and that she&#8217;s unable to help this terribly damaged man.Can Cole become a whole person again &#8211; even though he&#8217;ll always be missing limbs? As Carly draws closer to him and begins to see Cole may actually contain a heart - a package from his past arrives for him and everything begins to fall apart for Cole. Carly has to leave and now alone, Cole now faces an even greater battle than he did while on active duty. Can he battle his demons enough to let in the only one that can help? And could the contents of the package that broke his resolve, possibly be also what&#8217;s needed to pull him back together again?This modern-day retelling of the classic Beauty and the Beast story was intensely heart-stirring and inspiring! Barely able to pause from reading, I was surely a captive of this heart-rending though heart-warming novella, as Cole Harrison was of his precarious mental prison. 'At the Edge of a Dark Forest' is immensely well-written, but what I found particularly engaging, were the conversations and thoughts of the characters&#8230; They were exceptionally realistic and captivating throughout the entire story! The romance was also tender, sweet, and credible, and brought an overall sheen to this uplifting tale. It is a story that discerningly demonstrates that it is only God that can renew our spirit and fulfill our deepest needs. Thank you Connie Almony for this remarkable story, that is both a tribute to the brave men who risk life and limb to fight for our freedom, as well as those who work tirelessly to help those brave men recover from the ravages of war with the assistance of prosthetic limbs. Highly recommended!!

$REVIEW.: I received a gifted copy from the author in exchange for my honest review, so here it is. The story of Joss Jamison and his betrayal of his friends is eating him alive. It has destroyed his friendship with Walsh, who is like a brother, and Tammy, Walsh's girlfriend since they were 14 years old. Walsh and Tammy are Joss's family for more years than he can count. And after his mother died and Walsh goes through rehab, Joss is fighting his despair and the betrayal that keeps his world in the dark. That is until Melanie walks into his world. Mel is Tammy's younger sister, and Joss sees the light he is searching for. Can Mel help Joss to move from the darkness into the light? Will Joss's betrayal keep eating him alive or will it be revealed? Will the band and members of Lush survive when the betrayal is revealed? This is a perfect story that will tear out your heart and having you crying. I was crying so hard, I had to stop reading and walk away until I calmed down. There are not many stories that get to me like this one. The last one was The Edge of Never by J.A. Redmerski. This book has ripped my heart out and Selena has put it back together. Another great story by Selena Laurence and I can't wait for more.**Wicked Reads Review Team**

$review_text.: As I sit here writing this review I am at a loss for words. I really had no idea of what to expect with this story. It was a free download that I put on my kindle shelf and let it sit there. Then just the other day I decided it is high time I stop buying more books and start reading all the unread books that I have gotten for free. I figured it would go one of two ways: I either hate the book or love the book and find a new author I haven't read before. Well guess what. That is exactly what happened! I found a book that I loved! In fact I started reading it this morning and then two hours into it I realized I was late for work. Where did the time go?This story deals with emotional abuse. Just because you can't see visible bruises or scars doesn't mean it is just as damaging to someone.  Often times it is worse. The verbal garbage that was spewed to Charlie was... I can't even put to words what I felt. All I can say is I really hated her father and her mother for the way they treated Charlie. Her father was the worse with the verbal abuse but her mother was just as bad even though she never said a bad word towards her daughter. She continued to let her husband mouth off one nasty remark after another and never said a word.This abuse continued for years until Charlie's dad relocates him to another city. Here she starts a new school and has the unfortunate luck of running smack into the schools gorgeous and hot quarterback named Maverick and he sends her falling flat back on her ass. Well who knew that moment would be the start of a great relationship. She also finds a true friend Tori that shows her how awesome she is also. I really loved watching Charlie slowly come out of her shell with Maverick. He loved her the moment he met her and I really thought this was going to lead to a HEA for these two. But then we all know that is all great love stories that is never the case.This story is definitely a book that I suggest reading. It will suck you in and make you lose time. If I had it my way I would have read this straight through and not even realize I did that. It was that good.

Maze, and, indeed, "Wisp: A Small Town Nightmare," could have been.Rife with that wonderful, small town feel, the quaint community of Ellerton, Alabama is but a pinprick on the map, much in the same vein as a Norman Rockwell portrait, our beloved Mayberry, or, more closely in nature, Frank Peretti's Ashton: where everyone knows everyone and everyone's business... including the dark little secrets."Wisp: A Small Town Nightmare" lives up to every letter of its title and then some.  One ride around the outskirts with Sheriff Murphy or Deputy Bass, and the reader will be spooked by every creepy corner and dark nook the little town displays while guarding its collective secret.  Fans of Peretti's "The Oath" or "Darkness" series will be eerily delighted with the spiritual warfare theme, as that sinister voice whispers over the shoulder, "Something's lurking about this close-knit community, some type of cryptic shadow, and it isn't pretty."One word of warning: the reader will be mercilessly baited by "carrot dangling."  Despite being a typical tool of an author's craft-  enticing the mind with liberal doses of suspense upon the closing of each chapter-  author Kevin R. Maze has proven himself an instant and atypical master of this art.  Every chapter fades in a manner that implores the reader to burn through another page."The night had its own music..." and its closely guarded secret is whispered through the night-wind's wisp of Ellerton.

$review_text.: I bought this book when I was expecting my 4th child. It really helped me understand the dynamics of parenting. I now have 7 children, and would recommend this book hands-down as the best advice on raising children outside of the Bible. IF YOU LOVE YOUR CHILD, GET THIS BOOK.I do not get perfect results because I am not as consistent as I should be. But if you apply them CONSISTENTLY and in LOVE, never out of anger (which the Pearls vehemently discourage), it is proper and never abuse.Michael Pearl even says if you cannot administer discipline with no malice, it is better not to do it at all. Detractors of this book and their ministry are misguided and snatching a patchwork of quotes to make their case, but probably have not read the whole book, or are so blinded by their aversion to corporal punishment they do not see the whole picture.

$review_text.: I've only used a few of the recipes, so far, but with good results

I've made the Cranberry Nut Bread and and the Lemon Cream Loaf, both of which everyone loved

I, also, used the spice mix for the Cajun Deep-Fried Turkey

It worked well for my turkey, consists of spices I have in my cupboard, and was very inexpensive to make, especially compared to purchasing the Cajun marinade


There are several other recipes I'm looking forward to trying.The only other review was from someone who never looked at the book "because of the many misspellings in the introduction."  The intro could use some work, but there are only two misspelled words, which I'm sure are typos
The main problem with the intro is you tend to get lost in the long run-on sentences
This does not affect the recipes.I got my copy for free and I'm definitely enjoying it.

I also don't buy into the war stratagies that is employed seems tovesdy and straight forward.That said still a solid read with some good carecter development.

$review_text.: Find out how some want-to-be modern day American pirates, who wanted to experience the thrill of robbing a party yacht, ended up in a quagmire that forces them to defend their turf and fight for their lives. The author mystifies the reader when she allows her adventurous characters, who were so  excited about being modern-day pirates, to at first enjoy their bad deeds then later on, suffer the consequences of their poor choices. These characters became stressed by an unknown, imminent danger. Also, it was interesting how John, the main character, chooses to seek revenge toward the man who stole is girl. This part added some romantic flavor to the text and helped to make clear the main character&#8217;s motivation. I loved reading this pirate adventure on the Great Lakes!

$review_text.: Ellen Schultz is an investigative reporter for the Wall Street Journal
She wrote in the Introduction to this 2011 book that it "explains what really happened to ..


the retirement benefits of millions of Americans at thousands of companies


No one disputes that there's a retirement crisis, but the crisis was no demographic accident


It was manufactured by an alliance of two groups: top executives and their facilitators in the retirement industry---benefits consultants, insurance companies, and banks---all of whom played a huge and hidden role in the death spiral of American pensions and benefits..

the masterminds responsible for the retirement crisis have walked away blame-free."She laments, "There's no way to know how many billions of dollars in pension assets vanished into the coffers of dealmakers in the frenzy of acquisitions, mergers, spin-offs, and the like, because the details are concealed in non-public-disclosure documents." (Pg
18) She observes, "Companies blame investment losses for their plight, as well as their aging workforces, union contracts, regulation, and global competition
But their funding problems were largely self-inflicted

Had they not siphoned off the assets, they would have had a cushion that could have withstood even the market crash that troughed in March 2009." (Pg

27)She notes, "In the euphoria of the bull markets, few analysts noticed that a big chunk of company profits was coming from the pension plans..

Pensions not only generated profits; they also became tools to manage earnings, thanks for the enormous control employers had over the size and timing of pension profits." (Pg
58-59)She points out that in deferred compensation plans "The participant doesn't actually receive the pay before he defers it; it is merely an IOU from his employer


Another way to put it: Employers have been putting much of their spiraling executive pay---pensions and deferred compensation---on the equivalent of a giant credit card." (Pg


101) Later, she adds, "for all the beefing people are doing about public pensions, they don't realize that executive liabilities are the equivalent of having a public pension plan buried in the balance sheet: the liabilities can spike in the final years, are hidden, understated, growing, and underfunded..." (Pg


203)She asserts, "The architects of today's retirement mess---consultants and financial firms---..


helped private employers hide pension cuts and exaggerate their pension woes, they also helped public employers quietly boost benefits and hide the growing liabilities..
the scapegoats are the public employees and retirees..
The real culprits are the self-serving politicians and officials who passed the funding back to future generations, the consulting firms that helped them do this, and the investment banks that conned local governments into investing taxpayer-funded pensions in risky, abusive investments." (Pg
213-214)This is an excellent, very insightful book about a subject that took few books have been written about.

$review_text.: Ms. Tushmore is amazingly talented. She manages to take the reader from the early formation of a rock band by some scrappy 1980's London stoners-with-issues all the way to rock stardome and, eventually, love - all without boring the reader to death, as so many "rock" epics have done. No waiting for the good parts. All the parts are good.Her treatment of the two main characters, Brandon and Sky, is not your run-of-the-mill gay romance formula. Brandon is a bisexual who likes to wear a fox stole onstage and off. Sky is the more disciplined musician (and son of one, as well) who is, quite bluntly, asexual.The path before them is strewn with obstacles, mostly of their own making. Sky, who had never had an experience with a man before he fell into bed with Brandon, keeps up a love/hate, passion/anger relationship with Brandon until it all falls apart in one incredibly well-drawn scene in which they end up punching each other out in the midst of a live performance - for all the world to see.Both are inexperienced at love (though not at sex). Both have difficulty dealing with it honestly until, finally, at the last pages, they agree to give a real relationship a try.The writing is impeccable, the editing superb. There's not a dull moment in the entire book.It wasn't until I began to write this review that I realized I had read another of Ms. Tushmore's gay romances and loved it, as well - "Haunted Pub". And like that one, this one has a totally over-the-top ending that both made me smile and tugged at my heartstrings at the same time.This is an author whose work I will continue to watch for and read. I recommend both the book and the author most highly!

$review_text.: As I've noted in other reviews, I have a long and deep interest in material culture -- the physical artifacts produced by the way we live, which often are the only surviving evidence of our everyday history. In college nearly fifty years ago, as a trainee historian but also for its cheap entertainment value, I got in the habit of attending estate sales (even though I couldn't afford to buy anything), just to prowl around the leftovers of some family's earlier generations: Pocket watches and fobs, oddball kitchen implements and mysterious silverware, uncomfortable parlor furniture. I found it all fascinating, and often puzzling. ("What did they do with that?") Ames is a noted essayist on such things and is known for his original perspective on domestic archaeology from the 19th century, not only examining and describing but explaining (for instance) why the American rocking chair developed the way it did, and why tilting one's chair back is fraught with psychological meaning, and the special status of the parlor organ. For that matter, why was it important for the upwardly mobile family moving into a new house to have a back hall as well as a front hall? What was the point of self-consciously embellishing the printed mottoes on the wall (and the titles on the covers of books) to the point almost of unreadability? Design can be subversive, serving other purposes than merely abstract aesthetics, whether it's the furthering of evangelical religious dogma or underlining relative status within the middle-class family. The book's title, by the way, comes from the chapter on the depiction of nature and "plenty" on dining room sideboards, which in the mid-19th century nearly crossed the line into architecture in their sheer size and complexity of carving. This is a great book for thoughtful browsing and for gazing at the period illustrations on every page. There's also an excellent annotated notes and bibliography section.

$review_text.: Jeff Doyle's 2nd edition of his best-selling book - "Routing TCI/IP Volume 1" is a welcome revision to the cannon required for any CCIE Routing & Switching candidate.  Jeff Doyle, along with Jennifer Carroll, has done an excellent job at updating what is considered by many to be THE book on routing.  In particular, the new edition does a terrific job at describing the white-elephant in the room - IPv6, IPv6's packet format and how to configure some routing protocols to advertise IPv6 prefixes.The primary focus of this book discusses the most popular routing protocols - RIPv1 & RIPv2, EIGRP, OSPFv2 and, particular to IPv6, RIPng and OSPFv3.  Dedicating over 450 pages to these topics alone makes the book worth itself.  A further 130 pages are used to discuss route control (redistribution, filtering and route-maps).In particular, I was impressed by:* The book is fully-updated, and is not just a copy-and-paste of subject matter from the first book.  For instance, on page 439 is discussed the use of a much misunderstood newer command `area nssa translate type7 suppress-fa'.  This is just an example of complex and new commands that are documented.* Of all the books I have looked at, this book does the best job at introducing oneself to RIPng.* The book wastes little time discussing site-local addresses for IPv6.  As the difficulties of using of IPv6's site-local addresses has rendered ths address as too complex to implement (and was, in fact, deprecated in RFC 3879), this books notes this and moves on.  This goes against other recent books that that wastes pages and time discussing IPv6 site-local addresses.  As any CCIE candidate will attest, studying time comes at a premium.There are few cons worth mentioning:* The book repeatedly incorrectly documents IPv6's link-local addresses as FF80::/10.  Link-local addresses start as FE80::/10.*IS-IS is discussed (which is no longer on the CCIE R&S; lab).  The book went to press too late to discuss EIGRP for IPv6 and is sorely missed.*The book does bypass some interesting subtleties that you know Doyle is aware of but are, for the most part, undocumented.  For instance, the differences between EIGRP and RIP when using the neighbor command.The path to the CCIE R&S; can be a long (and costly) road.  While this book is focused towards candidates for CCIE Routing & Switching Lab, I believe this book would be a welcome addition to any Networkers' bookshelf.I give this book 5 pings out of 5:!!!!!

$review_text.: This was a really interesting book. It's not a typical romance, but more of a women's fiction book. The complexities of the abortion issues are handled with tact and show both sides of the fence; pro-life and pro-choice, and neither is taken lightly. I thought the characters were relatable and real, and there were several points in the story where I wasn't sure which way it would go. I really liked that about it. It held my interest and made me keep turning the pages.This book has secrets and heartbreak, but it also has redemption and is a study in forgiveness. I won't give away any spoilers, but if you like complex stories with meaning, this is a great choice. Be ready for a roller coaster of emotions!

$REVIEW.: By: Steve TurnerThe band that played on is an in-depth look into the lives of the eight members of the band on the Titanic. They played until their final breath, helping keeping those left on the titanic calm in the face of death.  The book focuses on the band, but also talks about the sinking, and about the families that the band left behind. The book was well thought out and very well researched I saw that throughout the book as I read. It is on topic and doesn't shift to other things it stays with the bands story.I really enjoyed this book and all that was said about the band was very interesting and educational. Being homeschooled, it was a great thing to read for history and I learned a lot I never knew about the sinking. It was a great book to read and would recommend into any history lover or anyone interested in learning more about the titanic and the people on board. But it is more of a "fact" book then a memoir to the band. I would give this a 6 out of 10.I was not made to write a positive review, only to voice my opinion.

$REVIEW.: I was out of the comic book reading hobby for several years, but I have to say that I was glad that i came back to reading comic books again. One of the first titles that hooked me this second time around was Kirkman's The Walking Dead for Image Comics. I have to say that its taken the current renaissance of zombie films and books and ran away with it.Using the same slow, shambling zombies that Romero first made popular with Night of the Living Dead and its subsequent sequels, Kirkman continues the story where Romero usually ended his films. All those times people have wondered what happened to those who survived in zombie films need not imagine anymore. Kirkman has created a believable world where the dead have risen to feast on the living, but has concentrated more on the human dynamic of survival in the face of approaching extinction.I won't say that the story arc collected in this first volume has little or no zombies seen, but they've taken on more as an apocalyptic prop. One can almost substitute some other type of doom in place of zombies and still get a similar effect (as was done in Brian K Vaughn's equally great series, Y: The Last Man). What Kirkman's done is show how humanity's last survivors are now constantly, desperately adapting to a familiar world through unfamiliar circumstances. Characters from the start make the sort of mistakes regular people would make when they don't know exactly everything that is happening around them. Instead of chiding these people as one reads their story, we sympathize and hope for their continued survival.I am hopeful that the rest of the collected trades will be equal to and maybe surpass this first story-arc. Already kirkman's done more to realizing the universe Romero created than alot of the hack filmmakers who have taken Romero's idea and cannibalized it for their own profit. I consider The Walking Dead as a must-read for anyone looking to find something different from all the costumed superhero titles.

$review_text.: True confession: I have never read Alice in Wonderland. I have, however, seen the Disney cartoon and the Tim Burton movie; how accurately they films follow the text is something I don't know. But I can say that I have never really been a fan. Who I am a fan of, though, is Colleen Oakes. I'll read anything and everything she writes - and I'll probably love it, too. I certainly did love Queen of Hearts.This book is the first in the Queen of Hearts saga, a planned trilogy set in the fantasy realm of Wonderland. the story is Dinah's - the first-born child of the King and Queen of Hearts - of &#34;off with their heads!&#34; fame. A 15-year-old girl when the story begins, Dinah is learning to someday rule the land. (But she would much rather be spending her days with her best friend - and the boy she loves - Wardley, and indulging with tarts. Be honest: wouldn't we all?) But the closer her coronation comes, them more the royal castle shimmers with suspicion. Dinah's father is cruel; a black-hearted ruler more feared than he is loved by his subjects. And it seems his hatred toward his daughter grows daily.In short, this is a fantastic story. Filled with familiar characters - the white &#34;rabbit&#34; always hopping about excited about the time, the Cheshire &#34;cat,&#34; the mad hatter, and even the decks of cards. It's crafty, clever, and oh so captivating. A glimpse behind the crown, showing us how the fairy tale queen - always seen as cruel, evil, and bloodthirsty, ordering the beheading of so many - truly came to power and nearly lost her own head.Queen of Hearts has a bit of everything - romance, fantasy, action, adventure, and intrigue. Not to mention a cliff-hanger ending that left me (blood)thirsty for more!

$REVIEW.: Danny Calloway and the Puzzle House is a story about a young boy who is extremely gifted with numbers and subsequently, solving codes/cyphers. When Danny turns 13, he inherits his grandfathers house. Much to the chagrin of Danny, he has to spend his summer at the house preparing it to be sold.What Danny quickly learns is that the house is full of riddles and puzzles that lead Danny, his cousin, and their friend Molly on a treasure hunt. Filled with danger, secret societies, and treasures beyond imagination this book (and hopefully the rest of the coming series) is a fantastic story that you are sure to love.I bought this book on 5/10 and finished it on 5/11.  It was extremely difficult to put down and I just blew right through it. I am actually really looking forward to reading it to others.So with me saying that it is a fantastic story, why do I only give it 4 stars? I'm glad you asked. There was one thing that nagged on me about halfway through the book.::Right now is where I tell you that the follow section could potentially contain spoilers, although nothing detrimental to the story itself.::What bothered me was that Danny's dad and his uncle were preparing the house for sale and the house contained locked doors to rooms that needed special keys which could only be obtained by solving puzzles. Wouldn't Danny's dad and uncle have found a way into those rooms (either by picking the lock or some other means) in order to prepare those portions of the house as well? Maybe it isn't that big of a deal and I'm the only one who had thought this, but it still bothered me nonetheless.Despite this, I highly recommend this book as a great story to be read and shared with the family. I'm highly looking forward to the next one in the series.

I'm not sure if the author is going somewhere with the family or not, but both girls fathers are gone, both mothers are druggies and psychotic, and they both have older brothers.  They are almost the same except one see's others deaths.  Getting into the mind of the main character was easy and the story was consistently told through her eyes.  The reader can not know anything going on that the protagonist doesn't know, however, the author does an excellent job of filling in the unknowns as the book progresses.  The reason she falls for one guy over the other is easy to understand and the love scenes are sweet.My only issue with the book is that it doesn't end.  The reader is forced to buy another book just to know how things turn out.  If you want a complete story, this is not the book for you.  If you like the soap-opera style books, then this is a great read.  I however prefer the single book with a great ending versus being forced to buy more, but this style book seems to be the trend with publishers now so I don't blame the author.  Great story, but I'm left frustrated with no ending and will not buy the sequel knowing that it will more than likely only leave me frustrated again without a clear ending.

$review_text.: For those craving more futuristic design books, the Robertson works are highly desirable

 He's no Syd Mead or Ron Cobb, but his works are slick, and well-rendered


 A note of caution however; he is a much better artist of ground vehicles than aircraft
 Most of his air vehicles are obviously derived from passenger car sketches, sans wheels


 If you have the funds for both of Robertson's books, great
 If you can only buy one of them, buy his book on ground vehicles.

$REVIEW.: I like the idea of this book, following the lives of multiple students and the events that lead up to a school shooting. Unfortunately, the labels attached to the various students are about as complex as the novel gets when dealing with the various characters. If the students had been more fleshed out, I would have liked this book so much more.Instead, you get a mystery - Who has gone on a killing spree at the school? - that isn't compelling. It's hard enough to remember who is who with so many characters, especially when none of them are given much depth beyond their assigned labels. I think this would have been much more powerful if the author had spent more time developing her characters. And the central conceit - we don't know who the killer is until the end - is weakened considerably by how little time the author spends on the shooting itself. It's difficult to create any suspense if you only touch on the students trapped in the school once every 8 or 10 chapters.Along with the lack of characterization, I wish the author had spent more time dealing with the trapped kids and exploring their stress, horror, and confusion. This could have been a really good book. Instead, it was very disappointing.
$SUMMARY.: It had potential to be so much more

$review_text.: I'm a big fan of board games, so much so I'm terrified the huge collection of them in my closet will someday collapse and bury me alive. Settlers of Catan is the game that gets played most in my family. Why? Several reasons:1. The whole fantasy of settling an island, building roads, ports and cities is fun.2. It has a perfect mix of strategy and luck.3. Anyone age eight and up can play and have an almost equal chance of winning. I'll help the kids choose their starting places, but after that, they're on their own--and they do win as often as the adults do.4. While the instructions seem complicated at first, once you start playing, you discover the rules are actually brilliantly simple.5. Because you assemble the island before you start, you can make it a different game every time you play.6. The Seafarer's Expansion makes the game even better.7. Games are neither too short nor too long.8. Everyone plays with ever turn, so no one gets bored waiting for his or her turn.My only quibbles:1. You can only play the game with 3-4 players, although expansion packs let you play with 5-6.2. The cardboard pieces have warped over time, although this could be because a young guest accidentally turned ours into her own "seafarer's edition" by spilling water on it. The game isn't cheap, so it's a shame the pieces aren't made of sturdier stuff.3. We're not crazy about thieves blocking resources, so we've changed that to allow for bribes. Essentially, if you roll a seven or play a knight card, you can choose one card from any player. Resources are only blocked if the other player doesn't agree to fork over the card.This is the best board game you can buy that the entire family can play without ever a dull moment. Highly recommended.

$review_text.: I had read the Seth material, enjoyed, and appreciated it; however, I probably did not understand it well enough to be able to tell anyone else what it might mean
 It is just so encompassing and dense


 My husband recently became interested in learning about issues beyond the physical world and suggested that we read the Seth material together so we could talk about it hoping that it would make it easier for him to understand

 He was fascinated with the material but when I would try to explain my understanding of it to him so he could better comprehend it, I found that I do not understand it well enough for myself to be able to help him imagine what Seth was talking about

 So I read some reviews of other Jane Roberts works and thought perhaps reading the "Oversoul" trilogy would help


 At first I thought it was too simplistic and we might becocme bored with it; however, shortly, we both became fascinated with the characters and how they all fit together in the cosmos as it is described by Seth in the Seth material
 We both became engrossed with the story and the characters and we have found that it does make the Seth material come to life for us
 I highly recommend the book for anyone who wants to understand the Seth material or who just wants to be entertained by a charming book about a number of interesting characters and how they may all fit together in this wonderful experience called life on earth.

$REVIEW.: "Atheism and the Case Against Christ".  By Matthew  S. McCormick.  A book that probably should be called Atheism 101 for beginners.  It's one of the best books I have read recently that makes the case for atheism.  It is simple to where the average person will be able to understand it and comprehend it with no problems.  And you don't necessarily have to be college educated to understand it.  If they have had any doubts in the past about Christianity, this may convince you once and for all  he makes a case for nonbelief.It dissects the case against Christ actually having arose from the dead after being crucified.  The same methods and case can be made and used for every story in the Bible.  Something that a lot of us who were raised in the Christian religion and environment from birth knew years ago.  Most of what's in the Bible makes no sense.  At best they are fables.  The methods he uses are merely common sense methods and deductive reasoning exercises.  There is nothing elaborate about them, if you have the ability to reason for yourself, you will understand what he is talking about.So in reality, it hasn't changed my mind much about Christianity.  I  doubted most of it from the time I was a child and had it shoved down my throat regularly 24 hours a day, seven days a week and 365 days a year.  My father meant well with all the religion, unfortunately society leads parents to believe religion is necessary in order to be a moral person.  Which is far from the truth as one can get.  It's just that such an excess often turns one against it early in life.  I could never buy most of the Bible.  It requires the believers ability to believe in the supernatural.  Which is something I have never be able to do.  I am a born cynic and always have been one, so Christianity was a cross I had to bear as a child.I will always remember my Mother telling me of an incident that took place after my Dad died in the 70's.  He supposedly came back in a vision late one night, to let her know there was life after death.  But, I now know it was a 'bereavement hallucination' that she was having.  At the time, I didn't think she had taken complete leave of her senses, I believed she had experience something even though I still do not believe in the supernatural.  I thought at the time it was some sort of a hallucination that came from her religious beliefs.  And I was right it's explained in this book.So, this is one of the better books I have read recently in regards to the subject of nonbelief. So many books get into the scientific evidence not to believe and they get to deep and complicated to where the average person like myself has a hard time comprehending it.  So in that respect, this is one of the better  books that the average lay person will have no difficulty in understanding.  He doesn't delve into the scientific reasons not to believe but deals more in the psychological reasons for human error and lack of actual evidence.  It makes the case not to believe.

$review_text.: (Although I got this book for review my review is still 100% honest.)This book was amazing. True Fact. Its the second book in the Izzy Chronicles and all I want to do is read more of this series. This book starts after a couple of months from the where the first one ended. Well Izzy's life is about to flip again. Going from living a dream life with her man Kennan to having to save the world the next.Izzy goes through more changes within this book. She discovers more of her powers that was never known to exist. She still has the same attitude in this book has she does in the first but I feel as though she is getting more responsible. She had to make really hard choices and stick to them, I know I probably wouldn't have been able to. Kennan is hiding more things from Izzy within in this book then you can possibly imagine. This of course would cause a strain in any relationship. Their love for each other is still strong though and it does pull on your heart strings a lot.Their was two new characters introduced in this book that I think were well worth a mention. The first is Conall. He is another guardian same as Kennan or Ian. He has a very strong loyalty to Kennan and wouldn't do anything to disrupt that.  He has a terrible past and is willing to do anything to stop it from happening again. His character was really interesting, he was a very serious character.The next character introduced in this book is Aberto. Aberto now he is something different that hasn't been seen in hundreds of years. He is an old one a being who is human but has mystery shrouded well around him. I really enjoyed this character I found it strange how much he cared for Izzy. Aberto and Izzys banter was really amusing through most of the book.So I'd have to say that this book was better than the first. Even though I really enjoyed the first one this one had more mystery within it and really got you excited for what would happen next. I had a really hard time putting this one down . Izzy's story is just getting more and more crazy. I'd have to say that this one made me almost want to cry a few time. I really want to find out what happens next in this series.

$review_text.: There was a time when public figures with significant views on the great issues of the day would write pamphlets or treatises, even short books, detailing their positions


 One thinks, for instance, of such writers as Thomas Paine and Alexander Hamilton at the time of the Founding, or in recent decades of Barry Goldwater's great book The Conscience of a Conservative, or William Simon's A Time for Truth

 These are all polemical works, meant to argue for political positions, which, though intensely personal, are uncluttered by personality

 They served an essential public service by addressing vital questions in a brief and readable form

 As a result, they were widely read and quite influential.Today, at a time when even White House pets have bestselling memoirs, these kinds of arguments are now grafted on to autobiographical texts for no discernible reason other than to exploit the current trend in publishing


 It was with some trepidation then that I approached Ward Connerly's book, Creating Equal

 I admire him and the battle he has waged over the past decade, but I honestly expected to skim through the typically pro forma story of his life to get to the meatier sections where he would present the intellectual case against racial preference programs

 But an unexpected thing happened on the way through the boring bits; it turns out that, though much of his tale is familiar, Ward Connerly's own life experience is one of his best arguments.As is common in American society, and only getting more so, Connerly comes of mixed racial stock : Black, White, and Native American
 He is &quot;Black&quot; only by the terms of the ancient and racist &quot;one drop rule&quot; and by family tradition; in reality his race defies categorization
 He did not meet his father until very late in life and, his mother having died, was raised first by an aunt and uncle, then by his grandmother


 His grandmother and uncle were the real formative influences on his character, both of them strict and demanding that he make something of himself

 His Uncle James in particular was a role model, asking only one thing of life : that people treat him like a man; in exchange always carrying himself like one


 Together they instilled in Connerly a burning desire to be judged on his own merit.It thus seems natural that when, as a member of the University of California Board of Regents, Connerly was approached by a couple who had statistical evidence of the use of quotas by the UC colleges, he turned their cause into his cause

 His account of the battle for Proposition 209, the California Civil Rights Initiative, and then subsequent contests in Washington, Texas and Florida, make for interesting reading, though they are perhaps not as viscerally powerful as the story of his early life.Throughout the book, Connerly is animated by a simple timeless creed which gives the book its title :I celebrated July 4 1995 with a heightened awareness of the personal freedom at the core of  nationhood


 When the Founding Fathers said that we were all created equal, they were proposing an  audacious theory that ultimately inflamed the rest of the world

 By fits and starts, Americans had  tried to make that theory into a reality, with abolitionism, the Emancipation Proclamation, and, of  course, the civil rights movement, which instituted sweeping revisions of the law that have brought  us ever closer to the fulfillment of the promise of our national life


 I felt in my heart that race  preferences--by whatever name--were not a continuation of that progress, but an obstacle in the road  to freedom and equality


 At best a diversion, and at worst a giant step backward, affirmative action  preferences caused us to lose sight of the task we inherited from the Founders--creating equal as the  only category that counts in America.There's a deep irony in the fact that these beliefs, traceable to Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of Independence and Martin Luther King's &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech, should now make Ward Connerly anathema to the Democratic Party and to the institutionalized civil rights movement


 We have reached a sad point in our nation's history where to the inheritors of the legacy of Jefferson and King the idea of a color blind society has been transmuted into a weird kind of racism itself

 It should not have required courage to, as Connerly boldly does, advocate that race be ignored in awarding government jobs and contracts, but it did, and this demonstration of courage makes Connerly into a heroic figure, willing to brave epithets, threats and hatreds to vindicate his convictions

 This memoir, harkening back to The Autobiography of Ben Franklin and Booker T
Washington's Up From Slavery, partakes of the great American tradition of self-reliance and the demand that each of us be judged individually; this gives it an impact all out of proportion to what I expected.GRADE : A

$REVIEW.: This was a tough one for me.  I think a large part of my dislike of the story was the sister.  She was exceptionally selfish and I found myself wanting to skip any sections that had her in them.  I also didn't completely get the premise of the story.  Yes, it was unrequited love, but with the 14 year old daughter and her nurse in the picture (and the crazy sister), this story was just too busy with character development to continue reading for what looked like it would become a low key steady romance.  I stopped reading at about the 30% mark.

$REVIEW.: When I elected to review this book, I was hoping for a truly nonpartisan, nondenominational book that would dispassionately discuss the very important topic of virtues and which I could use in the classes I teach about virtues and values.  I found that the writing, itself, is well done and literate.  Frankly, though, I nearly put it down after page 2 where it appears to want to dictate that teachers must display only pictures of American presidents on their walls . . . now doesn't THAT smack of totalitarianism?  But I did hang in there -- only to be overall disappointed.Basically this book examines what it terms virtues and values from a political, fairly polarized point of view.  Some chapters, like those on individuality and responsibility seem fairly dispassionate, but others like the one on education become little more than political tirade against the current administration, blaming President Obama for everything.  At the end of the chapter on capitalism, this book blames "progressives" for ignoring the lessons of economic history, yet in the very next chapter (education), this book itself ignores the equally real lesson of political history that the president does not control all that happens during his administration.Both political sides in our country achieve their stance by ignoring the total picture -- I was hoping for a balanced book that would not do this.  In the main I was disappointed.

$REVIEW.: This book was such a treat. The emotion Rossi evokes is real and universal. His hero is flawed and both mourns those flaws and accepts their inevitability. He doesn't let the problems, inside or out, keep him from solving this fascinating mystery. The action here is subtle and suspenseful, inside a world that feels both mind-boggling impossible and painfully real.Great read.

$REVIEW.: This is the second series that I've read by Kalin and I've been blown away by her writing both times, her stories are fantastic and I'm definitely going to be checking out all of her other books and series.Having never really been a fan of contemporary romance I've been very surprised with the few that I've read this year and Loving Summer is no exception.Summer has invited the Donovan's: Rachel, her twin brother Drew and their older brother Nat whom Summer has had a crush on ever since she was a little to her Aunt Sookie's beach house,  what used to be a yearly thing  has tapered off and this will be the first time they've seen each other in years.Nat has a girlfriend and Drew is now a walking one night stand and Summer starts to feel attracted to Drew while also harboring feelings for Nat, and then she starts dating tv star Astor and develops feelings for him too, what's a girl to do with three gorgeous guys whom may or may not all have feelings for her.I personally would choose Drew, he's so sweet and while his twin Rachel has warned him off Summer so as not to ruin their friendship I think they'd make a great couple.I loved all the characters in this book, I laughed, I cried and I'm extremely, impatiently hanging out for the next book.A great summer read or if you want a light contemporary romance to put a smile on your face, definitely pick this one up.I give this 5/5.

A Lot of missing parts and predicable plots


All three books were the same but with different names and places

$review_text.: I was so excited to read this I cannot even tell you. I read and loved Crow's Row. It will forever be one of my favorites. I know the author caught a lot of flack from this book for different reasons. I personally, have zero issues with the book. I loved this sequel and holy smokes, cannot wait for book 3. It is so hard to review this because I am afraid of spoilers. Lets just say Emily is awesome! She has had so much to deal with it. I want to see her grow even more in the next book. I am so invested in her journey to see where Julie will take her. I love Cameron and I don't know how he was able to do what he did, to keep her safe. Ugh!! The biggest thing in this sequel is I have fallen for Griff. He is such a good guy. I don't want anything bad to happen to him! He has been there for Emily and I am officially torn.

$REVIEW.: I really enjoyed this book.It deals with an era in professional football that is slightly ahead of my time. (early 60's), but fills in a lot of the gaps that led up to the modern era in professional football and the NFL.The detail with which the author places the reader within the context of that era, is the strong point of this book.I remember my older siblings sharing with me, their experience of "traveling scrimmage" games from both Football and Basketball teams of that time.There is also good information regarding the "regional" naming of the Bowl games from years past.  It's fun to know that the Sugar bowl was name after the Louisiana region that grows that crop.  Similarly with the Cotton, Orange & Rose Bowls.  When compared to the modern era of corporate sponsorship, it gives the reader a good historical perspective.The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is that my personal reading enjoyment is lessened when there is too much detail about individual players, and toward the mid section of the book, it get's a little bogged down for me personally.For anyone who really enjoys football, and especially this era in professional football, you will enjoy this book.  (also, there are some great B/W photos toward the back that further capture the time and place)AS PART OF FULL DISCLOSURE, THIS BOOK WAS PROVIDED TO ME FOR FREE FOR REVIEW.THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW IT.

$REVIEW.: A very excellent and fast-paced sequel to Tempest, I enjoyed it even more than the first book. I love geology and so the volcano tie-in was even more awesome to me than the hurricane premise. Kenna was a wonderful protagonist, and I greatly enjoyed getting to know Janelle and Gary more. I had forgotten how cute the two of them were in Tempest, so it was great to see them again. There were also lots of unexpected plot twists that actually had me shrieking, "OMG!!" out loud. Holly Hook is a master at writing suspense, so you will definitely be at the edge of your seat. I very highly recommend the Destroyers series!

I understand she has been through a tremendous tragedy and what older brother wouldn't want to be protective but they seem a little too close.  All the &#34;I love yous&#34; get to be a little bit to much.Dillon is an interesting twist to the story especially at the end of the book, holy cliffhanger!!  (At least I hope its a cliffhanger)Jake and Becca's relationship is very sweet and caring I wish they would have developed into a little more during the book, but than again it wouldn't be able to be called &#34;Lonely Girl&#34;I think the twists and turns in this book are to die for!  I was excited and there was a new turn almost every other chapter, not to mention we need to constantly keep our eye out for Dillion.I liked Keegan at first and I hoped that Becca and him ended up together...that is until Jake.All in all I think the book was well written and it kept me interested I hope hope hope that the end is a cliffhanger and there will be more for the lonely girl...Becca.

$review_text.: I'm not into BDSM

 In fact; I've read thousands of fictional books and maybe 5 of them might have had BDSM inside

 I'm also not into first-person writing and this book is written in the first-person

 Why'd I read it then?Well; I was just coming off having read the 'Fifty Shades' series which is somewhat BDSM involved
 I read that because a news program called that series 'Mommy-Porn' and I wanted to know what all that hoopla was about
 I enjoyed that series too

 When I was reading the reviews for that series I saw more than one reference to this book (The Reluctant Dom)
 People mentioned how emotional this book was and how well written
 It got me curious enough to find a copy at a local used book store and here I am: post-reading The Reluctant Dom.Frankly; this was one of the best fictional books I've ever read


 It's written in a way that sucks the reader in and holds them tight

 I just don't exactly get the BDSM stuff and plowed my way through those parts because of the emotional content


 I haven't been this moved by a book in a long, long time


The depth to which the writer has written her characters is excellent
 We're reading in first-person but are given a very clear understanding of each character; be it Kaden, Leah, or Seth (the first-person in this book).For the last 20% of the book 8 kleenix gave-up their lives!I really can't say enough for the writer's talent in creating this wonderful story of love, loss, adjustment, and relationships
 It's a tale as old as time and yet; this book brings out new facets to someone like me who has read so many books


 Mostly; this story makes the reader FEEL.Thank you Dear Authoress
 I loved it
 I'm looking forward to reading Tony's story when it comes out.

$REVIEW.: I could not get into it at the beginning. I was not feeling it until Vere and Hunter met. Then I started getting pulled in. I am glad I stuck it out because I really ended up enjoying the story. I like the characters and the relationship between Vere and her brother Charlie. I was on the fence about Vera's friend Jenna. I like the growth between Vere and Hunter over the course. You could feel the friendship not just the romance part of it. It felt more real that it was not instant.It was nice to have the character of Vere as she was not perfect but very likable. I liked the different points of view. I liked being in there heads. I prefer Hunter's more. He had more deep issues that it was interesting to explore and read how he dealt with them. He was complex rather than a flat character he could have been if the author was just going to sell the famous rock star plot. I like the changes in him and how he really started to communcate.I am glad I stuck it out. The font used didn't agree with me  but I got use to it.

$review_text.: When a villain with a coffeepot-shaped head -- a fella who probably wouldn't even have made the cut of Duck Twacy's list of leading adversaries -- gets second billing in a COMPLETE DICK TRACY volume, you know that you're heading into one of Chester Gould's relatively fallow creative periods, and so the period March 1947-September 1948 proves to be. Oh, some notable events occur -- B.O. Plenty and Gravel Gertie's daughter Sparkle Plenty is born, and Junior Tracy and some of his pals found the Crime Stoppers under Tracy's approving eye. But truly memorable villains are few and far between, with one huge exception: Mumbles, that heavy-lidded proto-Boomhauer himself, who would wind up rating not one but two comebacks, one in the mid-50s and the other (as a clone) in the late 70s. One reason for Mumbles' refusal to pass quietly was the simple fact that his first-class initial appearance, the saga of the rich-rifling Mumbles Quartette, whizzed past readers in a mere matter of six weeks. Almost before Gould (who was as ever working without planning ahead) realized what he had created, the story was over and Mumbles was (supposedly) dead. The contrast between this lightning-quick narrative and the slow-paced, overly derivative storyline that closes this volume, featuring midget con artist Heels Beals (does Richard know about him?) and his enormous inamorata Acres O'Riley, is a testament to the unevenness of Gould's work during this period.Max Allan Collins provides his usual informative opening commentary, but Jeff Kersten, in his closing essay "Of Pink Shirts and Power Struggles," displays a flexibility worthy of Stretch Armstrong in his attempts to dope out hidden political commentary in Gould's late-1940s work. The distinctive Eleanor Roosevelt-esque appearance of electronic-parts thief Mrs. Volts lends at least some credence to Kersten's claim that Gould meant the character to be a reference to the New Deal's attempt to establish control over the utility industry during the Depression. But Heels Beals as a metaphor for Harry Truman, "a seeming puppet of forces larger than himself"? From the way Beals throws his modest weight around and attempts to control those around him -- even unto attempting to off Tracy with a good, old-fashioned death trap -- it's hard to believe that Kersten actually read this continuity. And Mumbles and his Quartette, who use their performing group as a "front" to rob folks at parties, as symbolic of Soviet intelligence's co-opting of American progressivism... well, one could read such a message into the actions of any number of Tracy's adversaries, many of whom used "beards" of one sort or another to hide their illegal activities. Personally, I'm unaware of any continuity in which Gould took on Communism directly, save perhaps for the story featuring the vaguely radical Boris Arson back in the 1930s. Gould would make up for this, though, when the permissive 60s came along and he turned into a strident defender of the police. Nice try, Jeff, but sometimes a crook is simply a crook.
$SUMMARY.: Not Gould's best work, but well-packaged and well-presented as always

$review_text.: To read the word "siege" misspelled as "seige" repeatedly, and in bold-faced type made me uncomfortable. In a high-quality formatted, expensive reprint, this carelessness is inexcusable, and a sign of disrespect to the original author, and to readers as well. The interview with the editor at the end of the book seems a bit too much like popular history, only popular histories are usually more carefully edited. I hope the publisher addresses this issue in future editions, since this is an excellent work that deserves more loving care!  The other reviews posted are by Civil War scholars, some of whom have books published by the same company that released this book: come on, Mr.Gottfried, would you want this kind of editing in one of your atlases, or "brigades"? (I own several of your works)  Perhaps Mr.Savas could explain this epidemic of typographical errors: this could be overlooked in lesser works.

A very useful book, that builds on the first - Question Based Selling. I believe for todays selling environment serious sales people must read his books. He gets so much right immediately that one becomes so much better as a salesman so quickly. He offers useful approaches to everyday issues in selling. These range from major corporate through to being a start-up salesperson. How to deal with pricing, aggressive competitors, inside coaches and anti-coaches. There is so much value in here I wish he had written it earlier so I would have made even more sales.

$review_text.: Dragonspell, written by Donita K. Paul, is a Christian fantasy story about a girl who finds herself on an unbelievable quest.  Kale, a former slave, is sent by her people to deliver a dragon egg.  She ends up meeting two new friends, who turn her away from her original destination and help her realize her true skills and talents and the importance of serving Paladin (who resembles Jesus).  Through this journey, Kale learns that she is a dragon-keeper and has the ability to find dragon eggs.  She also has the ability to communicate through "mindspeak" or telepathy.  Kale and her friends are placed in extreme danger and must battle dark forces.Dragonspell is a clever fantasy fiction.  Donita K. Paul certainly has a wonderful imagination.  I love stories and movies about dragons and the premise of the story really sucked me in.  I was jealous of the fact that Kale can mindspeak, or in other words, use telepathy.  I would be using that skill all the time if I could!  I was glued to the book for the first half.  I then began to feel as though the story was dragging a tad bit, but then I felt it picked up again and I was glued to the end.  I think that Donita K. Paul adds a large amount of detail, which reminded me so much of when I read the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.  This was a very different book for me to read - I have never read a Christian fantasy book.  Overall, I thought it was a great way to encourage faith and certainly promotes discussion with young readers.

$review_text.: I received a complimentary copy of this book to review.I read the first two pages - and was hooked. This women's fiction story was compelling right from the start.  It is the story of Pearl Caldwell, a woman down on her luck in New Orleans, who is arrested.  She doesn't know why, and is thrown in jail to be forgotten by the system.Once reality sets in and Pearl comes to grips with the fact that she will not be released any time soon, she decides to make the most of her "free" time by writing.  Pearl begins by writing down her innermost thoughts and feelings - something she has always been afraid to do.  One by one, the inmates begin confiding in her - telling their stories.  Pearl listens.  And then begins writing these stories.  As more inmates find out about her writing, they all clamor to have their stories told and Pearl is the one who can do it.I could not put this book down - the more I read, the more I wanted.  I have to say that the ending left me stunned.  I hope there's a sequel!!

I am glad I did go back to it because I liked it.  The story line was good but the writing lacked substance.  I wanted to feel the pain Alianora must have felt.  I read about but didn't feel it.  The struggle she must have felt when choosing Lord Savernake instead of the man she loved Lord Cerestone. The fighting that took place between these men was the same I read about it but didn't see it in my mind's eye.  I have a vivid imagination when I read I am there feeling, and experiencing what the characters feel. For instance, someone can be describing something into great detail and I am either crying, gagging, or horrified.  So when I draw or paint I need to feel whatever the subject is if not my work doesn't express what I intended it to.

People have forgotten the difference between what's right and wrong and haven't the slightest care. Every internal thought that could have crossed the human mind comes to fruition. The lingering thought of the reader is primarily...what happened? I haven't read much in the Badlands series to see if a cause was uncovered, but as of the first installment, we are left hanging in wonderment as to what catastrophe could have cause humanity to turn so evil and lose all care of decency. It's a great read from great authors and wonderful, sometimes grotesque, artwork that fills your mind with a feeling of depravity.

Just because you aren't having it doesn't mean you don't know anything about it or aren't curious enough to look the information up online. I truly enjoyed that the author wrote in three person POV as it makes for an interesting read. I also liked the chemistry between the two characters. This book was quite a bit like 50 Shades but I could get past that. I would have liked to have had a bit more background on Liam and Sera as their characters seemed a bit underdeveloped to me but in saying that there was something about them that I liked. It could be that more details will be come out in the next book which is what I'm hoping will happen to explain why these characters are the way they are. If you are someone that doesn't like anything resembling 50 shades you will most likely not want to read this. If you like reading things similar to 50 Shades or you are just looking for a good read with some sexy scenes my guess is that you will want to pick this one up. Be forewarned there is a cliffhanger. I'm look forward to reading the next book in the series as I enjoy how Ms.Griffin writes and am anxious to see what direction she'll be taking Liam and Sera in. I also enjoyed the British lingo....although I have to admit I needed to look a few things up.  I thought that this was a great first book. Plenty of steamy sex scenes and a deflowering that any girl would have wished for their first time.
$SUMMARY.: Great First Book!!!

$review_text.: Short of the monarch, the only person who Sir Robert Carey would heed an order from to come to London is his father Lord Hunsdon the Queen's Lord Chamberlain. Robert knows that the big city has many individuals irate with him, as he owes them a lot of money. However, his father needs his help and thus, accompanied by his Land Sergeant Henry Dodd, Robert travels south to London.Hunsdon informs his son that he needs his peculiar skills as a detective. Robert's older brother is missing and a scandal is brewing that could cost Hunsdon more than just his job of security for her highness if the Queen becomes upset with the family. Robert is to find his sibling, a gambler, and bring him safely home. Unbeknownst to the detective and his companion Henry, the Vice Chancellor has set in motion a plan to use Robert and his brother to discredit their father in the eyes of Queen Elizabeth.A PLAGUE OF ANGELS, The fourth Carey Elizabethan mystery, is a fabulous investigative tale that employs real persona from the history books including the lead character. Appearances by literary figures such as Shakespeare and Marlowe add a feel of authenticity to the plot, but the story line belongs to Robert and his sleuthing, and the stunned, naive Henry, seeing the big city for the first time. Sub-genre fans will enjoy this novel and P.F. Chisholm's three other Carey books (A FAMINE OF HORSES, A SEASON OF KNIVES, and A SURFEIT OF GUNS).Harriet Klausner

$REVIEW.: I think this little book is a bit too complex for pre schoolers
It discusses a basically adult type of problem

It may be taken in and appreciated for the illustrations and the notion of "the best way to get around" and kind of perused by the munchkins


But don't ask Munchkins too many questions as the theme is too hard for them to follow

This one is for kids who love cars

Its not an environmental theme but shows different beautiful cars


For kids who just like cars, I guess.For Kids Who Love Cars - A Motor Picture Book

$review_text.: This book has been getting a lot of hype so I think that is why I wanted to read it.  Overall I did like it (kinda like a car crash you cannot look away from) but, it is one of the most violent biker "romance" I have ever read.  I would not consider it a romance at all.  It makes Ashley and Wylde's biker books tame by comparison.  (Tack and Horse are still my favorite Biker dudes)  This book is very realistic and gritty, maybe for me it was too realistic.  And I did not "feel" the connection between Brax and Winter.  A lot of the women are treated pretty bad too.  If you think that multiple scenes of violent torture would bother you  - I would suggest you skip this one!

It is an amusing book that answers the question, "why did 7 strangers let a woman they never met stay on in their house?" The answer, of course, is they were horny little men and Snow White wasn't so innocent. I know the editing wasn't always great but look past that. It really was an entertaining read.

$REVIEW.: `Path to Vengeance' is the first book in The Guardian series.  This is a sci-fi adventure that centers around an elite pilot, Grogaan, and his three friends.  Grogaan's greatest desire it to be accepted into his nation's pilot training program, so that he can join in protecting his planet from the relentless attacks of the Krelathans raiders.`Path to Vengeance' is a well-written story with a lot of aerial combat sequences.  Cann does a good job of developing the characters.  As a reader, you understand what motivates Grogaan, and why his friends are so loyal to him.  Some of the sections in the middle of the story got a little bogged down, but overall it flowed very well.  The story is a mixture of science fiction and fantasy.  I would recommend this book to readers who enjoy this genre.

$review_text.: Where do I even start with this review.  AMAZING!!!! WOW!!!  EDGE OF SEAT- GASPING FOR AIR AT TIMES GOOD!!  This book was recommended to me by an author friend.  I started it  and didn't go to bed til almost 5 a.m. when I was done.  I started reading it and was immediately intrigued by the characters.  I didn't have a clear vision of what this book was about going into it.  In the beginning, with all the mystery I briefly thought &#34;hes a vampire&#34; lol  but quickly realized I was pulling at strings.  This book took me on a journey that left me in the end gasping for air.  I didn't want it to be over.  Both characters are such bad a**es.  We have mystery, murder, romance, some moments that make you cringe, suspense, heartache, some butt kicking, some hot adult  scenes.  It had my tummy doing flips and twists.  I had anxiety.  Even when my eyes were telling me it was time to put it down.... I kept going.  It wasn't my NORM when it comes to books.  I am an MC whore and love my mommy porn.  So, when I tell you that this book just shot up to the top of my faves..... that is saying something.  Just when I thought I knew what was happening, I was wrong.  I am in love with Jay Lincoln!  He is a HOT ALPHA MYSTERIOUS TOTALLY KICK A** BAD A** that HAS A ROMANTIC SWEET SIDE.......  and Lily (bless her heart) has been through some shit with her ex.  She isn't the cry baby can't take care of herself girl either.  She herself is totally BAD A**!  Love them together......  You have to go one click this book!

$review_text.: First, Ms. Fleming has done it again. What an excellent book! Second, it&#8217;s going to kill me to write this review without giving away any spoilers. While I rarely award five stars, this book deserves it because I was totally captivated from the beginning to the end. The characters are wonderful, the writing is fantastic, there is humor as well as tragedy, and the action scenes are some of the best. There were times I couldn't have been more on the edge of my seat or read any faster!! Of course, I didn't like everything that happened in this book (at ALL!!), but that&#8217;s the nature of a zombie apocalypse, right? (sigh) While I can&#8217;t wait to get the next book, I&#8217;m almost a little afraid to read what happens next. I just finished this book last night, and some intense stuff went down so I&#8217;m still a bit traumatized. LOL Fortunately, since book three isn't due out until Fall/Winter, I&#8217;ll have some time to recover. Anyway, if you like zombie books with both brains AND heart, you really need to get this series. Just be sure to read them in the proper order. That&#8217;s important!

$REVIEW.: Teagan Ashe had always dreamed of taking over the family ranch one day.  Unfortunately, during her time in America becoming a champion barrel racer, her father did the unthinkable:  he sold the ranch and retired.  Now, feeling cut adrift, she has no desire to go back to Australia.  However, that might be just what she has to do.  Her visa is about to expire and her green card wedding has just been called off.  Enter the groom's best friend...Jamie MacCreadie has spent his life chasing something.  Scratching the proverbial itch before planning to settle down and help with his family's cattle ranch in Montana.  Now, after his best friend has dumped Teagan at the alter, he is faced with a tough choice:  step in and marry a woman he doesn't even like, or step away and make her mend her own fences while he mends his at home.This is the second book in the Copper Mountain Rodeo series and the first book to feature the MacCreadie family (Jamie's parents, Rob and Melinda, are featured in Rodeo Sweethearts; his aunt, Kate, is featured in Late Last Night).Teagan is fairly straight forward and &#34;salt of the earth&#34;.  She not only doesn't shy away from hard work, she expects to carry her own load.  Her anger at her father and resentment of her step-mother come out in some fairly ugly ways, but she is smart enough to keep those feelings under wraps, all things considered.  She misses Australia, but feels that there is nothing for her to go back to.Jamie is partially estranged from his own family.  He has never understood his parents' relationship; his mother is upbeat and scatter-brained (not ideal for a rancher's wife), while his father is hard working and quiet.  He also has a strained relationship with his older brother, RJ, who seems to resent his life style.I have to say this was not one of my favorite stories by Lilian Darcy.  She has a way of making chemistry come out of extraordinary circumstances.  It just didn't seem to work in this case.  I didn't really connect with Teagan, and I didn't find Jamie very heroic.That being said, I did enjoy the end of the book, which definitely made up for the lack of emotional response in the rest of the book.  The characters finally lived up to their promise at this point and made this book worth reading in the end.Overall, I would say buy the book, hang in there to the end, and you shouldn't be disappointed.

 I purchased the one by Rick & Gail Luttman first and find that book more useful


 The information in this one is okay and her style of writing is amusing and easy to read but I like the content in the one by the Luttman's better

 It was good in that it did address keeping a smaller flock where a lot of the other books I'd read catered toward large flocks


 While this wasn't a bad book and did have useful information I think I'll keep the other and pass this one to the local library.

$REVIEW.: Imagine God personally setup a meeting with you and during the meeting entrusted you with assets to manage. This is the basic principle behind The Treasure Principle. It is a short little book but is full of good perspective on what it means to be a money manager for God.Rather than thinking of your money and assets as yours, Alcorn discusses a different concept of God owning it all. When you think of money/possessions, not to mention many other assets such as time and talents, it changes the way you make financial decisions. By praying about purchases, saving, or giving away money, a person can gain insight into how God would like the assets used.Until a few years ago, I thought of myself as a relatively generous person but still thought of possessions and financial resources as my own. In changing to the perspective of being a steward of those assets, it really helps to keep in mind what is truly important and investing for eternal gain.I really like the discussion Alcorn covers in talking about spending temporary resources for eternal purposes. Anything that is owned here on earth will eventually be left behind so there is wisdom in seeking out the eternal purposes to invest in.For anyone wanting a quick read and a good Biblical perspective on being a financial steward of God, The Treasure Principle covers this nicely.

They both knew each other from high school and after Elaine is asked to tutor Jax in Geometry, Jax asked her out on a date which she is really happy about


The incident that happened after the date changed Elaine's life forever and that was her step dad Keith


After coming home from her date with Jax, Keith lays in to Elaine and beats her with a baseball bat and she ends up in hospital with Keith being arrested


She has to disappear after the incident so she has a new name and hides away in a new place as if Keith is released, he could come after her again

The story goes 10 years later and Elaine is still hiding away and Jaz has joined the police force

When Jax gets shot and as to go to a therapist, he can't believe his eyes when he recognizes Elaine is his therapist


Elaine finds out that Keith has been released so Jax and Elaine pack up and leave to hide out.It was a story that i enjoyed to read but i felt that the story could have had a bit more depth as i felt i didn't really understand or know enough about their pasts to really connect with the characters

I can see how the techniques work and am curious how I can implement them myself.My only criticism was that there was a bit of repetition and some things were not as explained as well as I would have liked, but I put the latter down to the fact that this was an `advanced' book marketing guide.Overall you can clearly see how the author succeeded in publishing, and there is enough evidence to support this

$REVIEW.: I was so into this book after reading the synopsis, and then the sample


It was such a great and unique idea to have hellhounds being people and not actual animal-like creatures


But it actually turned out to be completely ridiculous in every way
She is this normal person, but after one day of training she is suddenly great and badass

And on her first hunt she is eaten, but then cuts her way out and they are all amazed and she thinks she did something wrong even though they are all laughing and congratulating her...and it is all just so corny! And Lucifer is pretty out there, which I actually liked because it was pretty funny
But he is, for some reason, obsessed and in love with Halo (the main character) even though I really can't see anything desirable in her
It is clich&eacute;, and frankly slutty, that she insists on all her clothing being tight, black, stereotypical kinky sex-wear
And when she finally sleeps with the guy she is pining for, and then he leaves her, she is so clingy and pathetic! She has no self-respect (which would be acceptable, considering her past and the way she died)- but she tells herself she has changed and is all badass now- so for her to suddenly forget all that and beg for him to be with her and talk to her while she sobs, and sulks, and wallows in self-pity I just wanted to slap her! Get a grip! He definitely wont want to take you back if you act that way

And when she is so selfish as to leave alone with only one other person to go hunt when they know they are only supposed to go out in groups, her selfish actions and false confidence/ cocky attitude gets the person she was with tortured and killed- as well as herself killed!- suddenly her guy loves her enough to make a deal with Lucifer to go to Hell and sacrifice himself for her

Even though he hasn't talked to her in days and shows no interest in her whatsoever

SO STUPID! There is another book coming as this one's sequel, but I am in no way interested
I had to force myself through this one and I don't want anyone else to waste their time or money on this


I hate to say it, but it's garbage
I love reading, and I can overlook a lot of issues and mistakes, but this was just flat out crap.

$REVIEW.: I was delighted to find that Laurel Osterkamp wrote a follow-up novella to "Campaign Promises", where the character of Lucy Jones was first introduced. Lucy really matures in "November Surprise", and as Lucy's perspective grows less myopic, the other characters become more fleshed out for the reader. Monty's not the invincible god that Lucy first believed him to be, and Lucy realizes that she's not a passive participant in her own life. Although the author is obviously liberal, she does a nice job of including differing political views respectfully. I was happy that once again the politics were interwoven in a way that didn't overwhelm the rest of the story. I look forward to reading more from this author.

I was literally amazed that one man could get away with having two wives in the same city.It was sad to read about Tara's life and her not feeling loved by her father while Chaurisse was given everything. Tara's mother gave so much and was happy to recieve so little of James.  When the truth catches up with James and he must choose between the 2 women and girls, James chose Laverne and Chaurisse and turns his back on Tara and her mother.I really enjoyed this story and look forward to discussing it with my book club members.---EbonyReader4Life

$REVIEW.: I occasional check in to read the content over at The Minimalist

One of the writers there, Joshua Fields Millburn was offering his collection of short stories as a free Kindle download, so I figured why not


I will admit, I went in with kind of low expectation
I think there is a big difference between being a blogger and a writer of short stories or even longer fiction

Other items I have read by bloggers who tried to make the transition to long book form have fallen a bit flat

I will say I was pleasantly surprised! This collection includes short stories from the author as well a few other writers


All of the stories were engaging, and a few particularly touched me


I think there is a special talent in being able to craft a short story


Every sentence needs to hold value

I'll be keeping an eye out for future work by Fields Millburn.

$review_text.: I have heard of a lot of ways to lose weight, a lot of different diets and a lot of different tricks and techniques, but I never heard of actually fasting to lose weight. Actually it has been said to stay away from fasting when losing weight. The more you eat at smaller portions have been the most suggested technique lately to lose weight. To read this book and actually learn something different from the everyday rules and tricks you hear was refreshing. I love the explanation of this book on how fasting can be used to lose weight. With the stick figure illustrations of this book it helps us visual people see how it actually works. Great information and I will be giving this technique a try.

$REVIEW.: I love short stories, but now I'm not too sure I'm a fan of short romance. Nisha the Heartless was an intriguing character- or she could have been, had more been there. More back story. What earned her that nickname? How long has she been a mercenary, transporting items for a price. And what, in the post-apocalyptic world, are jewels useful for? What do they buy? Are gems more plentiful, thus becoming money?I could see her breaking all the rules for someone she's laid eyes on for about three seconds. It happens in romance books and movies all the time, and is well-used "love at first sight" ploy. But I couldn't bring myself to see this woman who was supposedly tough as nails falling head over heels for Drakor and turning gooey in a matter of a few paragraphs.I loved the idea of Nisha the Heartless, Drakor, and all the Strange. I loved the idea of this very unique post-apocalyptic environment. I didn't love it as a short story. It had great promise to at least stretch to a novella to develop the characters. Had the author gone a step further and turned this into a novel, it might have become my new favorite book.

$review_text.: Setting this original graphic novel in the period between the novels Fool Moon and Grave Peril (books two and three of The Dresden Files) gives Butcher and his co-creators the ability to show us a younger, somewhat less-grizzled but still not completely naive Harry Dresden, as well as the chance to tell a story not weighed down by the heavy goings on of the most recent books in the series

As with the Dresden Files RPG, setting the story early in the series run reduces the risk of spoiling major events for anyone for whom this might be a first exposure to the characters
The other aspect of this story that helps reduce potential spoilerage is the fact that other than Harry, none of the main Dresden Files characters make more than a cursory appearance
If Murphy and Thomas and the Carpenters aren't around for Harry to talk to, dialogue can hardly spoil, or hint at, events to come
 That being said, if you're concerned about spoilers: read this after you've read Fool Moon, because a good part of that novel is spoiled in flashback; it's an important flashback in that it sets Harry's tone for part of this adventure, so it could hardly be left out / go unexplained.There's solid character work and world-building here, as there always is in a Dresdenverse story


I suspect at this point Jim's time is enough at a premium that he's not going to spend time writing (or even just outlining) a story that doesn't expand Harry's world or world-view in some way

This time out, even though the story is set in a small town in Missouri, we get a look at some supernatural entities that we haven't seen or had hinted at in the novels so far; Harry of course is not fazed at all by the presence of these entities -- he knows about them, even if we as readers don't -- and his narration tells us as much as we need to know to understand their roles in the greater Dresdenverse.The plot itself is pretty standard early Dresden: Harry is asked by a slightly skeptical human to investigate a crime that might be supernatural in nature; the slightly skeptical human is quickly convinced but Harry gets backlash from a completely non-believing human; Harry thinks he understands what's going on, thinks he has a solution; Harry then finds out he was wrong on one or both of the previous counts and has to improvise to conclude the case without further loss of life and copious amounts of property damage
 Along the way, Harry earns the ire/respect of various heretofore-unknown supernatural players in the drama


 It's formulaic, but in this case it works, and the supporting human characters give Harry plenty to play off of

 The one aspect of this book that doesn't fit the formula is the prologue, in which we the readers learn information that Harry cannot possibly know until someone tells him
A nice little tweak that we don't get in the novels.The artwork is a bit cartoonier than I think the previous original graphic novel, Welcome To The Jungle, was, but it fit the story very well


Particularly in the way he drew Pres, the artist reminded me of the great Dan Spiegle, who drew the run of Blackhawk in the 80s that I loved so much.

$REVIEW.: I got the book yesterday and I'm already knitting the stacked wedge pattern on page 92.  I like this book for a couple of reasons.1.  I'm not an expert quilter. I'm more the adventurous beginner.  I didn't know how to do a "short row". Lynne's directions and pictures are great so now I do know how to do a short row.  Hiding the wraps directions was also very clear. Great photos.2. The patterns are a bit edgey without being over the top.  You know great for people who walk on the sidewalk and not the catwalk :)3. The structure of the scarves is quirky and interesting without being ridiculous.4. The techniques section in the back is very clear.Very happy with this book :)

Countdown City was well written, fast pace, exciting, and full of action


I'm excited to get my hands on book one and also continue on with this trilogy- worth the read

First for Jade Jax who lost her husband and first love Donovan during a mission he was on
Then for Max who was wounded during mission to bring down the Delfuego Cartel and rescue Darcy Mackenzie and the joining of two souls with so much in commom

$REVIEW.: My review involves both books in the series: Finding You & Finding Me

I liked the males in the story: Logan, Angel & Tate, the heroine, Neva, got on my nerves


I understand she had PTSD (I have a background in psychology) but Neva seemed to have a meltdown every 10 pages
The sobbing and knee buckling occurred so often I found myself skipping ahead

Some aspects of the plot, particularly as they pertain to Angel's father (don't want to be more specific to spoil it for readers) seemed really implausible

I also didn't think Angel's betrayal seemed plausible, if the relationship between Angel and his father were more fully developed, it would have seemed more realistic
To be honest, it was also hard for me to get why she was with Angel, maybe because the author spent less time developing their relationship, I just  didn't quite get why they had any chemistry between them

Also, I know they were in college but where is the romance, nice sex scenes but very little romance
I probably won't get any more books in the series.

I downloaded all of the Surviving the Zombie Apocalypse books then had to look up which book to read first, second, etc. So kudos for that! I enjoyed a different take on a tired subject. I liked that the writers were English and wrote from that prospective, instead of trying(and failing) to act like someone from the USA.The book was exciting, lots of zombie killing, differing opinions on what needed to be done, and some character development. I would have enjoyed more of a backstory so that I didn't feel I started a series with the wrong book.I will purchase and read the next of the series.

$REVIEW.: Baby, It's Cold Outside is a wonderful story set in the town of Frost, Minnesota during the post-WWII era. At a time when the country is healing from the hardships and heartache of war, five people, some strangers... some old acquaintances, are forced to take shelter together in a 'storm house'. This is where the real healing begins.There are some great lessons in this story. Dottie and Gordy have lost many years to unforgiveness toward each other... and themselves. Stubborness that keeps them from turning to God after the loss of Dottie's son keeps them both in pain, unable to receive healing. Violet and Jake have been damaged by the views of others... allowing them to determine their worth. Only now, after being forced together by a huge blizzard, are they each learning to receive healing... though not looking for healing themselves, yet receiving it still... in the healing they offer to one another.Even though I didn't live during this time period, Susan May Warren painted a picture so vivid that it felt like I had. A heartwarming read with characters so real in their description that you would think they actually lived. I found myself longing for the comforts of Dottie's home and the simplicity of the day, and I felt the hopes and heartaches of the characters.A wonderful book, great for the holidays or any day. It will quickly become a favorite.*Litfuse Publicity Group has provided me with a complimentary copy of this book for my honest review. ~ Thanks!

$REVIEW.: This book is an account of a little known raid conducted very early in the Second World War using "borrowed" (stolen?) B-25 bombers.  It is an oral account from one of the participants, Vernon Main, edited and written by Richard Bienvenu.  The story is well-told and gives a very good picture of how desperate things were in those early days in the Pacific and also of the the improvisation skills and "can-do" attitude of those who were there.  My only disappointment with the story was that it just wasn't long enough.  I really wanted to read more of their missions and exploits, but unfortunately they weren't there.

$REVIEW.: William Tenn is often referred to as a satirist, and his "satire" is of the socially observant and subversive stripe


Tenn certainly poked and prodded at human weaknesses and political hypocrisy in his classic short stories

Meanwhile, in a fashion that reminds me of another under-appreciated sci-fi genius, Alfred Bester, Tenn also built stories around the contradictions and credibility gaps in stock sci-fi archetypes
Have you ever wondered why sci-fi aliens look human and speak English? Wouldn't aliens be so different from humans that they would find us bizarre and disgusting? When characters travel through time do they alter history, and if they do, does anyone notice? Or how could all humans possibly unite against an alien menace without breaking down into factions? In Tenn's often expertly considered and intricately plotted tales, he explored these contradictions, and constructed fascinating stories that every science fiction historian should know better.Granted, there are some clunkers in Tenn's body of work, in which he fell into the satirist's trap of creating an improbable fictional universe which would then be used for thin statements about social problems

Some examples here include "The Masculinist Revolt" and "Venus is a Man's World," which merely switch gender domination roles to comment on sexism
Some of Tenn's non-satirical stories such as "The Ghost Standard" and "The Tenants" are held back by quaint explorations of human nature that aren't too illuminating


But these problems are rare in Tenn's repertoire
His winning satires truly bring the weaknesses of sci-fi writing, and humanity, into broad focus, and he was amazingly ahead of his time in some of his political explorations
(Most of the stories here were written for the golden age mags in the 40s and 50s.)The look at human cruelty and celebrity is truly astonishing in this collection's most insightful story, "Time in Advance," in which criminals have the option to serve their time before committing the crime
Other winning stories explore how humanity doesn't have the inherent strengths to reach for the stars or rise above infighting &#8211; including the outstanding "Alexander the Bait," "The Servant Problem," "Project Hush," and several others


Meanwhile, Tenn comes up with absolutely fascinating subversions of sci-fi archetypes, like time travel in "Winthrop Was Stubborn" and "Lisbon Cubed," and the troublesome relations between closed-minded humans and extremely non-human aliens in "The Flat-Eyed Monster," "Venus and the Seven Sexes," and "The Last Bounce," among others


The contrarian and thought-provoking nature of Tenn's works may explain why he's not better known to modern sci-fi fans
Deep-thinking readers can consider the injustice of that while wrapping their minds around Tenn's very sharp and pointed works

$REVIEW.: Nathan Lowell seems to have many fans and has won a pot full of awards, so I find it a little puzzling that I just can't see what the fuss is about.  Yes, he writes clearly, and life aboard his "solar clippers" is quite believable in its mundaneness.  But he also gets bogged down in the minutiae of shopping, cooking, clothing, and test-taking and seems more than satisfied to paint travelling through the universe as though he were imagining a drive through the Midwest on Route 80.  There is no variation in his planets, starports, flora, fauna, and no alien intelligences at all!In Double Share, Ishmael Wang has finished the Academy that was his prize at the end of Full Share, and after a journey in a "fast packet", he arrives at the port where he must board his freight hauler, the "Billy" as Third Mate.  Once again, he finds instant success (really, coffee?) but runs into his first serious problem.  With the universe and all of the future at his disposal, Mr. Lowell chooses to find his drama in the issue of sexual harassment on board the ship.  Well, at least there are some bad guys, at last.I had complained in a review of Half Share that nothing dramatic ever happened in this series, and threatened to stop after Full Share if it didn't improve.  Shame on me.  I fell for it again because the Kindle price was (just) low enough to hit my buy impulse.  If I buy another of these, please come and take away my Kindle.

I feel completely satisfied


I have been reading too many books that don't have a complete ending and you have to wait for the 2nd book


I'm so tired of that

Raven and Jonah's characters made this book sexy and you felt the love between them


Oh my God, Blake!! Loved his character and cannot wait for the 2nd book on him.

$REVIEW.: Best one of the series so far. I had been looking forward to Liam's story and I was not disappointed. It was a bit frustrating that it took so long to find Rosalind, and I would have liked seeing more of the other Kellington siblings, but the romance made up for that. One of the things that I really liked was that this couple didn't waste half the book trying to pretend that they don't really love each other. Once Liam found Rosalind and told her that he loved her, and convinced her that he wasn't helping her out of duty or responsibility because she was a family friend, they had a really sweet, but also passionate romance. The conflict in the story came from outside characters, and I personally like it better that way. Who wants to read 200 pages of a couple denying their feelings when all kinds of more interesting things could be happening? This was a very enjoyable read and 5 stars on a historical romance does not come easily from me ( I'm a PR fan), so draw your own conclusions on that.

$review_text.: I bought this book for my dad to fill out and add pictures to the back so that I can learn more about him and also my children, their children and so on


Then i came up with an awesome idea to have everyone fill this book out and add loose pictures throughout their lives to the back so they can all be passed down from generation to generation! I think its a great idea because I for one am curious about my past family but i am not close to my moms side in the slightest so i dont know anything

Im excited to get 23 more to pass them out

$review_text.: First off, I'm not vegan, but I like having different and varied vegetable and grain options and I find many of those in vegetarian and vegan cookbooks

The Spinach, Lentil, and Quinoa Stew recipe in this book is fantastic! I used packaged steamed lentils and red quinoa and I non-veganed it by using chicken stock instead of the water
Since I planned to use this as a side dish, I reduced the liquid a bit by simmering the sauteed veggies in it
I chopped the spinach, covered the pot, and turned off the heat so the spinach wilted but remained bright green


The dish was beautiful and it was delicious!

Frost is determined to work with Dunn Dunn inspite of Ivory saying that Dunn Dunn killed Hernandez but when Tweety gets word she's determined to meet Dunn Dunn to show just what she's made of. Watch how this all unfolds. You will never guess. This is not a predictable novel. Excellent novel. I loved the unpredictable drama. I only put it down when I was done.

$review_text.: It's the morning of September 12, 2001, and President George W


Bush is sitting at his desk, alone in the Oval Office

 The door opens and in walks Osama Bin Laden


 The intruder begins to pull his outer garment back and move his hand towards his hip
 President Bush quickly produces a revolver from his desk and fires three times into the torso of his intruder, mortally wounding him.As hard as it may seem to believe that imaginary event, something quite similar  -- and just as hard to believe actually happened in Fort Worth, Texas, in July 1926


 J
Frank Norris was as well known nationally then as Jimmy Swaggart and T.D Jakes are today

 His loyal and somewhat rabid flock has been referred to as "Baptists on steroids."  Norris had himself been a loyal and rabid fan of William Jennings Bryan, followed the Scopes Trial closely, and  was quickly gaining a national following of fundamentalist believers.The "hip pocket move" and the doctrine of "apparent danger", taken together, were a legal and accepted defense in the Wild West Days of Fort Worth, Texas

 Fort Worth, in the roaring twenties, was still considered in many ways, to be enjoying the "wild west" ways of days gone by

 It was certainly true of their legal system


 To that synergistic mix, add Fort Worth's eleventh commandment, "Thou Shalt Not Mess With J

Frank Norris" and it's easy to see how a local pastor with a national celebrity similar to that enjoyed in later years by Michael Jackson or O.J


Simpson could be found guilty in the court of public opinion and acquitted by a jury of his peers.An old adage in the newspaper business was "Never let the truth interfere with a good story."  David Stokes, author of The Shooting Salvationist did not heed that advice, nor did he need to
 Another served his needs even better: "The truth is stranger than fiction."  With over six thousand pages of notes and twenty years of research, Stokes needed only to assemble the facts and connect the dots
 He did an admirable job and readers will be turning pages from one chapter to the next, often with an irresistible cliff-hanger to lead them on
 Stokes also takes advantage of previously written articles, quotes, and notes from private conversations so that little speculation is left as to who said what and when they said it

 Written in a style that seems like fiction and in the voice of an all-knowing narrator, Stokes charms us with the story-telling skills of a Southern Baptist minister

 The author's vocation as both a minister and a radio personality begs the comparison with his subject, "It takes one to know one," and he addresses that convincingly by injecting his own opinions about his subject


 He sees Norris as an opportunistic showman who used the pulpit as his vehicle, just the opposite of how Norris's fans viewed him.Fort Worth's power elite, the "top dogs of the city" met daily at the opulent Fort Worth Club

 In July 1926, Mayor H.C

Meacham chaired a "closed door off the record" meeting with more than thirty of the club's most influential members


The subject? What could or should they do about the city's J
Frank Norris problem


 They felt the out-of-control preacher was doing great harm to their city
Norris would later refer to this as a deep laid conspiracy


 One of the attendees was a big and tall man named D.E

Chipps, who with Norris, had a mutual appointment with destiny.The first half of The Shooting Salvationist details the history and rise to power of J
Frank Norris and how he not only became the pastor of Fort Worth's First Baptist Church, but how he used newspaper and radio to become nationally known as "the pastor of America's first megachurch"


 Norris was an eloquent and persuasive speaker and used his talent to grow the church from several hundred to almost eight thousand loyal fanatics in just a few years

With contacts such as William Jennings Bryan, FDR,  and leading pastors in major cities like New York, J
Frank was building a foundation for himself to become the national leader of the fundamentalist movement at a time when evolution and prohibition dominated the social and political news
 And then, D
E

Chipps walked into Norris office and the remainder of the book deals with the Texas murder trial of the decade.F

Lee Bailey is credited with saying something like, "After the first trial, the matter of guilt or innocence is no longer important."  For Norris, the first trial was in the media and public opinion


 Meacham hired a team of crack defense lawyers to help with the prosecution
 That's right, help for the district attorney


 Can you imagine Bailey, Cochran, et al helping prosecute O.J
Simpson? Norris's flock, both local and national pitched in and hired him a dream team of former prosecutors to help with the defense
It gets curiouser and curiouser!  Which leads us to the basis of Norris's defense, the doctrine of "Apparent Danger": "You can believe your life is in danger by reason of actions of an adversary and kill him, only to discover afterward you were laboring under a misapprehension; yet the homicide you have committed is justified in the eyes of the law."Here are the back stories, connections with famous people, and their stories
 The names read like a Jazz Age who's who, from Byron Nelson and Bobby Jones to John Birch, Claire Chennault, Will Rogers, William Randolph Hearst, President Truman, and even Pope Pius XII
 The Missouri Bible College has roots to Norris' career


 On the day Norris died in 1952, one of the new students that started that day was Jerry Falwell


 With well documented information, including sixteen pages of black and white photos, Stokes entertains, informs, and challenges us with unforgettable truths about man and God and law.Eighty years ago this July, the J
Frank Norris story captured the attention of the nation for months


It dominated the news


 Anyone who paid attention to radio or newspapers knew the name J
Frank Norris
 Some thought him a showman hero while others called him a charlatan and a nuisance


No one was neutral.

$REVIEW.: It has been a really long time since a story grabbed me from the her first page. Life's Perfect Plan had my attention the minute I started it. I immediately connected to the characters.  I didn't know that it would shatter my heart into teeny, tiny pieces. However, at the end, my heart was put back together, piece by piece and more.Elizabeth and Grant are college sweethearts that have been trying to have a baby for a long time. After awhile it consumes their marriage. Grant wants their marriage to return to the way it was before trying to have baby. They agree to one more try, then resume to life as normal without the extra help of getting pregnant. However, life has a completely different plan. When Beth suffers a devastating loss, she finds out that there is something else in store for her.What if your life was turned completely upside down? What if you have love ripped out from under you without notice? I do not want to get into to much detail.  Giving away the story will be a disservice as this writer allows you to LIVE and experience the book.The loss experienced in the book tore my heart out. I think I screamed at my kindle, and messaged the author. I was devastated. How is she going to make this right? How am I going to go on? As I continue to read, Sarah Goodman more than delivered. My heart did little flip flops as I read. I cried. I laughed.  I swooned (ALOT). I cried some more. This is so much more than your average love story. SO much more. Not sure if I can properly put into words how affected I was by this book. This highly emotional, all consuming story left me on a book high. You go through pain and sorrow. You feel every emotion that Beth goes through in what life throws at her so suddenly. I loved Beth and how strong she was. She took what life handed her and ran with it.The writing style was seamless. It flowed nicely and was kept at an enjoyable pace the entire time. Life's Perfect Plan makes you believe in life and hope. In fate. That love conquers all. Love endures all. When life does not go as planned, it is because something bigger that is beyond you is planned. This beautiful story captivated me from beginning to end.  I recommend this story to anyone that wants to experience a highly emotional, thought provoking, well written, romance story.
$SUMMARY.: Beautiful and will leave you speechless at times

$review_text.: Nimira is a trouser girl. She left her home years ago seeking fame and maybe even fortune in Lorinar.Instead Nim is treated like foreign trash and reduced to playing in seedy music halls lacking the respect and admiration reserved for artists back home in Tiansher.That is until a sorcerer comes to Nim with an unusual proposal.Hollin Parry is in possession of an automaton of singular craftsmanship. It plays the piano and some people say it might be haunted, so real does it look. Mr. Parry doesn't believe any of that, but he would like a singer to accompany the automaton's playing. In fact, he wants Nimira to accompany it.If Nimira can ignore the rumors about the automaton and the sorcerer's past, Mr. Parry can offer her respectable work at the fine estate of Vestenveld, a steady income, and maybe even something more if Nim is willing.But life at Vestenveld is not as it appears. A madwoman roams the halls and rooms are filled with remnants of a dark past. Then there's the automaton.He doesn't frighten Nimira, far from it. But what if his lifelike movements aren't just clockwork actions? What if the automaton really is haunted? Or worse? As Nim learns more about her new home and the automaton she will have to make dangerous choices to protect herself and save the one she loves in Magic Under Glass (2010) by Jaclyn Dolamore.At 225 pages (hardcover) Magic Under Glass is a short book--especially for a fantasy (a genre where many books top out at more than 400 pages). Dolamore's pacing is perfect to build tension and establish the complicated world of Lorinar, especially as seen through the eyes of a foreigner like Nim, right until the end of the story.Like the Libba Bray's Gemma Doyle books, this one blends a lot of different elements into what is essentially a fantasy. Magic Under Glass offers commentary on racism, discrimination, class systems, ethics and more all while guiding Nimira through a story narrated, rather delightfully, in Nim's witty voice. The novel also blends elements of gothic novels with traditional fantasy tropes (and politics) to create suspense and romance throughout.The ending comes very quickly as the story builds to a high action scene that culminates rather abruptly. Even with the quick ending Magic Under Glass is really a perfect story. And, honestly, a perfect ending. The story's closure is just open-ended enough for readers to imagine their own perfect outcome. A sequel may be in the works--Dolamore has certainly created a large enough world to accommodate many more stories--but this is one book that is wrapped up very nicely on its own without tying things up too tightly.Possible Pairings: A Great and Terrible Beauty by Libba Bray, Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte, Graceling by Kristin Cashore, Beautiful Creatures by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl, Fire and Hemlock by Diana Wynne Jones, The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick, Selling Hope by Kristin O'Donnell TubbVisit my blog for Exclusive Bonus content about the book's different cover designs.

$REVIEW.: If you like to make quilts that look like pictures, this will be a book of interest to you.  I would rather make a quilt that is useable rather than one that is just to look at.Ms. Hughes writes 27 pages on the types of embellishments you can use and how to apply each of them to the quilt.  The patterns each have a blurb, two materials list --- one for fabric and one for embellishments and the cutting list is included.  Templates are included but need to be enlarged.The written instructions are more written than included graphics although there are a few.  Hints and tips are given throughout the book and set off in colored boxes within a frame.  Two galleries of finished items include one of the author's and one that is called guest artist's gallery.This is not a book I would buy for myself but I do know an artist who paints and quilts and I'm betting she will like it.

$REVIEW.: This book was given to me in a contest. I was looking for something good to read and this literally landed in my lap. I am so glad it did. Emotional, raw, sexy, frustrating and oh so good. I loved it. Ford was a total butt but lovable because he has his own issues. He never sugar coats anything, no matter what. He says how he feels and that's his way. I loved Ash. She gave Ford just as much as he gave her.It's such a different story than I am used to. Ford is dealing with the loss of someone special and so is Ash. They come together in a situation that is not ideal. Ford learns he can have emotions and Ash learns to trust, something both of them have problems with. They work together and in the end Ford gets his HEA.Its a great story and you can't give much of the plot away without revealing the story. You must read this book!!!

$REVIEW.: I have never previously read anything by this author, and I bought the book for $.99, so my expectations were not high. I am glad to say that the book not only exceeded those limited expectations, but it was so good that I will be looking for more by this author.  The suspense was well-crafted, with frequent unexpected turns and twists. I was delighted to find that Mr. Hankins can write, and does so rather well, in spite of a few unfortunately all-to-common uses of the conditional perfect instead of the past perfect, i.e., using "would have" when "had" would have been correct. In this day sadly, one must become used to that kind of rather sloppy writing (and speech). That said, it was not enough to detract from the otherwise very compelling story, or the comprehensive character development. If you like thrillers, especially those with a somewhat unusual theme, and don't have an aversion to reading, briefly but more than once, about torture, then I highly recommend this good and interesting example of the genre. I read deep into the night to finish the book, and then was rather sorry that I had come to the end - always the sign of an enthralling book, in my mind.

$review_text.: I bought this book from Amazon for free because I wanted to review it for the author, Willow Cross.I read this book in less than a day and I loved it! It's a quick, engaging book that will hook every reader of fantasy. I loved the story because it's very original and the fact that it's kind of dystopia. The story is also very engaging. The fast pace will not let you put the book down.The characters make the book even better. I adored Remy.Her characters is very good created and you can't not love her. She's strong, smart,  determined  and she loves her siblings very much. I liked the relationship between Remy and her brothers, Greg and Shane. Shane is lovely, a very smart and adorable girl.Greg is the kind of guy who wants to seem a badass but he is sensitive.Willow Cross is a master in writing fighting scenes. Usually, I am not a huge fan of fighting scenes, but I liked this kind of scenes in this book.I can't wait to read the second book. I hope I can finish it today since is very short and quick (I read like 10% in less than half an hour). I really loved this book!We are in 2015-the world is dominated of demons. But there are still humans, with their own minds,  still uninfected by the demons, are trying to fight them and bring the world to a new light and peace. People like Remy and her family.Remy was trained to fight the demons, as well as her brother and her sister. But the demons are stronger than they thought, and their war is very hard. But Remy is more determinated than everyone. After her mother was possesed by a demon and Remy killed her so she could be saved.Remy and her brother make a crazy plan to destroy the demons. They venture in the world of dark and unknow. Will their plan work? Will they destroy the demons? Read the book and find out!I recommend this book if you are searching for an easy, fun reading.

$review_text.: Seth Harwood took me on a journey through the Projects of Boston in the 1980s. He created a incredibly realistic experience, with multidimensional characters and multiple points of view. I couldn't help but keep reading -- I sat up all night at the edge of my seat reading this book.  I think it is, perhaps, Seth Harwood's best work yet.It is definitely worth the read.

$REVIEW.: This book has a good plot, in that I give it an 'E' for effort, it was just not executed properly.  This read more like someone having an 'idea' for a story, writing it out to get the idea out there, but it was never worked on or finished.  The story has a good premise and has lots of potential, but it's completely unrealistic even for a fiction book, the things that happened, when and how didn't mesh well together to even seem believable.  I loved that the main character was a plus sized woman with loads of self esteem and never made being plus sized an issue.  That was the best part about the book, but the story as a whole just didn't mesh together.  To many unbelievable and shouldn't even be there circumstances, the conversations and dialogue was completely off.  Not to mention the constant name dropping, if more time had been spent on character and storyline development, this would probably have been a better more realistic story.  I believe the author has potential, they have the talent but they just need to learn how to execute the story line.

$review_text.: I just finished this book and immediately purchased the second.  The plot was a bit over the top, but that didn't keep me from reading all night.  It was a fun, sexy, and suspenseful.  Is it great literature, no.  But if your looking for a fun and racy summer read, it will do the job.  It is clearly the first in a series as the end leaves you wondering.  However it is a complete story.  A few times I've downloaded "the first in a series"  and was very disappointed to realize it wasn't the first in a series, but rather a potion of a book, not the case with Under Construction. I am happy to have found a new indie author I enjoy.

$review_text.: COMEBACK by Peter CorrisThis is the second novel by Corris that I have read and it reads just as we'll and smoothly as did my first, namely THE DUNBAR CASE.  This title, also featuring rugged Australian PI Cliff Hardy also happens to be an ex-cop with plenty of friends also has plenty of enemies, noticeably on both sides of the law.  In COMEBACK, Hardy is hired to track down and &#34;remove&#34; an apparent stalker from the life of an up and coming young Australian television personality.  Less than a week into the job, said client is found dead in his car on his way to a quick round of golf and before we can say &#34;whodunit&#34; our man Cliff is the number one suspect in the eyes of the law.  Well of course WE all know he did not do it but one death leads to a funeral which leads to a grieving father which leads to another investigation which leads to another murder which leads to ... You get the idea.Anyway COMEBACK is a tightly written explosive detective story featuring our man Cliff, some thugs, some more thugs, some coppers and some more thugs.  Characters come and go and come again and we never are sure who they really are, but that can be attributed to the skill and talent of the writer who as we all know by now is world class.  This book is around 100 pages longer than DUNBAR CASE and the story line is a little bit more complex.  Consequently it is a better read overall.  So in summary COMEBACK is another world class writing performance from Peter Coriss. Can't wait for the next one!Greggorio (LR)

$REVIEW.: an excellent use of deja vu as a device, i enjoyed reading this novella.  at first reading i was annoyed by the repetitive nature of some of the text but as i made it to the end of the story i completely appreciated it.  it was very necessary and spoke to the excellent writing style of the author.  the subtle but significant changes to the text made me feel for all of the characters...it really drew me closer to trevor.this may come off as elitist but if you're a 'true reader' you get what the author is doing and you appreciate the subtle nuances and the changes made.  the exchanges in the garage?  fan-freakin'-tastic as peggy hill might say.  made me giggle aloud upon each reading.  the 'something is not quite right' feeling - heck, that even grew in the pit of my OWN stomach while reading - keep me swiping the screen, eager to find out what happens next.  (nice work of foreshadowing)  as another reviewer wrote, pull out the tissues and hankies toward the end.i purchased this as a birthday gift to myself and am quite pleased.

$REVIEW.: This is the novella starring the beautiful Miss Amelia Snowe, the mean child in The Ugly Duckling series.Although she was mean and hateful (we really did dislike her) in the previous three books in the series, she finally gets to have her own HEA and hero.And we get to see how she came to be the way she is and can begin to reform our thoughts about her in this little novella.Okay so her Miss Amelia Snowe's mother has passed and she is now destitute and penniless, but with the help of her newly found friends the former Ugly Duckling cousins, she has found a job as a companion to a girl from a middle class family. The parents then planned a house party to find their daughter a suitable husband and during this time Amelia is reacquainted with her childhood sweet heart, Lord Quentin Fortescue.But she can't risk her position as a companion to the girl whom she's watching because where else could she go. She'll just have to stay away from the tempting man and let him go on his way.Quentin was surprise to see his former love working as a companion to a family lower than her social upbringing let alone in more controlled of herself and duller than he remember. The last he had seen of her was when she rejected his suit of becoming his wife years ago and leaving him heart broken to pursuit titled gentlemen in London. Now a widow, he thought he has gotten over his feelings towards the high headiness of a girl he fell for but can't help but fall back into her gaze and wonder what had happen to the girl he once new and loved.This was an amazing read as I sit here at six in the morning typing this review. I love the series and am super delight and happy that Ms. Collins had written this story for Amelia and had given her her own HEA. We got to see her in the last book of the series in How to Entice an Earl quite a bit and got to see her break down due to the fact that none of the wealthy titled gentlemen wanted her but fell for the cousin whom she loved the bully. I just love that this novella helped reformed her in our, the readers' eyes and can come to love her as much as we once hated her.In this story Amelia was portrayed as the toned down girl whom she used to be and had fallen in hard times with her mother's death. We also find out that the reason why she was so persistent in finding a suitable and wealthy gentlemen was due to the fact that she wand her mother was living on loans and basically nothing but pride. I love how realistic Amelia's feelings were towards those she had wronged and how she felt that everything that was happening to her because of her actions in the past. I really admire her strength and courage on holding her head high and learning her position as a fallen beauty and on doing the right thing for a good cause, and for not look down on people because of their status anymore. It was an eye opener for her which was great.Quentin I adore! He keep to himself and stayed true to himself. He was witty and open with Amelia and their past history and was willing to work it out and put it past him just to get closer and have that bond they used to have years ago. I like how he wasn't pushy to get Amelia to open up about her thoughts but listened and waited for her responses, along with poking her with small questions at first then letting her open up to more info when she wanted to.This was a very sweet, fast, touching story of forgiveness, reformation, second chances, and learning to trust and love one another. I really enjoyed this read and can't believe this series it truly over~ But I cannot wait for the next trilogy series which stars a certain characters we just met in this story :D So look out for Why Dukes Say I Do book one in the Wicked Widows trilogies coming the end of July 2013!!!Hope you readers enjoy this delightful little read :)This ARebook was provided by netgallery and St. Martin's Paperbacks.

$REVIEW.: I love Christine Bell's writing, she has a wonderfully captivating voice that puts you right in the middle of her stories. In Dirty Trick, Bell weaves a story of best friends turned lovers through a sexy Halloween trick that turns into the most delicious of treats.Grace Love is a match maker, however, her skills haven't worked so well for herself. After a devastating breakup that shattered her self esteem, she has stuck to the safe...and somewhat boring. The only man who seems to make her tingle is her playboy best friend and neighbor, Trick Matthews, but she knows messing around with him will only lead to another broken heart.Trick has been lusting after his neighbor since the first day she moved in, but when Grace quickly friend-zoned him, he took the hint. Hanging out with her day after day though has only strengthened his initial attraction for Grace until he can no longer picture his life without her and wants more then just friendship. Trick knows that Grace will never give him the chance to show her how right they are together. But when an opportunity arises at Halloween to show her just how good they can be together without her even knowing it is him, he takes it. The trouble is, once the lies start Trick finds it hard to dig himself out of the pile he makes until he risks loosing any chance with Grace, as a friend and lover.I enjoyed Dirty Trick start to finish. Grace is a fun, feisty, and relate-able heroine. I understood her hesitance in even thinking about more then just friendship with Trick. Don't get me wrong, I wanted to shake her occasionally for her inability to see what was right in front of her. Uber hot and sweet SWAT guy who was head over heels in love with her. But, I got it. Trick made me melt right from the get-go. Did you miss the part about uber hot SWAT guy? *melts again* This was a man that was just trying to find a way to be with the woman he loved and took an opportunity that landed in his lap to make it happen. Does that make his deceitfulness okay? I'll let you decide. I'll tell you one thing though, Trick's road to redemption was a heartrendingly good ride! And did I mention the sultry and inventive love scenes? Have a glass of ice ready ladies!If you love contemporary romance with a little hot trickery involved I recommend you picking up Dirty Trick for a quick and satisfying read perfect for the fall season!***A copy of this book was received in exchange for an honest review. No monies or compensation was exchanged.

$review_text.: This might have been several books - one on the educational system in the US, one on the Milgram/Zimbardo experiments, one on Abu Ghraib and on the Holocaust, one on social psychology and one on the ethics of Maimonides and Spinoza and finally yet another one on brain science. But it isn't. In an effort to develop a sustained argument, Heidi M. Ravven, professor of religious studies at Hamilton College, aims at incorporating these themes in a grand synthesis. How convincing this endeavour comes across is perhaps dependent on your own background and point of view. In any case the book is bound to raise considerable controversy.The first parts seem fairly straightforward. An historical overview of the US educational system with its stress on individual responsibility following Kant and Rawls and a discussion of the lessons to be learned from the Holocaust and the dangers of groupthink leads up to chapter four. Here the going gets tough. Ravven defends a form of determinism and denial of free will as articulated by 17th century Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza. Many philosophers consider the problem of free will to be the thorniest of all. For starters, the shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy states that more than 200 senses of the word "free" have been distinguished (p.287).In a discussion on Descartes, Ravven proposes that the French philosopher leans heavily on St. Augustine, calling him an Augustinian revivalist and theologically conservative, "perhaps even reactionary". She goes so far as to state that Descartes's voluntarism outstrips even Augustine's own (p. 178). Citing the work of historian of philosophy Stephen Menn she comes to the conclusion that "Descartes's conscious intention (was) to develop a philosophy in an Augustinian key" to meet the demands of the Counter-Reformation. (p. 175). She also sees as a sign of his religious, rather than philosophical intentions the fact that he offered his work to theologians for approval. By this she probably means Nicholas Malebranche and the famous Porte-Royal school of Antoine Arnauld. But according to another scholar this was "indicative of no intellectual affinity" (Henri Gouhier, A Companion to Descartes, Blackwell, p. 35). Gouhier is also of a different opinion concerning Descartes's deep indebtedness to Augustine. Professor of philosophy at the city university of New York Catherine Wilson, states that in his old age Augustine, in contrast with Descartes, rejected philosophy in favour of faith. In her opinion Descartes's Augustinian metaphysics complemented rather than supported the scientific image of the world. "It substituted monotheism for the atheism and nature-worship associated with the science, and often metaphysics, of the ancients" (p.36).Although Wilson says that it may somehow be possible to reconcile these different views, she concludes that "Augustinian theology...is very far from Descartes's " (p. 40). A difference of opinion perhaps, but one wonders if Ravven doesn't squeeze the facts (if indeed they are facts) to fit her bill.She also cites an amazing amount of recent findings in brain science and psychological research to undergird her thesis. This part takes up about a third of the book. It's sometimes so overwhelming that one starts wondering if it weren't possible to gather support for just the opposite view, e.g., on the questions of innate ideas versus the impact of the (social) environment, a modular brain versus cerebral plasticity, or group selection versus the selfish gene. Ravven never mentions Richard Dawkins and refers to the hotly debated evolutionary psychologist Steven Pinker just once - parenthesized in a footnote. Nevertheless, the sheer effort and perseverance she puts into her line of argument is astounding. To be able to follow her, the reader must exhibit a fair amount of staying power as well as flexibility. It's certainly a highly original and thought-provoking book, written with gusto, conviction, and clarity. It's also a considerable mine of information on a wide range of subjects. But even if it contributes to a shift of emphasis, it's doubtful whether it succeeds conclusively in relegating free will to the realm of the mythological.Her invocation of Spinoza gets an unexpected twist in the final chapter where she tries to combine his thoughts with the contemporary deep ecology movement. At the risk of sounding fuzzy, she says that to be ethical is "to be with others and make the best of the world" (p.418) and that "a self-reflecting understanding of the eco-biological reality" is needed to integrate "the self-reflection into the self - and thereby transforming the self as within its eco-world and universe" (p.479).We've come a long way from the educational curricula of the opening chapter.

$review_text.: Although this author's story is fascinating, I feel his conclusions may lead some people astray....or cause them great fear, especially if they have lost a loved one to alcoholism or other addictions
 The thought that some people's spirits are in limbo, still craving whatever they were addicted to even after they die, is not Biblical

Some of the Lord's children are addicted, but I believe they are freed after they return to Him, just as are the ones who might have been in great suffering from cancer or other things before their death


 At the beginning of the book, I really liked it but by the end, I had a very "yukky" feeling about this book and even threw it away, did not want it in my house.

$review_text.: BEWARE OF SPOILERS!!In order to describe this book, it is necessary to write about some things that I ordinarily wouldn't give away.The book is divided into three parts.  First is the entire pack's acceptance and celebration of the new babies and celebration of Christmas in the snow.This quickly segues into the dramatic and well planned revenge Michaela extracts on the Iowa wolves for her kidnapping in the previous book.Finally, the best part and DON'T READ THIS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW:Michaela is put on trial for insubordination and disobeying Lara by going after the Iowa City wolves.  This part of the book is thrilling, there is just no other word.  Like a fox, Michaela thinks her way through it, and by the end, claims victory and returns to her mate and children.  How she does it is the thrust of the story, her reason, intelligence and foxy cleverness is what makes this series so good.Michaela can kick butt when needed, but it's the way she out-smarts every obstacle that makes her such a role model as a heroine.  I love this whole series and this book is one of the best.Now, I must admit that I would have preferred one or two things to be more detailed.  We never find out what happens to Kimberlee Morten.  We're told at one point that she's alive, but we never find out what the cost was to her to return home as Michaela's ransom.At another point Greg Freund says, "Michaela, I just took your money.  I never stab my clients in the back.  You are now a client."  He does later stab her in the back, but has returned her money first.  Or does he?  If what eventually happens is in Michaela's own best interests, is that truly stabbing her in the back?  The is unresolved.We never see what happens to the Iowa wolves from their point of view.  There were several who had been blackmailed into participating in the kidnapping, and while Michaela states she is not specifically gunning for them, but if they get killed, it's the breaks.  We never get to see what they think of the outcome.We get to see a couple of details of the second bride kidnap game, but it would be nice to read that story if you decide to publish it, Ms Roseau.

$REVIEW.: This read nearly like a Dan Brown novel. It was full of history's mysteries, emotional turmoil, suspense and action with a side of wonderfully hot romance.  The author is amazing with details and emotion.  Dan and Rayne are beautifully developed characters--both very masculine and both very stubborn.  I loved their chemistry and the intense, powder keg of heat between them.  The only thing I would say about it on the negative side was that, as an American, I had some issues with slang English terms. It was a bit frustrating to find myself saying "what the hell does that even mean?" right in the middle of a poignant dialogue between characters.  I don't think it distracted from the book enough to change my rating to anything less than 5 stars though.  Definitely worth reading!

$review_text.: Willaim Lane Craig describes and defends his view on God's relationship to time, giving arguments for and against both temporal and timeless existence for God. Craig concludes that there is better reason to think God is temporal. Then Craig defends his the A theory of time against the B theory. Craig deals with many interesting, difficult, and hard to understand theories in this book, but makes it as easy as it can possibly be made for a popular audience. (And, given his lengthy discussion of relativity theory, this was no doubt not easy). Anyone who reads this book will come away with a much better understanding of God's relationship to time, and time itself, then they had before they opened it.The only drawback is that God's relationship to time is not a huge theological/philosophical topic, and therefore, this might not be a high priority book for many people. I concede that, but then say that for those who wish to learn more about it, I highly recommend it.
$SUMMARY.: Again, Craig makes a difficult topic followable

After years of feelings of inadequacy she has learned to block the feelings from showing. But in her mind, they rage. Then her sister comes up with a plan to have an "adopted" family member escort Camryn to the wedding as her boyfriend. Troy is the man who is devil may care. Always open for a good time, but with Camryn he faces things in his past that only Camryn knows.This was a great love story. The feelings between Troy and Camryn were real and so full of love. I laughed and sniffled along with the both of them. Kelly wrote an emotional and real story of two people who filled in the void for each other, whether they knew it or not. Wonderful story!

$review_text.: As I started this story I was intrigued by it as I read about one boys fascination with a beautiful girl and another boys love of the falcon she raised. He wanted nothing more than to soar with the bird and Robin Ingle made that image become very clear to me through her words. The Hunt  is another story of historical fiction that I was totally entertained with. This is the second of The World's Edge Series and equally as good as the first Tyrker's Tale.

$REVIEW.: I don&#8217;t know what it is about books and movies centred on American football (or as Americans call it...football) but it is like catnip for me! The Blind Side, Friday Night Lights, Remember the Titans I cannot get enough! So when I heard of Allison Parr&#8217;s series I knew I was in for a treat and RUSH ME is definitely a favourite book to add to my football obsession!Rachel Hamilton is a publishing graduate currently holding down an unpaid internship while her savings pay for her Brooklyn rental and groceries. When her roommate invites her to a swanky party in Manhattan Rachel accidentally wanders into the wrong apartment and comes face to face with a world far removed from anything she could imagine &#8211; professional football. Trading barbs with NFL quarterback Ryan Carter only serves to remind her that this is not her scene however when Ryan&#8217;s teammates take a shine to the only girl who hasn&#8217;t fallen head over heels for their cocky football star Rachel finds herself constantly thrown together with Ryan. As the months pass, Rachel and Ryan bicker constantly, challenge each other&#8217;s preconceptions and prejudices and realise that perhaps first impressions aren&#8217;t always reliable and opposites really do attract...There is one reason above all others that I adored this book; the main characters COMMUNICATE! Yes they talk! They don&#8217;t give mixed signals, they don&#8217;t say &#8220;I&#8217;m fine&#8221; while secretly simmering with anger, they lay it all out there and damn the consequences. It was so refreshing to read and interesting to see it all play out.I adored both characters, Rachel was a fresh and funny heroine, eager to give her opinion despite an underlying feeling of inadequacy present at all times as she feels she&#8217;s floundering while everyone else&#8217;s careers seem to be on track. When she meets Ryan and is introduced to a world of extreme privilege rewarded for simply &#8220;kicking a football&#8221; she cannot comprehend it. She can&#8217;t understand how brawn is favoured over intellect but as the months go on and she spends time with Ryan she comes to realise that there is a lot more to football than meets the eye. Likewise with Ryan, after years of being fawned over as God&#8217;s gift to sport and women, meeting Rachel is an eye-opener and it plays on his insecurities too as he is constantly reminded that without football he doesn&#8217;t have a secure backup plan. Through the couple&#8217;s constant bickering both Rachel and Ryan come to realise that their fears and inadequacies are one more thing they have in common that neither want to admit.There&#8217;s some serious chemistry between these two and the sexual heat is searing when they stop talking however their conversation is definitely the sexiest and most interesting aspect to this couple. Their banter is never completely innocent and always has a sharp edge to it that cuts right to the nerve. At times I winced at how vicious and brutally honest the pair were towards each other as they really uncovered each others&#8217; vulnerabilities and attacked them to break down the barriers both had erected to protect themselves. I simply loved it. They used words as both weapons and to heal, there were no stupid silences; every moment between them was pulsing with energy.The secondary characters were another highlight for me especially Ryan&#8217;s teammates whom Parr managed to make distinctly memorable. The exploration into the world of publishing was another highlight for me on a personal level and I also highly enjoyed how Parr explored Rachel&#8217;s Judaism and Ryan&#8217;s Catholicism and how they differed but more importantly ultimately interconnected.RUSH ME was a fantastic, refreshing take on the New Adult genre/category with memorable characters full of passion and a great storyline that provided me with plenty to think about. Thoroughly enjoyable!

$REVIEW.: I really enjoyed this debut novel by Violet Vaughn, her descriptions of the life of as a ski instructor felt some real and her real life experience of the profession rather than just based on research was clear through her writing.  Casey is torn between her relationships of Jason and Blaine. I felt the author did a cracking job of keeping the love triangle moving without overdoing it.  The whole issue of whether Blaine was heterosexual, gay or perhaps even bi was sympathetically portrayed, you could feel his confusion and torn loyalty to Casey and other friends in his life to be seen as &#8220;normal&#8221;.  The character development of Casey was good as she moved through her journey of leaving Jason behind, meeting Blaine to seeing Jason again. All in all a great balance of themes. I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

$REVIEW.: Created worlds, lots of space gunnery, many of the world systems challenge the laws of physics, and the battles generally result in the hero's inferior forces beating the bad guys with superior tactics, luck, willpower and elan.  Great read.  Fast action to start and it seldom slows.  While young, the hero is able to act in a decisive manner, more cleaver than anyone above him and manages a crew at the level of someone with several years experience on his maiden voyage. There is a sequel that is just as good, just as preposterous.

$REVIEW.: After reading this I really have to get a copy of Abba's Child by Brennan Manning! I was interested in reviewing this book since I work with the youth at our church. I loved the very casual writing style of Brennan Manning. I appreciate how very open and candid both authors are about their flaws and short-comings and that they are very comfortable in God's love. They nailed it on the head when discussing our feelings of uncomfort when we are confronted with God's unconditional love.The aim of this book is to bring into light what Christ spoke so plainly over 2000 years ago and what God has whispered across time and eternity: You are loved just the way you are!! God sees the individual as what he/she will become. It is vitally important to accept ourselves as we are in the light of God's love and the knowledge that we are a work in progress.I can't wait to recommend this to others, especially teens. I wish someone had written this when I was a young person. So that I could have lived in the richness of God's blessings for a longer time. It has not been until recent years that I have become more at peace with my identity in Christ and like Manning, I too have to daily put to death "The Poser".This is a powerful book. Parents read it for yourself then read it with your teens! Empower them for a life of success and peace - help them to become centered in Christ!Thank you NavPress for this review copy

$review_text.: I just finished reading Out of Breath and I wanted to acknowledge how well the author, Susan Salluce, developed the story line.  Following the tragic drowning of little Nevaeh the book deals directly with the emotional impact that her loss brings to her parents, older sister and extended family.  I enjoyed how the plot of the story was developed from the perspective of each main character.  I was especially impressed how the psycho-therapist, Katherine, professionally guided Seth and Alyssa through their dark and bitter journey of anger and blame to the point that they were able to mourn the death of their child by supporting one another. I found Out of Breath to be a book that I will remember for months to come and I would recommend this book to others.

$REVIEW.: Smoke Burnham is a colorful daredevil in the air that loves racing, but hates crowds. To help him keep the onlookers at bay, Smoke has an eccentric flying companion, a pet cheetah named Patty.Smoke has signed up for the international air race that will take him and Sandy on the flight of their lives. The race will take them to Central America, over the Andes and across the Brazilian jungle. In addition, Smoke has to contend with a newspaper mogul who wants to make this his last flight and win over the woman he loves.The multicast performance, featuring Shane Johnson, does an excellent job bringing the characters to life. The various mannerisms draws the listeners in. Add in the music and special effects and the listener feels like they are in the plane with Smoke and Patty. Also performing on the audio are Corey Burton, R.F. Daley, Keli Daniels, and Jim Meskimer.The story is fast pace and will capture your attention from beginning to end. This story was originally published in the June 1935 issue of  Five Novels Monthly.FTC Full Disclosure - This audio book was sent to me by the publisher in hopes I would review it. However, receiving the complimentary copy did not influence my review.

$review_text.: Chasing Fate, by Maria Miller is one those books that you just can&#8217;t stop reading
Both a mystery and an action adventure, Chasing Fate gave me an exciting read right from the first page


The lead heroine, Kate, is near the end of her senior year in high school, a typical teenager, who can&#8217;t wait to finish school
Why? He father, though wealthy and a well-respected businessman, is also an alcoholic, frequently terrorizing Kate and his wife

As the story begins, coming home drunk again, he ripped up Kate&#8217;s final term paper for her English class, a paper worth seventy percent of her grade
Kate has never told anyone about her home situation, claiming this time she didn&#8217;t write the paper

Her teacher gives her one last chance


Interview someone.Wanting nothing to do with her father&#8217;s friends, she rebels and interviews a homeless bum in the park, there in New Orleans


Expecting nothing much from the man, she hears an incredible story


He was a Navy SEAL and a sniper, who has murdered many


However, on his last assignment, he stole a golden idol from a cave in the jungles of Ecuador, before shooting his partner, who was also supposed to shoot him
Now, the bum is remorseful, haunted by his memories, and wants to return the idol and receive forgiveness

Knowing that he cannot do it, he gives the idol to Kate, begging her to return it to its rightful owners.Unsure how much of this tale is true, Kate takes a drawing of the idol to a local professor, who wants that idol at any cost! Worse, her English paper was discovered by a CIA official, who had ordered the SEALs to hit their last targets in Ecuador, in an attempt to cover up a secret covert operation of his


Now both men are after the idol and the CIA man wants her eliminated as well.Kate&#8217;s onetime boyfriend, Jeff, rescues her just as two hit men are about to kidnap the unsuspecting teen


Mystified by this, Kate decides to return the idol to the bum in the park, but finds the bum missing and the park filled with men digging holes looking for something
Now, the situation turns deadly serious


Kate and Jeff flee their homes, intending to first get away from these men and later to try to return the idol themselves.The two lead characters, Kate and Jeff, are well-developed and seem to me to be very real teens


In my opinion, the description of life with an alcoholic father is realistically portrayed and accurate, making the story seem very believable from the first pages.The minimalist writing style combined with fast-paced action keeps the reader constantly moving through the pages! Although targeting YA, this novel is well worth reading by anyone who likes mystery and action-adventure

I give it 5 stars!

$REVIEW.: Dark Edge was a real page turner for me, a character-driven romance between soldiers on opposing sides of a planetary invasion. Although this novel is billed as SF M/M, the setting might as well be modern Afghanistan during the Soviet occupation.This book has a ton of strengths: fabulous writing, excellent pacing, and a compelling military plot. But the lead characters are what sets it apart--both leads are nuanced and well-developed, and I loved them both. While there is plenty of hot sex in the book--and it's well-written sex--you'll have to look elsewhere if you're looking for nasty.&lt;i>Dark Edge&lt;/i> is a keeper for me, and goes high on my list of favorite M/M SF.

$REVIEW.: This book is totally different than Ella Fox's Hart Series.  Mia and Tristan are both broken and in desperate need of mending and patching.  When Mia meets Tristan she is still recovering from a horrific incident that happened to here only a few months ago.  Tristan is trying to deal with his past and the only way he knows how is to be a manwhore.  Add in his hot twin brother and Mia's roommate Darby and you have 2 very hot couples!  Even tho I felt that this story could use a little more depth and it seemed like another story of the bad boy turned good by love, I still liked the characters.A horrible thing was done to Mia and her friend Macy, and even though it didn't happen until the end, I am glad that those little pricks got what was coming to them and even Tristan got his chance to beat the crap out of one them! Mia and Tristan both have their demons but are able to work them out and create a beautiful relationship together.Darby and Tristan's brother, Trace, competed very hard for the starring roles of this book and I'm excited to read their book. I would also like for Macy, Mia's other friend to have a book with a HEA that she deserves!!Ella Fox is by far one of my favorite authors and even though this book wasn't a complete win with me, I still look forward to the next book!

$review_text.: **This review is done in conjuction with NerdGirl, for more info, check them out on FB **I&#8217;ve been on a YA kick lately, I like the genre, and so picking up Hidden Wings, I was excited


Angels aren&#8217;t at the top of my paranormal creatures list, like dragons and fae, and sirens are, but Cameo Renee is going to change that

This book kicked some serious literary butt

We&#8217;re brought into the world pretty quickly, and we just need to roll with it, because this book has great pacing, and a smooth style that works with the high level of action that we&#8217;re given

Emma is a great character, she&#8217;s a teen who&#8217;s thrown into a whole new world, and she acts like it
Something that drives me crazy in YA is when characters don&#8217;t act normal
They don&#8217;t experience things the same way as real teenager would, but I felt like Emma really struggled like a normal teenager would dealing with the loss of her parents, new family, new state and a whole new world


I thought the introduction of the angelic elements, and villains was well done, it was placed at good moments in order to interest us, but not overwhelm us

I&#8217;m not really a big fan of instant love connections, but in this book, I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s more described, and has a nice historical backing to it


Overall, I devoured this book
I picked it up, flew through it, loved it, and wanted to scream at the ending


Luckily, I have the rest of the series to fly through as well, so I didn&#8217;t have to wait, but this book was good

It introduced us to the world, to a possible love interest, to a whole new world, a new family, and a major danger
Emma goes through a nice change in this novel, really blooming into her new self and experiencing the angelic powers in a way, even though she&#8217;s still a year away from fully coming into hers
The evil in this book is also well written, I like what we deal with the Darklings, and how evil they are, and then we get to know the Fallen, who have a story all their own
Are they completely evil? I&#8217;ll let you read and see what you think, but I thought the author did an outstanding job creating a variety of characters with a host of different traits and really kept her background people from being one dimensional which tends to happen in YA once the heroine and her love interest are introduced, but I love the whole cast of Guardians, they each have a personality, some are snarky, some are funny, and they are all loyal

Kade is obviously the standout, as the main love interest, he&#8217;s sweet, funny, smart, and completely interested in Emma, but he can also kick major ass, and take some darkling names, and that in itself was interesting

I did like how Emma developed, and started to stand on her own two feet, and not be so afraid by the end of the book


I would highly recommend this book


I know there&#8217;s a lot of Cassandra Clare angel hype going on right now, but I promise you, if you&#8217;re a fan of angels and you miss out on this series, you should kick yourself, or call me, and I&#8217;ll kick you


It&#8217;s phenomenal, and I&#8217;m already flying through the next book in the series! Pick up this book, do it! :)**I was given a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review

$SUMMARY.: Amazing! This story will blow you away, and have you one clicking the rest of the series!

$REVIEW.: because slow cookers are so convenient but the variety of diabetic recipes were always so limited.  By the way, my very picky eater (6 yo) has tried and even liked a few of the things we have tried . . . We loved the Country Chicken, even Mr. Picky!  The Mediterrean Meatloaf was great - - Mr. Picky ate a few bites.  We really enjoyed the Italian Pork Chops - - Mr. Picky even liked the orzo!I had to pretend the Irish Stew was made with pork chops to get the boys to eat it, but they liked it.  Next time I may tell them we are trying it with lamb.

$REVIEW.: I love this new take on the Headless Horseman "Legend of Sleepy Hollow" story by Dax Varley.  The heroine, Katrina, is fierce, brave and not afraid to speak her mind.  Of course, this frequently gets her in trouble. The romance with Ichabod Crane was a surprising, nice touch and the completely surprising ending blew me away. Readers will love the characters, the mysterious atmosphere and story-line, and it had enough shivers to keep me reading long into the wee hours of the night.

$review_text.: I finished reading this last night as I was sitting in the chair rocking my baby boy. He hasn't been feeling well and I was awake and dying to finish the story to see what happens to Spring and Henry. My final thought? I NEED MORE HENRY EDWARD KNIGHTLY... the third.Definitely, Maybe in Love is a love story about two people who are polar opposites with one big thing in common: they are both very opinionated. Spring Honeycutt is an environmentalist and she looks the part. Her style is very low maintenance. She's afraid that if she looks too materialistic no one will take her seriously about her major and she's very defensive about both. Henry Knightly is rich, privileged and studying to be a lawyer, and he just so happens to be the only person on campus who can help Spring with her thesis. The only thing standing in Springs way is the fact that she can't stand the guy. He pushes her buttons in a way that no one else can and gets completely under her skin. Yet she's still incredibly attracted to him.Thus begins a romance where both parties run hot and cold constantly, always misunderstanding situations and words that are said. Springs past has left her vulnerable, naive and guarded in a way that makes her insecure so that when Henry seems cold, she flips out and instantly gets on the defensive. Their communication skills were great in all areas except for where it concerned their relationship and the people closest to them. They were always misinterpreting the others actions, causing a lot of heartbreak that could have been avoided if only they had just been open with each other. This should have been a huge turn off, but all of this was mixed with really amazing moments between the two where they truly get to know each other, mostly through debating and egging each other on. Henry more so than Spring because she was always getting fired up about the issues she cared about with such simple statements from Henry. I enjoyed those scenes the most, along with the romantic scenes.I had forgotten about the whole &#34;modern take on Pride and Prejudice&#34; thing until a reread the premise when I put it on this post, and that was when it hit me that it is incredibly like Pride and Prejudice. It's been a while since I've read the book by Jane Austen, but I remember enough to see the parallels between the two. The first time Spring and Henry meet, he is utterly uninterested and Spring overhears him talking to his friend (who just so happens to have a thing for her best friend Julia) about her and how she was just a tree-hugging hippy and completely unattractive. But the more time they spend together, the more they both realize they've fallen madly in love yet neither can seem to express it. I truly fell for Henry right along with Spring and I would definitely read more about these two if there were ever a sequel *hint hint HINT*Spring did get on my nerves a few times because of her insecurities and tendencies to jump to conclusions, but I could also understand where she was coming from so it didn't bother me to the point of ruining the book for me. I also didn't like her name in the beginning but it definitely grew on me, as did she at the end of the book when she finally lets her guard down and has faith not only in herself but in Henry.I just love when books leave me feeling high on love and this one does just that. Definitely, Maybe in Love is a wonderful retelling of one of my favorite classic novels. If you love Pride and Prejudice, you will definitely enjoy this one.
$SUMMARY.: I need more Henry Knightly!!

$review_text.: This is my favorite of the series so far.  I loved the interaction between Prince and Guilianna. Both hard nosed, hard hitting attorneys, their battles are a form of foreplay for them.I loved the information of their backgrounds, how Guilianna's early years formed her personality. The strength of character in her, and the willingness to surrender to her worst nightmare to help someone else is wonderful.Prince is hot, dreamy, steamy!  What a man!  When he sees that Guilianna is afraid, he takes care of her, putting his own desires in the  background.  Doing everything he can to help her.The passion between them is explosive. The honesty between them sweet and lovely set in a hardcore BDSM environment. The sex is wow! The power of trust between Prince and Guilianna enthralling.

I jumped into the first chapter and knew immediately that Daytona was on the right track.As a woman, I have experienced those terrible pick-up lines. This book encourages men to get over their shyness, learn how to have fun, and engage women in an interaction that builds relationships. She gives amusing lines that work. I personally met the man of my dreams. And if I had read her book first, I would have thought he had read it, too.I highly recommend this book. Don&#8217;t waste another day on those old lines. Find a gal and see how well it works.

$REVIEW.: Having also been laid off from a corporate job after 10 years of servitude, I found the premise of this book to be one that attracted me more, at the beginning, as a manual for using your time to complete whatever it was you started but couldn't finish because of work. I was thinking more about fixing this or that, finishing projects, reading that stack of books etc. I must say I was surprised that this was much more than what I'd expected and 1,000 times better than Eat Pray Love for many reasons. In the book, Lee Kravitz details a year in his life after layoff where, in sorting through the objects of his past, he begins to face the things he either left behind, buried deep inside or simply, was too darned scared of to deal with during other times in his life. Lee's list included relatively small matters like repaying a $600 loan to a friend he traveled with in youth but had lost track of to (emotionally) larger matters like expressing condolences to another friend whose daughter had been killed during an ambush in Iraq. In the process, he strengthens bonds with his children, wife and father (this was more of an understanding and acceptance of his father), rekindled dormant friendships and renewed relationships with extended family members through his efforts to bring some cheer into the life of a long-lost relative. I think what affected me most was his industriousness in completing his list (along the lines of completing the tasks at hand, one-by-one-by-one-by-one) without underestimating the therapeutic benefit of focusing on something other than yourself (which could get dicey when one loses a job). The reason I say I found this so much better than Eat Pray Love was because the writer began his journey from home base without the luxury of a new environment from which to regroup. He tackled each item bit by bit while coming to terms with and building upon the life he had already created. There was no running away with a few hundred thousand dollars and an assignment. It was Lee Kravitz surrounded by the past, his fears and lots of lost time to make up for.There are a number of lessons which can be gleaned from reading this, but I find I have to comment on Mr. Kravitz's writing ability which I found refreshingly flawless.I can't recommend this book highly enough. It really inspired me to take an accounting of my own life to see what may have been overlooked and what opportunities there are to make amends.Please read this.

$review_text.: What a frustrating heroine! She kept making up excuses of why she wasn't in love with Stephen anymore. Her reasons were not good enough when Stephen had never been mean to her - not even when he was drunk! I wanted to slap her. I felt she was undeserving of him. He never question his love or needed reassurance all of a sudden... She was so stubborn and insisted on letting him go... Not a way to convince me you still love someone when you try your best to deny it. I wonder why Stephen didn't give up on her sooner and after all He's been through she really had no consideration of him and love to jump to conclusions about his character and never giving him the benefit of the doubt despite knowing him all her life. Yes war can change people but you don't give up on them the first night they do something you think is wrong. I'm sorry but I can't stand Jane and the only reason I give this three stars is because Stephen is a great hero. I think having the h/h already in love and each knowing it, posed a challenge for the author she couldn't execute correctly, resulting in giving us a poorly done heroine to read about. Overall, just an ok read.

$review_text.: Molly Anne is born and grows up in the wrong place -- she is made for the American west coast 'live and let live' lifestyle.  She chafes under the expectations she faces as a young woman in Athens, Georgia -- the need to be ladylike, keep her hair blond, wear dresses and pearls, marry well.  Her mother resists her need to be different, as if her strong will can change her daughter.  Molly is pretty and has a size 2 figure.  She wears black jeans and tank tops, has a nose ring and nipple rings, dyes her hair black and purple and wears those giant earlobe hole rings that look distractingly painful.  She has no friends and has had a string of one-night boyfriends.  It is heartbreaking that a likable rebel has had such a hard go of her childhood and teenage years.When she is 26, the night after her sister's wedding, Molly packs two suitcases and her guitar, Simon, and moves to Seattle.  The one part of Athens she enjoyed was singing once a week at the local coffeehouse, but that gig won't pay her rent. She hopes she will have more luck -- and find more people like her -- in the music scene in the Emerald City.Her parents object -- they freeze her bank account and hide her car, both of which they are co-signers on -- and Molly does her best to soldier on, finding a job, screening their calls and texts, and starting her new life.I hear about young people who have lots of energy and skip college and think: is it dyslexia?  Is it ADD?  She certainly is smart and capable.  Poor Molly may have needed some outside experts to help her diagnose why she is struggling.  Instead, Molly's mother signs her and her noxious sister up for beauty pageants.  Molly does not win them.Molly has some deep resentments to overcome.  But she loves her new job and throws everything she has to give into making herself a success.  You admire her unflagging work ethic, her problem-solving, her backbone in challenging situations with headstrong bad boys who tower over her petite frame.  She is good at what she does and day after day she gets her job done without complaining.I like this first book in the series a lot.  Molly makes some mistakes and some she repeats -- at the end of this book she is facing some errors in judgement that maybe she could have avoided if she had talked to someone or confronted them sooner.  I wish these new authors would find proofreaders before they self-publish.  It's a courtesy to the readers who buy your book.  Leave me a comment if you would like my help with book two.

First of all, I'm old and have no memory and second, I read A LOT.  But, on the bright side, you never have to be afraid I'll spoil the ending for you because, for some reason, I can hardly ever remember it.  Keeping that in mind, here is my take on Only the Truth; I kind of liked it.  The main character is kind of simple, as in simple-minded, but he's also single-minded, as it turns out.  An interesting story, well-written and well-told.  Let me know how it ends.

I was not prepared for the messages this book drove into my heart.  The amazing book began with wonderful and insightful information about understanding the news process so that you can position yourself and receive the most accurate exposure.  This was already a great book, then Lori shared an example that demonstrated how she had executed the academic details of this book in a very intense and personal story.  This book is the best of both worlds and even carried a third world of understand more about the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD).  Although this book demonstrates an amazing author who has written an amazing book BUT the one thing that really stands above the crowd of books, is the family values, strength, dedication, integrity, honesty, love, sacrifice and much much more that create the backbone of our great country.  We need more books like this. "Excellent" book.  10 Stars********** I could go on, but I think you get the picture.  Buy the book, you will be so glad you did. Lauren Taite Vines

$review_text.: Devoured is the first book in best-selling author Jason Brant's new series, The Hunger
It's based off a short story he wrote titled LOTION, written for Apocalypse: An Anthology by Authors and Readers.The novel starts off with Lance York - a man who, by his own admission, is a loser


Barely able to hold a job and coming upon an impending divorce, Lance sees no light in sight

Things get even worse for the poor man when, after saving a sickly woman from being hit by a car, he finds himself stuck in a quarantined hospital

Things escalate quickly as the sickly woman makes a return, but as something else

She has begun to mutate, as has many others
Cities begin to fall, the military steps in but proves to be ineffective, and civilization starts its inevitable collapse
All within the span of a day.Lance now has to survive in this newly ravaged world, coming to terms with the drastic changes to his life and assimilating to the new laws of the new, burnt world

It's kill or be killed now, and Lance, with his new companion Cass who is much more than she appears, decides it's not him who's going down.This story was brilliantly written, each scene depicted with such detail and care that it was like a true horror movie in my head


There are humorous parts as well, as is Jason Brant's signature, timed well and not out-of-place like some novels tend to do
There's always a good joke to be had when the tension begins to cease, and Jason Brant makes sure the joke is spoken!The monsters in this novel were unique

They're vampires, sort of
They aren't your average, run-of-the-mill blood suckers
They're mutated monsters who have nothing of their past human lives left inside of them except for a few snippets of intelligence - which only makes them more terrifying


The Vladdies - as Brant has dubbed them - can only come out at night, but that doesn't mean the daytime is safe
Those who were recently infected are still able to roam in the light, and prove to be a threat bigger than you'd expect


No time and nowhere is safe from these creatures, and though things look bleak Lance and Cass trudge on in the hopes of finding salvation.I sincerely enjoyed this book and positively can't wait for the next one!

$review_text.: This book was soo good! It was such a quick read for me because I was constantly anticipating what would happen next, therefore I couldn't put it down! The storyline is extremely unique. It isn't your typical adult romance read. It has such in depth characters that you begin to get very involved with the story. This book made me smile, laugh, tear up and baffle me in pure astonishment/shock. I was expecting the story to be a bit more explicit considering Lacey initially published this story under another pen name, however compared to her other books I can understand why she'd want to separate the two. I'm really looking forward to more from the Fringe series and hope as the series continues, the story becomes more raunchy and obscene. ;)

$REVIEW.: I was pleasantly surprised and delighted when amazon offered a kindle matchbook of the hardcover copy I bought at a very low price of less than $5.00! It was truly a great offer given the quality of the book.I&#8217;m a novice and idiot baker and this book has proven to be very helpful. It is not for advanced bakers though as they may find many of the lessons too basic. From the introductory pages, the book has proven to be really loaded with information and helpful tips. The most useful ones being those related on how to correct errors or repair damage.Compared with other books on baking, this one has particularly been clear with the techniques that may be applied to almost any baking activity.I have just purchased the hardcover and kindle editions and already I&#8217;m able to apply some of its tips.

$review_text.: Under laws of primogeniture, lords and ladies of 19th-century Britain passed expanses of wealth exclusively to first-born sons while others received little financial support. But as adults, silver-spoon-fed children were encouraged to uphold the image of privilege anyhow, guided by the relentless whisper of a gentleman's conscience that ensured no one was ever free to conduct oneself in any natural or different way than tradition would present, essentially boiling down to a nation's belief of inherent class superiority and entitlement in all things. Often the second-born's search for an occupation took him to fairer shores. This leads to the subject of Anthony C. Winkler's fabulous entertaining satire: the British occupation of Jamaica.The setting is Jamaica's sugar plantations, and the protagonist is a twentysomething named Hartley Fudges, a laughable fellow who might even be likable if he weren't inherently selfish. His creed being "all for one" and being the second-born, Hartley must depend on his own resources and cleverness for any future. Lacking real-life skills or work ethic, he feels completely entitled to seduce or connive his way into any future that will provide money, so his first move is to seduce a wealthy widow. That failing, he moves quickly to his next inspired idea: to murder his brother using the gentleman's ideal against himself, the code that a wealthy man must defend his honor in the case of any sleight by a fellow gentleman. When the assassination fails, Hartley is miserably ejected from England, his brother demanding his removal, which necessitates Hartley's voyage to Jamaica. This is the place that becomes his home.The Fudges family name is enough to gain Hartley considerable power in managing a sugar plantation, and he lands a job almost immediately aboard the Mermaid, a vessel that carries passengers along with slaves from various cultures. Upon reaching the island and beginning his work as an overseer, Hartley finds that it is an entirely new learning experience. But Hartley is still Hartley, and the gentleman directs his own thoughts and philosophies. Befriending another overseer of the Mount Pleasant Plantation, Hartley becomes an average slavedriver, a position of ultimate power over hundreds of slaves, leading to false securities about power; the overseers are outnumbered by the slaves on the island by more than 10 to 1.A friend of Hartley's by the name of Meredith warns him very early on that their job is a "cruel, brutal business," to be carried out thoughtlessly for the sole goals of profit and maximum efficiency. Prophetically, Meredith also tells him a few facts about the island, including predictions about some of the cultures and their behavior. He is warned that  "your skin color may be the same as another man's but it doesn't automatically make him your ally." And Meredith urges Hartley to "try to show respect to everyone you meet...especially to the slaves" because pride is all they have. But real respect is something Hartley doesn't understand. In a matter of months, he becomes a slave owner of a very proud young slave who has taken an interest in forming his own character, and also finds a lover who he happens to genuinely fall in love with, a very simple, devoted and painfully honest slave woman named Phibba who is very genuinely in love with Hartley, though she knows little of the character of the English gentleman.As an island native himself, Winkler does a fabulous job of recreating Jamaica at it was while showing the roots of today's island culture. His depictions of the English aristocrat vary greatly from the images we are familiar with; the gentleman here is clearly nothing more than a mindless bully, overly convinced of his superiority, lacking insight into himself or others, savagely willing to take advantage whenever presented the opportunity --- even to the point of rape --- of cultures he deems beneath him. This is a man who is nave to his own nature. Winkler asserts that the coveted "family mansion" was never anything but a "breeder of claim-jumpers, invaders, and glib usurpers," and that England's labor pains were due to its ego issues and the consequences of primogeniture --- a law that much of Europe had done away with by the early 1800s, but Britain seemed unwilling to let go of.THE FAMILY MANSION is an intensely charming book that is truly laugh-out-loud funny from cover to cover. It is both smart and witty, full of sophisticated surprises, great insights and very unique historical perspectives. It delves heavily into philosophy and really entertains. This is not the type of novel with which you will easily get bored. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys wonderful writing, great humor, or human interest stories.Reviewed by Melanie Smith

$review_text.: for this little delight of a book.Since I was in elementary school, Honest Abe has been one of my (political) heroes. (My other political heroes are Thomas Jefferson, Eleanor Roosevelt, Adlai Stevenson, Golda Meir, and Rudy Giuliani.)Here are my two absolute favorite parts:The story about how Lincoln and some friends were riding on a country road after a very severe windstorm. He saw two little birds who had been blown from their nest and were too young to fly. The mother bird, naturally, was in great distress.My beloved Mr. Abraham Lincoln spent an hour, with the two baby birds in his hand, hunting down the nest. His compatriots laughed at him. This man with "the tenderest heart for anyone in distress, whether man, beast or bird," responded to their laughter by saying, "Gentlemen, you may laugh, but I could not have slept well to-night if I had not saved those birds. Their cries would have rung in my ears."The other story is about what a wonderfully indulgent, patient, loving parent he was. His kids could come to his office and mess up the entire place, and it didn't bother him. In fact, his fellow lawyer writes, "Had they (the kids) s--t in Lincoln's hat and rubbed it on his boots, he would have laughed and thought it smart...." While I was roaring with laughter at that sentence, my heart was filled to overflowing with love for the wonderful man that Abraham Lincoln was.Order this book now. It's a winner!

$REVIEW.: How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia is the best book I've read this year because it made me think and then it made me cry


For a book with such a coarsely straightforward title, it's remarkably beautiful; a love story (in a book whose third chapter title instructs: "Don't Fall in Love") about the power of connections between people.That sounds rather trite, non? Yet this book made it seem like the most novel idea in the world
Mohsin Hamid chooses to write his simple story under the guise of a self-help book
We readers are addressed as "you" but "you" is also the main character, an Asian male we follow from birth to death as he becomes filthy rich


It's an inventive method of narration that will likely fail for many people, but I found it inspired in the way it both separates and unites the reader and protagonist

As both the protagonist and an outsider, we can observe the protagonist's failures with the detachment of someone who knows better, all the while suffering, and occasionally rejoicing, alongside him


We are complicit in his choices and thus, after reading, we feel compelled to evaluate our own choices.In tone, it reminded me of Kazuo Ishiguro's masterpiece The Remains of the Day
Both novels feature men who devote their lives to an occupation and realize, too late, the unworthiness of their chosen lives

Hamid's writing is less formal though no less moving

It's clever--"Is getting filthy rich still your goal above all goals, your be-all and end-all, the mist-shrouded high-altitude spawning pond to your inner salmon?"And beautiful--"He whispers a benediction and breathes it into the air, spreading his hopes for you with a contraction of the lungs."He uses lots of appositives to pack complex asides into otherwise short and simple sentences

It's masterful, simply some of the best writing I've ever read.Hamid also has the most fascinating things to say about the relationship between a writer and a reader and the importance of writing and reading to our lives


Do you read this and nod so deeply your skull grazes the nape of your neck?"...When you read a book, what you see are black squiggles on pulped wood or, increasingly, dark pixels on a pale screen
To transform these icons into characters and events, you must imagine

And when you imagine, you create

It's in being read that a book becomes a book, and in each of a million different readings a book becomes one of a million different books, just as an egg becomes one of potentially a million different people when it's approached by a hard-swimming and frisky school of sperm."I do

He just gets it

He profoundly understands the importance of stories to our every day lives:"We are all refugees from our childhoods
And so we turn, among other things, to stories

To write a story, to read a story, is to be a refugee from the state of refugees


Writers and readers seek a solution to the problem that time passes, that those who have gone are gone and those who will go, which is to say every one of us, will go

For there was a moment when anything was possible


And there will be a moment when nothing is possible

But in between we can create."He accomplishes so much in so few pages, poking the most thoughtful parts of my brain and pushing me to change the way I approach life


Before reading How To Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia I would see all the people around me and feel crushed that their stories will never be told, that upon death their stories will dissipate into the air like the morning dew rising from their graves

Mohsin Hamid reminded me that everyone has a story that should be remembered

He made me want to travel the world with a butterfly net collecting stories so that peoples' lives--peoples' immense and tragic and brilliant lives--do not die with them

He made me realize that empathy is not only the fruitful consequence of good literature but also the motor of the human spirit.

$review_text.: PJV Quickie: I do enjoy reading an original story, and Jennifer Lynn Barnes usually delivers
I became a fan of the author after reading Raised by Wolves and now that fangirl status is cemented after reading Nobody


Barnes showed off her creativity with this one, because Nobody was like nothing I've read before.Review:Claire is completely ignored by everyone, even her own parents


Most people barely know she exists


She has gone through life without making a friend, or even impacting someone else's life

Her yearbook is filled with "have a nice summer" and her past is filled with memories of being forgotten and alone


Claire, though, is determined to "have a nice summer" if she has to force herself on other people
But, fate has different plans for her, because the first person that ever looks at her, really looks at her, just happens to be pointing a gun at her.Nix is what his name implies, Nobody

He is an assassin, the only thing he is good for is killing


No one notices him, he can sneak up on his prey and kill them without them even knowing he is there
He is Nobody

His latest assignment is just a girl, but she sees him
No one sees him
No one except Claire


Suddenly, Nix has something other then killing to focus on


But, the Institute that sent him to kill Claire has other plans
They want her dead...but they can't seem to see her

Just like they can't see him

Claire is Nobody? The Institute lied to Nix? What else did the Institute lie to Nix about?Hold your breath and dig in
Nobody was a very intense ride from the very beginning

Only the first few pages are within the regular structures of society...and then off we go into the world of Nobodys, Nulls and Sensors

The idea of Barnes' world that she created is that of energy

Everything gives off energy, some output energy, some take in energy, some can sense aberrations in energy


Normals give and take in a normal fashion, but some people are born different


Some give off high amounts of energy, but take back none
They are nulls


They are charming, you like them, they make you want to do things for them
Yet, they can not feel anything in return, sociopaths
You are only there to do their bidding


Nobodys are different
They can't give off energy, no one can see them or feel them
If they try hard with a lot of effort people might notice them, barely, but they are quickly forgotten

It is a harsh life


Sensors are the people that can sense Nulls and Nobodys with one or more of their senses, they make up the majority of the Institute.Sounds original, right? My thoughts exactly
I have never quite read anything like this before
Barnes delivered a spot-on creation that had me reeling from page one
One second Claire is scared for her life, the next moment she is elated because someone is actually looking at her and seeing her


It was a roller-coaster of emotions with Claire and Nix as the main characters


In one hand you pity these characters, they have such a terrible existence, but then you rejoice in them finding each other
It was quite a good interplay of emotion and characterization


I really enjoyed the story and the characters.The story-line did implement aspects of insta-love though, which I'm not a big fan

Barnes had so much story to tell, so many action sequences that the coming together of the two characters seemed like a side-thought


They were literally the only people that could see each other and they happened to be around the same age
One of those coincidental plot mechanisms that I forgave in this book, but did pop me out of the story when it got too hoaky
Barnes had them involved in an "instant attraction", they would come together and then push each other a part repeatedly, but because of it being just glanced over with more emphasis put on the background story, it didn't feel as real as the other parts of the story


You know the characters are going to get together, they are the only people that see each other (obvious), yet their insecurities keep getting in the way

It just seemed to forced at times.Besides that and a few other coincidental happenings throughout the story, I really enjoyed Nobody by Jennifer Lynn Barnes


The high-impact pace of the novel left me little time to focus on other things but the constant action
You don't want to pass this one up if you are a fan of Young Adult Paranormal novels.Recommendations:If you have read Jennifer Lynn Barnes other series, you should really enjoy Nobody

Fans of YA Paranormals should also enjoy, the romance aspect, action and paranormal elements are all indicative of the genre and should please genre lovers


If you've read and loved authors like Lisa McMann, Kiersten White and Carrie Jones you should really enjoy


Recommended for more mature teens, 15+ because of heavier subjects and some violence

There is nothing objectionable, though
The maturity of the novel can also be enjoyed by adults.Similar Young Adult Paranormal Novels you might enjoy:Mind Games  by Kiersten WhiteCrash (Visions) by Lisa McMann

The writer is only OK and much of the book is not consistant with the main Dragonlance Chronicles and Legends book.

$REVIEW.: Rachelle Fiennes is desperate to find her uncle, the only relative she has left, in the aftermath of the Battle of Stamford Bridge.  Instead, she finds a defeated Viking hiding among the corpses.  With no one to turn to and nowhere else to go, she accompanies the intriguing Tyr, praying he&#8217;s the protector she needs now that she&#8217;s all alone, and joins him back in his homeland, among the very people she&#8217;s always thought were the enemy.The Verdict...Wow.  This book is everything I love about historical romance &#8212; and so much more!  Rand brilliantly lays out detail in a way that plays out scenes in full color without losing any of the pace.Tyr is the ultimate romance hero.  He&#8217;s proud and arrogant, fearless and strong.  Yet he&#8217;s portayed with passion and vulnerability that make him utterly flawed and human.  And the way he&#8217;s described&#8230; Well, the pages heat up long before his romance with Rachelle fully blooms.  The conflict, of course, is the bitterness between his people and Rachelle&#8217;s, and there were so many times I probably should have been furious with him for the mistakes he makes in his treatment of her.  But even at his worst, he&#8217;s impossible to hate, which just goes to show how fully his character is written.Rachelle is everything I hoped she would be.  She&#8217;s particularly vulnerable, and yet she has incredible strength.  She holds onto her beliefs and withstands almost complete isolation, and it&#8217;s that fortitude that makes her irresistable to Tyr, even if it takes him a while to fully realize that.This book has it all &#8212; romance, danger, drama, and of course, two characters at odds who can&#8217;t help but fall in love with each other.  If you&#8217;re looking for characters you can fall in love with, wrapped up in a fascinating story and intriguing plot twists, this is exactly what you should be reading!***FicCentral received this book from Reading Addiction Virtual Book Tours for free in exchange for an honest review.

$review_text.: I'm very excited for this series! The first story is absolutely adorable and I love the way this author writes.Olivia is a Southern girl who is trying to get her break in Hollywood. When she lands the role as co-host of a popular home improvement show, she is torn between two guys--the one who is best for her career, not to mention drop-dead handsome (William) and the blue collared gorgeous guy who does the real work (Pete).I loved the way that Olivia met Pete--soooo funny! Of course, William really knew how to play the romance game--very suave. For me, the decision was obvious because I had my favorite guy, yet I really enjoyed the journey that Olivia went through to grow into her true self. She's getting close to 30, yet she still has valuable lessons to learn and has to do some deep soul searching.Content: no language; no violence, although the scenes describing the power tools had me laughing out loud; kissing, a scene with a scantily clad woman--implications of an intimate situation, but no details given. Clean.
$SUMMARY.: Adorable and Clean!!

$review_text.: I happened onto this book during a free promo and approached it very cautiously. You see, about five percent of the books I find for free do I actually finish--or even get beyond page fifteen. This one looked cute, however, and I was impressed with the sample text, so I settled in for a longer read. It ended up being a wonderful surprise!Within, Greg Hart is about to start seventh grade, and he's not really looking forward to it. True, he is the fastest kid in his class, but that's mainly because he's had so much practice fleeing dangers like Manny Malice. And he's got a great imagination. His journal is filled with the feats of daring he's accomplished in his own mind. That's why he thinks he's dreaming again when he's sucked into the land of Myrth.In Myrth, the people live by prophecy. Seriously, it's almost law that prophecies MUST BE FULFILLED, and the people do everything in their power to see it done. So when Greg Hart finds out he's the fabled Greghart of prophecy, the Greghart destined to slay the dragon Ruuan and rescue the princess, he's notably alarmed. But he's forced into action, accompanied by a young man by the name of Lucky. ("Oh, and I'm Lucky," the boy in orange added quickly. Greg stared at him dumbly. "Good for you." "No, I mean my name is Lucky. Short for Luke." "Actually, it's longer," Greg said.)On their journey, they meet a variety of quirky characters: Melvin, spiteful little brother to the legendary dragon-slayer, Marvin; feisty Princess Pricilla, who insists on being called Sasha and sets out to slay the dragon herself; and Bart the Bard, who has an annoying habit of singing ballads of death and destruction just before Greg heads into danger. Together they're attacked by a bollywomp, chased by falchions, and march to battle against a valley full of "razor teeth" --with Greg protesting all the way. Oddly enough, things do work out, just not at all in the way you'd expect it to.My reaction?  Sweet! (As in, I totally loved it!) This book has great characters and great action and adventure. I wasn't quite as impressed with the settings. (I felt a little bit like I was walking around on a map.) But this is truly one of the funniest books I've ever read. Not just turn-up-the-corner-of-your-smile funny, but big-toothy-grin funny, and sometimes even crack-up-out-loud funny. It's not the type of book you'd want to break open, say, in a crowd of strangers, or during a funeral, or when your teacher's lecturing. But it's great for most other times.Here are a few more of my favorite quotes:His name was Manny Malistino, only everyone called him Manny Malice, or better yet, Sir, if they thought he might be listening.Better a live coward than a dead hero, he'd (Greg) always believed."Get some sleep." Yes, of course. Wouldn't want to be tired when I'm killed by the witch."Now, would you prefer to be roasted, mauled, or eaten?" If ever there was a question that deserved to be rhetorical... "Are there any other choices?"The action, humor and word plays will appeal to the middle school crowd, though there's absolutely nothing to prevent younger ones from reading. Language and content are perfectly clean. I'd highly recommend it for ages 10+.

$REVIEW.: If this list describes you, then you must read this book


 Then find a counselor and get some help to deal with it

 It will hurt to read this book

 You will have realizations that are mind-blowing and gut-wrenching
But you will find a lot of answers for why you are the way you are


 This list is a quote from the book.* When you see a tender mother-child interaction, you are emotionally triggered

You may feel choked up and teary or push away the pain by becoming critical and dismissive

(It hurts to see what you didn't have.)* You would just as soon not look deeply into your relationship with your mother

Better to "let sleeping dogs lie."* When you visit your mother, you find yourself numbing or going into a trance state in which you are not fully present
Visits are always upsetting, and you find yourself back in painful childhood feelings.* You crave true closeness yet feel uncomfortable and afraid of it

It is unfamiliar to you.* You feel some core shame and suffer from feelings (often hidden) that there is something unlovable about you.* You avoid having children of your own, feeling somehow not quite like "parent material."Remember Bruce Willis's character in The Sixth Sense?  The realizations I had were like when he realizes at the end that he's one of the dead people

 His life flashes before his eyes in a wave of disbelief and suddenly everything makes sense


 He looks back on all the times that things were not quite right but he couldn't explain them at the time.Now, there's an explanation.

$REVIEW.: I will freely admit when I saw this title I laughed out loud and decided to explore it a little further (hey, I'm a guy!)

 Seeing as how it was a free offer that day in the Amazon Kindle store I got it and checked it out and, after reading it, I had my 4th grader read it and discussed it with my 4th grader upon completion - he enjoyed it, also.Mark Thomas does a good job of explaining bullying in school in a very humorous way, and explaining it the way he does also encourages our younger generation to read - in my case, my 4th grader didn't want to stop reading it, laughed a few times while he was reading, and before the conclusion he had a better reinforcement of not being a bully and recognizing the same.Most parents struggle with finding something that a child will enjoy reading - I'd recommend this for the entertainment factor as well as the education factor


 As I type this review, I see the Kindle pricing is $2.99 - I believe it is well worth it and recommend it!

$REVIEW.: You know when an idea is hogwash, but if you label it that, you are probably calling upon the etymological wisdom of the characters in the town of Dogpatch, Kentucky, the imaginary locale of Al Capp's long running comic strip "Li'l Abner."  They also gave us "going bananas" and the "double-whammy," but Capp's contribution to American society was far more than some catchwords.  For over forty years, "L'il Abner" was a staple of the funny papers, with branches into television, Broadway, the movies, merchandizing, and more.  Capp was terrific as a draughtsman, was generous and sympathetic to those like him who were amputees, and had a bountiful supply of funny ideas wrapping up a sometimes pointed satire.  He was also a vengeful liar, an adulterous husband, and a sexual predator.  A complicated, frustrating man who died in 1979, he has not had a full biography until now: _Al Capp: A Life to the Contrary_ (Bloomsbury) by Michael Schumacher, who has written plenty of biographies of celebrities, and Denis Kitchen, who has drawn cartoons and published other comic artists.  In a way, this fine biography has come too late; those of us who enjoyed "L'il Abner" in its heyday know that that heyday is long past, and the effectiveness of a daily comic strip is essentially restricted to its own time.  As a reminder of how influential and popular a simple comic strip could become, however, and as a warts-and-all portrait of a bustling and energetic artist, this is an enormously entertaining review.Capp was born in 1909, and when he was nine, he lost his left leg in a streetcar accident.  Throughout his life, he wrote letters or talked to kids and veterans who were amputees, extending hope; it is his most likeable trait to be found in these pages.  He bilked his way through art schools, and brought out "L'il Abner" in 1934.  Its strange and likeable characters made it eventually the most popular strip in the funnies, on Sunday always featured on the front page of the funny pages.  Capp had been a liberal Democrat until the 1960s, and pilloried Congress, McCarthy, and grasping capitalists.  The revolutions of the 1960s were to change everything.  Capp, for all his lampooning of American society, considered himself a patriot, and as such, supported the Vietnam War just as he had WWII.  He caricatured hippies as unhygienic, and he hated folksingers.  He had a sour parody of Joan Baez, Joanie Phoanie, who made buckets of cash singing "Let's Conga with the Viet Cong."  He was more angry than funny.  He became a pal of Richard Nixon, and he enjoyed going to college campuses to spout opinions he knew would make students angry.  This was to lead to his downfall.  Capp had been married for four decades, had a couple of long-running affairs and other side sexual enthusiasms.  In 1971 he tried to force himself on a twenty-year-old student, and when the story eventually got out, other students revealed that Capp had attempted the same predation.  It turns out that Goldie Hawn, Grace Kelly, and Edie Adams had been his casting-couch targets as well when "L'il Abner" was turned into a musical.  Capp absurdly proclaimed that the "New Left" was trying to smear him with such stories, but he was charged with sodomy and indecent exposure.  Nixon's special counsel, Charles Colson, tried to pressure the district attorney to drop the charges, but it didn't happen.  Capp pled guilty to a lesser charge.Capp retired his long-running strip in 1977, went into a depression fueled by drugs, and died in 1979.  He had been a ground-breaker.  His innovative satire and recurring characters were part of the American scene for decades.  A case can be made that strips like "Doonesbury" were only possible because of what Capp had done before.  At his best, Capp produced a genial humor that promoted that likeable virtue of Americans, the enjoyment of laughs at their own selves.  That sort of jollity in Capp's art seems to have been lacking in his life, a paradox nicely drawn out in this objective and detailed biography.

$review_text.: The writing does not live up to the clever premise or even the cute title of this cozy mystery.  Characterization is shallow or over-the-top, the setting is not well sketched, and the story moves around with too many two-named characters, and not enough fluidity between scenes.  By the time I reached the end of the book, I didn't care who had committed the murder.  I was just thrilled to finally be finished with it.  I was hoping for an exploration of the strengths and wonders of middle-aged friendship, with dashes of gardening lore thrown into a setting that was being steadily beautified.  Something more like Susan Wittig Albert's China Bayles series.

What you will not get is something frivolous and silly, so if you are a dilettante, you may want to pass this book up. This is serious writing for serious reading, and the scholarship is excellent, and evident by his meticulous writing, photos, and drawings. Clearly this is a subject that is of great interest to Mr. Jenkins, and to many other people too. He writes well, and he is very thorough; I really liked some of the things that he had to say, and he has produced a really terrific book on a fascinating subject. The only thing I didn't care for, was that he used this book to take pot shots at critics and other people that he disagrees with.  I liked the fact that he wrote a good, serious book, and not some silly little toss away volume.

It's a real page-turner; but my main problem was the disjointed narrative - I could be totally wrong, but there doesn't appear to be a main character. This makes it hard to really engage and sympathise with the characters, as it's not really clear whose story is being told...But it's definitely colourful and an enjoyable read.

$REVIEW.: The story had some great basics - the opening scene was exciting and the closing scenes were exciting.  Between...meh.  I did like the characters, and I will read the other books to see what happens to some of them.  I really don't care for very loooong and detailed bedroom scenes (hoping, probably in vain, that the next books are shorter in that area) and skipped page after page after page of that, as it really didn't add to the story and appeared entirely too often.  There were grammatical and word errors, but not so many that it took attention away from the story.  All in all, OK.

$REVIEW.: This is the third in the series and definitely the best. If you are a fan of books like Motorcycle Man by Kristen Ashley, then you will love this book. I'm not saying it's as good as MM, because that would be impossible. It is however one of my new favs. Seth &#34;Ghost&#34; Warren is a brilliant character and Macy is a strong female lead, far better than I thought she'd be when she was introduced in the second of the series. Her uptight ways made the relationship between the two so much fun. There is plenty of angst but there's so much more to them.... Buy this book! You won't regret it!

$REVIEW.: What a fun story and great page turner.  Kim Baldwin has written another incredible Alaskan adventure you don't want to miss.  There is so much detail that you can almost visualize being in Bettles AK.  This book is easily a stand alone book based on Kim's talent for telling a story.  Or, it can be the third of her exciting Alaskan romances.  I personally love reading about previous characters from authors earlier books.  Kim not only brings back several of her lead characters from Whitewater Rendezvous and Breaking The Ice, she has molded them into this wonderful story that enhances the excitement and intrigue of High Impact.  Oh yeah, Kim Baldwin has done it again.  I highly recommend this book.  Thanks for the lack of sleep ,Kim.  I'm ready for my own trip to AK now.  Great read!

$REVIEW.: EARLY CRIMES is a nice look at one of the best crime writers working today. Two short stories and a previously unpublished novel. These were done in his college days, the two short stories finally appearing in a small magazine of Wayne Dundee's, then one getting into a collection edited by Donald Westlake.But for me, the star is the novel, SHOOT THE MOON, Mr. Collins goes into the reasons why it never made it into book form, a shame. It's easy to see the influences here as we get a humorous tale of two young college men who streak a wedding reception to pay off a poker debt and everything that follows the two naive young men as the get involved with a apir of crooks they meet in the county jail as they serve their thirty days for the streaking incident.Things keep happening as they get hooked into a bank robbery that impede the job.great fun this one.

$review_text.: Personal combat holds a unique fascination for readers and movie viewers. There seems to be an endless number of books and movie depictions about gunfighters and sword duels. Yet the role of the knife in personal combat has largely been ignored. The author, Paul Kirchner, has remedied this omission with this volume, which as the title suggests, emphasizes the role of the bowie knife and those who have wielded it with deadly effect.It is clear that a great deal of meticulous research has gone into producing this unique volume.  This book will surely appeal to those with an interest in martial and combative matters. It should also appeal to those with an interest in history, especially social history. After reading this entertaining work I came away with a new appreciation of just how pervasive the culture of the big blade was in America's past. It is truly remarkable just how quick men of the bygone era were seek bloody satisfaction for insults and affronts received from their fellows. Kirchner's accounts makes it clear that this violence was by no means limited to the criminal class or the lower strata of society. It is surprising how many men of education and means resorted to their bowies.This work is certainly both entertaining and informative. The comprehensive scope of this work is impressive.

$review_text.: This is the first Mark Sava story I read and I could not put it down. I loved the action and adventure Dan Mayland created for his characters! Mark Sava, ex- CIA station chief of Azerbaijan; his friend John Decker, ex Navy Seal; and co-worker/girlfriend Daria Buckingham experience threats and danger as they are forced to travel through a number of countries and deal with savory characters in handling their situation. When I read the first in the series, The Colonel's Mistake, after this I already knew  the main characters and it wasn't quite as catching for me as this one was, despite it being well written and exciting. I think if I'd read them in the correct order I would have enjoyed the first one even more since the characters were being introduced and developed. I highly recommend this series - but be warned - you will not want to put it down once you start....!!

$REVIEW.: My son needs all the help he can get as it's hard out there to find work, basic life skills, college, and his dad passed away. This book provides a measure of good advice, but as someone mentioned it's a lot of recipes which I think a few basic ones would be good. What he really needs is real practical advice and information that is very accessible. When young people are under a lot of stress it's hard to overload the brain more but there are so many things they could use hand holding for. I bought several books for him, so hopefully he will find answers he needs and at least a little more self confidence knowing he is not alone. Other books I bought: Live Skills 101, Money Sucks, Where's Mom Now That I need Her.One thing my son noticed right away was that in talking about finances it suggested to be sure to set aside a certain amount to contribute to your church. That totally turned him off and when you are scraping to pay rent that is pretty offensive. How bout if the church give-ith rather than take-ith!

$review_text.: When the hyperdrive on Captain Dace's small trader ship redlines, she ejects in an escape pod and crashes alone on Dadilan, colonized several thousand years ago by humans who have since regressed to an innocent, semi-agrarian society protected by the Empire's noninterference directive

But smugglers have infiltrated the planet for "shara," a psychic boosting drug available locally, and undercover Patrol agents are also on the ground

Dace lands right in the middle of the machinations in a romp that blends space opera, medievalist fantasy and a bit romance (the Harlequin kind, not the Percy Bysshe kind) as never-been-kissed Dace finds herself unwillingly attracted to Tayvis, solo Patrol Enforcer.Clegg's first-person narration is easily readable and lightly humorous, but I wish an editor had taken a stronger hand to prevent some of the repetition in both the particulars of the narration and the capture/escape/capture/escape cycle of the plot


In fact, most of my complaints with the book rest in publisher Cyberwizard Productions' arena, from the mediocre cover art and design to the odd page layout to the lack of smart quotes in the text
(I also can't explain the title, or the subtitle "The Fall of the Altairan Empire, Book One.")

$REVIEW.: My husband read tons of reviews about this book placed by expert knitters as well as beginner knitters.  I had an old copy of a craft book that wasn't helping me learn to knit as it was from the 1950's or so and the pictures were small in the tiny section about knitting.  I was constantly on the computer looking for youtube videos etc. to answer my questions [which is a big deal for my hubby as we have one computer and he loves to mess around with it].  So he bought me this book and I literally have been reading it like a novel because it goes through everything and answers the questions that begginers would have.  And not just one way of knitting but every way of knitting is covered.  conversion charts and explinations are available and everything.  I love it!  we recently moved and i'm still unpacking so i haven't been able to find my precious knitting "bible" :( but i can't wait to read more and practice more.  I recommend this to every knitter; beginner or experienced because some day you may have to answer a question about some knitting technique and this book explains it perfectly.

$REVIEW.: The niece of real estate broker Ellen McKenzie and her husband, Mark Tortelli move to a new job in the California wine region at Silver Spring Winery.  This sparks immediate tension between Sabrina, Mark, Ellen and Ellen's current lover, Dan.  Naturally there is something odd about the reasons Mark and Sabrina have suddenly appeared on the scene.  Dan, who happens to be the chief of police, and it anxious to marry Ellen is put off by the presence of the other couple.As things progress, Sabrina and Mark arrange a dinner at the winery to introduce themselves to the community.  To do this they hire one of the most detestable chefs on the entire West Coast.  There are several other mildly and strangely odd characters in this story.  And of course there is a murder.  As these things go, you can easily image who gets killed, where the body is found and who gets accused of the murder.A classically structured traditional or "cozy" mystery that is smoothly written. The characters are carefully worked out to cover most types of individuals one might expect to find in any small community.  Both Mark and his wife, Sabrina, come with family baggage, that is relatives who are forever poking their illogical noses where they are not wanted or needed.  There are funny bits and there are poignant bits and the murder is logically solved.I cannot enthusiastically recommend the book because there is no one here with whom I really connected.  The level of angst and handwringing rises to surprising heights and in the end I was willing to suggest Ellen and Dan and the rest of the cast left standing pick up and move to the mountains.  Nevertheless, the book is well-written and well-constructed.

$review_text.: Long Road Full Speed Ahead by Emily Walker is the fictional account of one young woman's descent into hell on the wings of crystal meth. It's depressing but it's marvelously well written and has the ring of truth.Grace is ostensibly a student at college, being supported by her parents, but you'd hardly know it from the descriptions of her activities. Going to class happens exactly once in the entire novel. Instead, from morning till night, Grace goes from one sort of high to the next in an increasingly deadening ritual. Her part-time job as a waitress is punctuated by carefully planned trips to the ladies room to snort some more of her favorite drug until her jaw is grinding and her motor-mouth has gone into overdrive.Grace's focal point on the one hand is her abusive, loser boyfriend, who strings her along while endlessly hurting and demeaning her, and on the other her self-absorbed drug addict best friend Miranda, who likes "dirty sex," e.g. sex in the woods with a rotting log for a mattress. With support from people like this, Grace's plunge into a self-induced destruction is all but assured.One website I checked claimed that there were more than 12 million users of crystal meth in the United States, more than either cocaine or heroine. It is easier to manufacture than those drugs, and just as addictive. Have a look on the internet for before-and-after pictures of users, and I suppose you yourself will never use.But the fact remains a lot of people are falling victim to this drug, seduced by a lifestyle of least resistance and maximum high. Emily Walker has sketched this world with a devastating and haunting portrait that will make an indelible mark on you.

She also likes to do things her way and doesn't like to be bossed around. To bad someone didn't get the memo. But then someone kidnaps her friend and she will do anything to get her back. She'll even ask her ex lover for help is she has to. In a race against time she has to find the arrows to save her friend, confront her feeling for Harrison, and find out that sometimes your enemies came becomes friends. Oh and not to mention the gods and goddesses breathing down everyone's necks.What a thrill ride. This was a book that I wouldn't normally find myself reading. I usually read paranormal and all that. So this book was a little bit out of my comfort zone. Well let me just say that I'm glad I stepped out of it. This book was great. There was plenty of action and the characters were very relatable......with being in there situation of course. Mia comes on a little strong but that what made me like her. I don't think I would have liked this book without Mia. This had plenty of action and it was not lacking in any area. There was danger, lots of tomb raiders, gods and goddesses, and of course hot guys. LOL and what's a book without danger and trust me Mia likes danger. :DMia- she was a firecracker. She did not need anyone fighting her battles for her. No she is the type of woman who takes things into her own hands. She doesn't get close to people often but when she does she cares about them deeply. She is the kind a person you don't want on your bad side. I can see me and her being great friends. LOLHarrison- "He has a stick entrenched up his butt" as Mia would say. LOL Yes, I toned it down a bit LOL While he was like this most of the book, I still liked him. He was just so yummy. He liked Mia but didn't approve of what she does. So he left her. All I can say is that is a two way street. He could have changed to...just saying. All that being said he still cares about her and that's what made me love him the most.Overall fans of Indiana Jones and Laura Croft Tomb Raider will love this book.3.5 STARS

$REVIEW.: I'll start by saying that I'm one of those people who believes in the power of the universe...that people are put in your life for a reason, and that the energy and desires you put out into the world, will eventually come back to you.Nina believed in the universe and its ability to both please her and hurt her. Without giving too much away, she's experienced trauma. She's been damaged and unfortunately for her, not looking for anyone to repair that damage.Enter Connor. Sweet, adorable, dreamy Connor...with eyes of sapphire that she could gaze into for hours. The kind of eyes you get lost in and that sweep all of your troubles away."He says my name like he's tasting it and by the look on his face, I taste pretty good."They begin a friendship that eventually turns to something more. He not only stirs something inside of her, but soon he begins to help her see that she just might be able to trust her heart again.'Why? How could this time possibly be different from the others?' I throw my arms up in the air in frustration and I immediately lose my balance and start to teeter on the thin edge of my blades. Connor grabs both of my arms and holds me in place, steadying me. My eyes make their way to his and he reaches one hand out to brush a stray hair from my vision and tucks it behind my ear. 'It's different , because this time I'm here to catch you' He whispers.'Unfortunately, Connor has his own demons and in his own way is running. I won't say anything else about this except that you'll have to read the story to find out more.Connor and Nina not only begin a journey of discovery, but they save each other in more ways than one.I also loved Nina's best friend Lo. She helped to ground her and she's the type of friend that everyone needs to not only support, but give you that dose of reality when you need it most.This story is filled with drama, action, romance, swoon, and steam. Devon Herrera brings us a novel filled with lots of surprises! All I can say is if you like to be surprised and you believe in the power of love, READ THIS BOOK!!!

$REVIEW.: This novel was very interesting for me. I got a good sense of place and always felt like I was in San Francisco, learning something new from the surroundings. It's got lots of great twists in the book and the initial setup of the crime and pacing were excellent.I will watch out for Hilborne's next novel. Will it be standalone or will Mac Jackson be back? Either way I'm sure it will be a good read if Madness and Murder is anything to go by.

$review_text.: My Review:I don't read as many college-setting books as I used to, but this book reminded me why I love them so much.Jake is a junior in college majoring in a degree he has no interest in, doing what his father has always pushed on him


He knows that this may be his last chance to do something just for him, so he applies to live in the artistic dorm...and is surprisingly accepted

Danny was on his acceptance board and was vital to Jake's acceptance
As a result, Danny agreed to take Jake in as his roommate.At the beginning of the story Jake is an uptight guy, but that definitely changes throughout the course of the book
That was a fun transformation to watch...and seeing him find his place in this group of friends was nice


Of course, at the same time, he's also coming to terms with exactly who he is sexually

He's never admitted it to anyone else besides himself, but Jake is gay


As he gets more comfortable with his out and proud gay roommate, they begin to experiment


But Danny has secrets and knows that they have to keep this purely about sex because once Jake learns the truth, he won't want to have anything resembling a relationship with Danny.This book covers a whole year in these characters' lives

It was interesting to see the different family dichotomies...which are so completely opposite
My heart just hurt for Jake and the issues with his father and brothers


But I also felt a bit of anger at his mom that she didn't step up more to protect him


Then there's Danny's secrets...*gah* what he went through is every person's nightmare when they put themselves out there hoping to find that special someone


He made bad choices, but it was easy to understand his young 17 yo reasoning and see how ended up in that place.I liked and enjoyed the story of Jake and Danny's romance, but even more I liked the whole backdrop of this dorm and this circle of friends

It was fun to watch Jake settle into the uncomfortableness of coed bathrooms and his sexuality and coming out
The book is set in 1996 and I wouldn't have guessed that there was so much to set that time frame apart, but the author did a great job of all those little details, from the D&D; games to the music and TV shows at the time.This is one of those books that left me with a smile on my face


Simply a fun, entertaining read.

$REVIEW.: Consumed (Fantasy's Bar and Grill #3) by Michelle Hughes5 out of 5 Stars!!!!In the third installment to the Fantasy's series, love blossoms and tempers flare as the battle of wills rage on between Zoey and her four guys!!!!! After Zoey had experienced the four men together and separately, she was forced to make a decision that was nail-chewing at its finest!! Her inner turmoil was very well written and the verbiage made it easy to believe that I was actually inside her head as opposed to Michelle's.I will forever be in awe of the amount of smoking hot, panty soaking, need a fan HOTNESS that is contained within these covers (whether it be physical covers or digital ones). And the simple fact that there is a story packed into such a quick read that goes deeper than boy-meets-girl-boy-bones-girl makes it even better. In Consumed, we see deeper into the dynamics of not only the characters but their relationships as well. I know that the more I read about Miles and his tender, loving, easy going self, the more I wonder if there is a real life version out there!!!I still saw several grammatical issues but, this time, with the detail that was packed into these pages and the ease with which I painted my pictures, I easily did my mental autocorrect and went on about my merry business and continued drooling over the four gorgeous hunks we have grown to love.And Amber.....Sweet,innocent Amber.....I would love to see more of her evolution into her sexuality. I feel as if that in and of itself would offer a very promising tale! We shall see!!!!!*Honest review given in exchange for a complimentary copy of this book.*Meagan, My Secret Book Spot

$REVIEW.: Flash like many dc comics of the early sixties were alot of fun and often filled with extreme fantasy elements. Nowadays the comics are more serious , and that's ok but I still say why not throw is a wild story about flying killer clouds?. Mostly though many good villians are in these pages. And that's one area where the silver age was better than the golden age. the golden age had far too few costumed villians around~! Not to worry here though. Captain boomerrang and captain cold , the mirror master and others are ready to challenge the flash. Carmien infantinos art is really excellent here, among the best he ever did. Some of his panels are just awesome. And his storyteling is masterful. John broome writes up a storm of fantsy stories here too. The newer flash is more powerful than the old one for sure but he still is fun. These stories are around in the flash chronicals paperback for a smaller price too. however the hardcovers are better for sure. This stuff remains fun and fantasy driven. Marvel would add more pathos to comics but d.c. had nothing to be ashamed of here with this family friendly stories.

$REVIEW.: I enjoyed the first two novels in R. Scott Bakker's "Prince of Nothing" series -- his weaving of action, humor, sex, and metaphysics into a fully-realized alternate universe demonstrated astounding dexterity and full-fledged commitment to his story.  I can't imagine the permutations this story must have gone through as Bakker wrestled with a plot that was truly epic in scope, not to mention his philosophical, slightly archaic diction.I eagerly dove into "The Thousandfold Thought," anxious to see how Bakker was going to wrap up this announced trilogy.  In some respects, the plot of "TTT" is straightforward:  the otherworldly Prince of Nothing, Kellhus, has led the Holy War to the threshold of its goal -- the plains outside the city of Shimeh.  What ensues is, for approximately the last 20% of the novel, a battle between invader and invaded that rivals anything since the Battle of the Pellenor Fields from Tolkien's "Return of the King."  It's hard to say who is more terrifying -- Bakker's battle-hardened human soldiers or their sorcerer allies.  Nobody writes a more powerful, more dazzling battle scene than Bakker, and that's high praise indeed.But much of "TTT" is given over to metaphysical debate as Kellhus confronts his father, the sorcerer Drusas Achamian confronts the truth of Kellhus and his love for his former wife Esmemet (now Kellhus' lover), and the barbarian Cnaiur confronts his former lover and tormentor.  Plus, "minor" characters plot, scheme, and kill as they seek to twist the Holy War to their own ends.To be honest, I am not all that interested in philosophy, so much of the metaphysical stuff Bakker obviously adores was lost on me.  Bakker writes it well, but I am not the correct audience.  I liked it fine, but it's not the kind of stuff I'm going to eagerly revisit, and it made much of "TTT" pretty slow going.Much of the humor found in the first two books in this series is absent from "TTT," as the major players are moved to peaks of triumph and despair in the midst of war.  There's naturally not much room for levity.  That's unfortunate, but it's not a weakness.  "TTT" is just a weightier tome than the first two novels.Bakker takes the interesting step of ending his trilogy with what is essentially a cliff-hanger.  Does he intend to keep the story alive?  He's got more than a few plot threads left to tie up.  Or does he want the reader to puzzle over their own interpretation of these plot threads (such as, what's going on with the bird-with-the-human-head, what happens to Cnaiur, etc.).  That would be a daring choice considering all the work that went into this trilogy.Ultimately, I admire the "Prince of Nothing" series more than I enjoy it.  I don't shun complexity, but this series is the first one I've really wanted to finish where the third novel starts out with dozens of pages summarizing what happened in the first two novels, and attaches 100 pages of expository appendices to the end.  Again, Bakker has created a complex world populated with a staggering cast of characters and with its own extensive history -- I'm sure his world's version of the "Silmarillion" is out there just waiting to be published.  And I'd probably check it out.Not for the faint of heart, the "Prince of Nothing" series is probably better suited for armchair reading than the stairmaster at the gym -- you're going to need the time and the energy to work through Bakker's complex stories.  And in the end, it's worth it.

$review_text.: I always know I'm going to get a great story when I read a book written by author Kelly Jamieson and of course, I did with her newest release, Rhythm of Three. This is the sequel to Rule of Three where we first met Kassidy, Chris and Dag and now, we get to see what their lives have been like after they've decided to be in a committed m&eacute;nage relationship.I enjoyed that the author let us see the obstacles these three have to face and the compromises they each have to make in order to make their relationship work. Chris faced the dilemma of having to inform his conservative parents about not only being in a m&eacute;nage relationship, but also being in love with his best friend, Dag. Chris has had a more difficult time adjusting to this new relationship since he never saw himself being in love with another man. I liked how Chris took his time to try to understand his feelings and ultimately how he ended up handling it.Kassidy had her own decision to make about letting her friends and family know about her relationship with both men. She also had to face Chris' parents' reaction and the consequences that followed after their revelation. Another issue this threesome faced and had to compromise on was about money. Chris and Kassidy did not want to be financially dependent on Dag, who had no qualms about wanting to help out and pay for things since he was wealthy.I adored Dag the most in this story because he had always been in love with Chris but unable to reveal his true feelings for fear of rejection. He was also the one coming into Chris and Kassidy's established relationship as a couple and turning their dynamics in a whole new direction. I loved how true to himself he was and how far he would go to defend Chris, Kassidy and their relationship. I loved all three of them together, the sex was hot and I rooted for them to get their happy ending.The author knows how to create a great story with the right amount of obstacles for a couple, in this case, a threesome to overcome and some steamy sex scenes to get readers emotionally invested and wanting more. I could not stop reading and my only wish was it would've kept on going on and on.

$review_text.: Demitri Howard is an ex-con turned successful movie producer thanks to the books he penned while incarcerated.  He never thought he would live amongst the elite Hollywood society, but has now become accustomed to having the finer things in life.  Demitri knows he is blessed and does not forget where he came from.  With an unsuccessful relationship with the woman he loves, he moves on and eventually finds fulfillment in the daughter that surprisingly enters his life.In the midst of his happiness, a night out with his friends is tragically turned into a murder scene that catapults him into a series of events that he is able to tie back to connections from his past.  Tempted to go back into street mode, Demitri has to carefully think of a way to use his power to unearth the details of what has already occurred while attempting to keep this from harming his family and friends any further.There are so many different story lines in this book and I wanted to keep track of them all.  There were a few editing flaws, but nothing to diminish the effectiveness of the story.  After not finishing this book until well after midnight, I immediately began part two to find out how the story progressed.  There was no way I could have gone to sleep peacefully considering how this title ended.  Kelvin did a great job in coercing the reader to continue the journey with Demitri and all the other characters!

$REVIEW.: Dan and Serena have moved to this North Carolina town after They suffer a series of losses.  Serena's father had died, and their relationship is one of the most cogent of the book.  Having convinced his Jewish family to leave Germany in 1936, he raises Serena to be ready to flee and to keep things of value with her in order to effect the flight.  He happens to have died after a phone argument.  Dan's brother has died, his only link to the secrets and the traumas of childhood.After Serena charges jewelry to her employer's charge account, she is fired and the couple end up in Waring after depleting all their resources.  There aren't many Jews in Waring.  The couple has lost connection with each other, casualties of their responses to their loss.  These passages are beautifully articulated, succeeding in the difficult job of making the reader understand each person's perspective while realistically showing how they are mysteries to each other.Serena turns to a flailing tiny synagogue with a questionable rabbi for safety.  Dan in the same motivation seeks to bury himself in the mainstream, away from the identity of outsider Jewish New Yorker.  The drift that these choices engender is tenderly drawn.  The reality of being the first new that many people have met is written with clarity and without drama.  If there  is any shortcoming, it is the inevitability of the roles of the rabbi and the scoutmaster.I do like this book.  The struggles of a marriage in which the partners suddenly fail to understand each other are etched carefully.  I really liked the portrayal of grief as it acts in each of us distinctly.  The town is described with great care.  The rabbi and the scoutmaster are explicated with inevitability but also with great insight.  The subtle and not so subtle anti- Semitism of people distrustful of the "other" is masterfully drawn without recourse to unnecessary drama.  The portrayal of bigotry without recourse to stereotypes is a tricky task, but I feel the author succeeded.  In summary, this book portrays the separateness within each of us and the struggle to establish connection.  I recommend it.

$REVIEW.: You have two tanks. One has far superior catalog specs: much better gun, comparable speed, and more armor. You want to say that the other tank is the better one anyway. How would you argue such a thing?In this book, the author makes such a stab, and generally comes off being pretty effective. He gives due credit to the Panthers better gun and armor, but points out how its reliability problems and limited range cuts that advantage to the point that overall it is the less *operationally* effective tank. He also points out how the weak side armor and relative inexperience of the Panthers made them less than invulnerable to the technotactically inferior Soviet tank forces.However, the book might have benefitted from a couple of things:1a) Occasionally, the author seems to be a little hasty in his conclusion. For example, the Panther consumes nearly 4 times as much fuel as the T-34. According to the statistics he provides, the Panther consumes twice as much on a road and over four times as much on cross country, so on average that would seem reasonable. However, the suspiciously low difference between the T-34's road and cross-country fuel consumption leads one to wonder whether the specific assumptions set for "cross-country" is simply 'easier' in Russia than in Germany.(Indeed, a similar suspiciously low ratio is written in the &#1056;&#1091;&#1082;&#1086;&#1074;&#1086;&#1076;&#1089;&#1090;&#1074;&#1086; &#1087;&#1086; &#1084;&#1072;&#1090;&#1077;&#1088;&#1080;&#1072;&#1083;&#1100;&#1085;&#1086;&#1081; &#1095;&#1072;&#1089;&#1090;&#1080; &#1090;&#1072;&#1085;&#1082;&#1072; &#1058;-34 (Guide to Material Part of Tank T-34), but where cross country might have been is written &#1075;&#1088;&#1091;&#1085;&#1090;&#1086;&#1074;&#1086;&#1081; &#1076;&#1086;&#1088;&#1086;&#1075;&#1077; (dirt road) - I think most people would think "cross-country" will involve at least moving over grass.)1b) Not that all this goes the Panther's way, though. As a counterexample, he mentions that the Russian 9R radio doesn't work well on the move, while the German Fu 5 apparently (by omission) does not have this problem. This is supposed to be a point for the Panther I guess. On the other hand, according to Russian Tanks of World War II, Stalin's Armored Might, the 9R's 'catalog spec' range is 24km, while its real effective range on move is 8km. With a 2/3rd range reduction, the statement that the 9R "does not function well on the move" is defensible, but the Fu 5's (aka FuG 5) range *stopped*, using the *telegraph* is 4km! Even the command tank's FuG 6/13 is only 8km (telegraphic) and while German command tanks have still longer range radios, they now work on different frequency ranges and are thus presumably rather useless in contacting subordinate tanks (I might also add the FuG 8's voice range, while stopped, is apparently only 20km). So who has the better external communications is much less clear and can be discussed more thoroughly (yes, space is thin on an Osprey book but I see half a blank page on P.36 - and I'll gladly trade off that B/W image there for a more thorough discussion).2) Further, sometimes briefly adding a couple of exterior points of reference will have been helpful to our understanding. For example, we can definitely understand the German training was *better*, but how bad was the Soviet one by WWII standards? They were given 3 rounds and a drum of machinegun ammo to fire, which we are obviously supposed to conclude is plain poor. On the other hand, if you believe Beale's Death by Design, he suggests that WWII British tankers get broadly similar allocations for their training (4 rounds and 2 belts of MG ammunition, and not even on the type of gun they would use in action). So, how bad is it really by WWII standards?Despite these small flaws, the book's tenet is well argued and it'll be a valuable addition to most tank buff's library.(10-3-2014: Hadn't actually changed anything, but for some reason Amazon changed my pen name to "Amazon Customer" - let's see if an edit would bring it back).

The sex is HOT and so is the couple, and not just their bodies. Their banter is both funny and sexy--I could have done with a whole book of their tit-for-tats. The second half of the book slowed a bit, but it never wavered from its likability of the characters. Beat of the Heart is a fun and sexy read and perfect as a stopover after reading an emotional book. [4.5/5 stars]

In this book, I still love Max's character but not so much Cameron.  I think the author was trying to create an assertive woman in Cameron's character, but she just came off bitchy with no common sense.  I feel like there could have still been danger but maybe Cameron didn't need to walk her high heels right into it on every turn.  Still good but not a great book.

$review_text.: This book is extremely useful for authors who are trying to promote their own books. The author has obvious media experience and most of her advice is really sound. Take her advice on reviews and media releases-- she's right on the money.The only major drawback I saw was that this book doesn't give us any examples of what a media release should look like when it's put together. I think that if the author was going to focus the book so much on media releases and stuff like that, it would not have been a big deal to add a few PDF or JPEG images of sell sheets, media releases, etc.Dan Poynter gives examples in his books and I thought they were really helpful. Other than that, I think the book is still a good buy, since so many other how-to guides out ther just gloss over the media and publicity component and focus on useless things.Conclusion: Reccommended

$review_text.: This book is thoroughly researched although much of the detail is uninteresting or unnecessary
The Titanic information is actually too scarce for the enthusiast or historian, and little is added about second-class life
The author misses the significance of Albert Caldwell's survival: that a second-class male passenger was least likely to survive of any category of passenger
Also, there is quite a bit of conjecture about events that occurred on board Titanic as the author is clearly writing from memory rather than interview
Not a bad book, but would have been better as a shorter e-book than a full-fledged manuscript

Would read more from this author, though.

I have the anthology and this is my favorite story in the book

I was very excited to get the kindle version of my favorite


I usually avoid historical rom and really love paranormal rom, but even though this is historical and not really a paranormal one; I still love it


This is a short story, but does a good job of giving you all the details that are relevant to the plot
The heroine is spunky and is not a typical young lady of the time


The hero is strong and intelligent, but currently lost as to what his future holds

There was some excitement, a little action, a small mystery (at least for the hero), lots of humor and a lightly steamy romance (no actual sex takes place "on screen").

Read this after Summon Lyght-Book 4*Tyler, the human boy rescued with Kassie in Summon Lyght, metaphysically enters an alternate universe, the Dark Grondaia while demons are fighting for his soul. A Keeper of Darkness (she pretty much has the job of being a &#34;cop&#34; and keeping the demons in line) saves him with a sacrifice of herself. She (Delphinus) takes him home, but at the cost of her &#34;job&#34;. She's now considered human, and Tyler is no longer a teenage boy.In addition to meeting Delphinus, we also meet Zool's spirit companion, Kcearn who take the form of a panther, and really isn't keen on changing to a human just yet. Yet...Zool is equally as stubborn, perhaps even more so. He's absolutely convinced he can find a tame woman, or tame one himself. Men, they're the same no matter what the species...LOLTina is my kind of woman! She won't take any crap from anyone, angel or otherwise. Zool's a physical warrior, but to Hell if he can come to terms with how to deal with human emotions (or other things humans deal with). Tina's pretty much the same way. Oh how I love that she truly is his equal. Thing is, Zool knows it, too...This is a close up/bridge book after Summon Lyght (book 4) and before the bridge book 4.2 Dark Games.

$review_text.: This book was a struggle for me. I like fantasy, but not so much this kind of fantasy. I like learning about the culture of the fantasy world, and Mr. Schiller seemed rather reluctant to focus much on those issues. Many times the characters seemed to be moderns with a veneer of 'My Lord' and 'illiterate peasant' added.The story moved along well enough, but the motivations (IMO) kept getting mixed up. It is a very hard thing when someone you love does something you hate. It is also hard to portray those emotions.The lead character kept bouncing back and forth between accepting and rejecting Christ, which I found hard. I like reading about growth.Even considering all that I say above and below, I would (indeed have) let my children read this book. And discuss it with me afterwards.Age Level: The language and issues involved shouldn't prevent even a fairly young child who could separate fact from fantasy from reading this book, or having it read to them.Theology: Mennonites will dislike the emphasis on physical violence as part of the Christian temperament. I am no Mennonite, so I found that part refreshing. I had more of an issue with the Charismatic like emphasis on supernatural leadings and strength, as opposed to Scriptural knowledge and wisdom via obedience.I found this book difficult from an Orthopraxis standpoint. It is always difficult to know what about the characters represents the authors view of what should be, vs sin in their lives. Thus this list may include items that the author himself disagrees with:1) The fathers in the book seemed to be denigrated. Except for one who was dead, and plays no role in the story, all of the fathers seem to be portrayed as negative, domineering, useless, or distant. At one point a Barons daughter mentions that her father would likely `banish' her for the crime of sneaking down into the jail to visit a prisoner who is out of favor. (One wonders just where her chaperone is.)2) The book presents a very modern view, and very unChristian view, of sexual ethics. The heroes mother is shown as an adulteress, whose regret at that act seems to be more in regards to the ambiguous position it placed her son in rather than any consideration of the morality of the act itself.The most heroic and `Christian' character (not the protagonist) `falls in love' with a woman who is, at the time, not a Christian. And both he and the protagonist seem to have no qualms about physical affection prior to marriage or betrothal. With no real explanation a woman that the protagonist had been physically intimate with (short of coitus, at least that isn't mentioned) goes an marries someone else.3) Except for obedience to the Spiritual claims of Christ obedience plays no real role in the book. Characters are shown being disobedient to, and disrespectful of, authorities placed in their life both by God and human authorities, and no consequences seem to flow from those practices. They are neither adequately disciplined by their authorities nor are any negative consequences arranged by the author.

The only real problem that I have with it is the heroes are hyenas
When I think hyenas I see the bad guys in Lion King or the ones I've seen on nature shows that don't show them in a very good lite


And the noises they make, euw
I can't help but wonder how the author came up with that as being the heroes

I loved the guys themselves, I just tried not to think of them as hyenas
I'm looking forward to the next book in this series, I'll just have to focus on the guys again.

$REVIEW.: At once fascinating and deeply disturbing, Farrell's initial foray into secret Nazi weapons research and its post-war survival is several cuts above much &#34;conspiracy&#34; fare on a couple of levels.  For one thing, Farrell is not only intellectually curious, he is highly educated, VERY well read, and able to present dense subject matter in a way that is well-organized, cogent, and engagingly written.  If only he could afford a proofreader.  Or a bibliography.  Still, all kidding aside, he is always careful to at least cite his sources and if he sometimes stretches his case to the breaking point, he certainly bases his arguments on enough actual evidence and logical rigor to create a persuasively plausible case for the profoundly unsettling scenario he lays out in this and many other books.I won't go into any details--don't want to spoil the fun of discovery--but I think this book will appeal not only to the &#34;conspiracy&#34; crowd, but to a much wider audience, dealing as it does with modern military history, WWII, UFOs, scientific research, geopolitics at the end of one war and the beginning of another colder one, and most importantly how all this affects our world today.I don't know if Farrell is right about everything he says--is anyone?--but it sure as hell makes for a good read.  I would have given this five stars but for the incredibly shoddy editing and dismal illustrations.

$REVIEW.: I was a bit hesitant about this book because I don't usually read war based anything, but it was flash fiction short stories and the media kit that Katey sent with her request for an honest review was incredibly professional. I knew I shouldn't pass up the opportunity to see what this young writer was up to. I was not disappointed, in fact, this is one of the best books I have read! The many reviewers before me have talked about what the stories are about and how wonderful the writing is and I agree with all of them. My favorite points are how real the character's perspectives were. The whole thing is crafted without the influence of author intrusion that would have made the stories biased in one way or another. Both traits of an exceptionally talented writer. I also noticed other reviewers talked about how on point everything she wrote was, from reviewers that read a lot of war based fiction and from reviewers with their own experiences where Ms. Schultz had none, but certainly did her due diligence to create this masterpiece. Overall, it's the perfect balance between creativity and research.I imagine that most human beings have some type of connection to war at some point in history or another and the lack of a connection is potentially more the exception than the rule, it's sad to say. Flashes of War is a must read, regardless of genre preferences. Many only really know what the media shares about war, what history tells us, what family or friends talk about, and so on; these stories let the reader into the head of the point of view characters like no camp fire story or news story ever can. This is not a typical read about war, this is unique and brilliant!My only complaint is that it was all too short, but that's why I tend to avoid flash fiction in general, holding out for a longer read. I would have made a mistake and robbed myself of this wonderful read though. I have this author on my watch list now, while the stories drew me in but left me wanting, it was the author's skill that I'm sure will be present in everything she writes, that actually made me feel as I read every word. As you decide if this purchase is right for you, definitely look up the author to see how she has immersed her entire lifestyle into her work and how she researches her writing projects to fully understand how much she invests in every word to ensure the reader's enjoyment. Her website tagline, "writer @ large" is perfect and a testament of her dedication to the craft!

$REVIEW.: This is definitely becoming one of my all time favorite Series. I love Kylie Scott's writing style. Her books just flow effortlessly and are fairly quick reads, but you don't miss anything. She for sure doesn't drag anything out, which I love. Her books are just the right mix of romance and drama. Yes she has some issues for her characters to overcome, but I love that the resolutions are quick and don't drag out the story. She also has a knack for creating musicians that are so yummy!!!! They are just the right mixture of Alpha and sweet. Play is the second book in the Stage Dive Series and I thought it was just as great as Lick (Book 1). I loved this story for different reasons then book 1. This book had me laughing out loud so many times, but I also swooned and got angry at times too. I love how Kylie's stories get right to the point. Each of her books jump right into the story without the drawn out back story. Don't get me wrong we also get the character development and storyline development, but she does a great job at spreading it out over the course of the book.Play is about Mal (Malcolm..the drummer) and Anne. We met Mal in Lick and I completely fell in love with him in that book, but this book just made my love for him grow even more. Malcolm is one of those characters you have a hard time taking seriously and that some people might find annoying, but i found him completely endearing. He was goofy, but he was also loyal and truly wore his heart on his sleeve. Now he also had somewhat of a temper and when things didn't go his way he had a habit of running. He didn't like to open himself up to anyone. It was great seeing him change throughout the book, in thanks to Anne. Anne was also a great character....yes I thought she was kind of a doormat through the book....she really let people take advantage of her kind heart. She also had a hard time trusting people and believing in love, all because of her mom and the past. To say she was shy and reserved would be an understatement. It was great watching her open up, in thanks to Mal. He really showed her how to let loose and not to take things so seriously. These two really were opposites attract and boy could they heat up the sheets (or break a bed ;) )So if you are looking for a musician based love story that is funny, sweet and not overwrought with unnecessary drama, then this is the book for you. I would definitely recommend this book/series to everyone.

$review_text.: As with all of Caris Roane's stories, she finds a very unique way of projecting vampires and their ability. In this short story, they live among common human beings but own amulets that people come to them for when they are in need. Thea comes to Gabriel so she can use the amulet of Healing on her mother. But there's more going on here - they both have passion in mind for each other but have to battle some Mage Vampires to get to the amulet. This leads to some steamy scenes and some great vampire abilities that are very unique to the worlds that Caris creates. If you like paranormal romance, you'll like this!

$review_text.: We all feel down and out at times

 This is a far reaching book into the depths of our observatory nature

 What is meant by awakening or enlightenment?  It's not always really clear when the author keeps reiterating the fact that 'nothing matters'


 However, 'in the end' what matters is that we search for the positive aspects of living Life

 There are some very significant lines in this book that I will certainly take away with me, too
For instance:When the bird has flown, the essence of its song is often mislaid, and then all we are left with is an empty cage.By letting go our fascination with the extraordinary and spectacular, we can allow ourselves to recognize the simple wonder that lies within the ordinary.We are hardly ever at home.When I look back at my life as openly as possible, I see how I have attracted to me the people, the events, and teh pattens that have been perfectly appropriate to the kinds of influences and images that my particular belief systems have been expressing.And yes...there IS more because that's the way it &quot;is&quot;.

$REVIEW.: Great for reading while curled up under a blanket on a cold fall or winter day.Lucinda Soto is the Maitre d' at her father-in-law Sidney's restaurant. When she shows up for work one day, she enters the kitchen where her daughter, Ariana, is hanging out cooking with her father-in-law...and Colin!Years ago, Lucie dated rich-boy Colin Murriere.  When he ended their relationship in a less-than kind manner, she fell into the arms of her good friend Rob Soto. Unfortunately, she suffered greatly at Rob's hand - to the point of it almost costing the lives of her and her daughter. Widowed several years now, she works at the Gull and Oar and attends college to secure the future of her and her daughter.Colin has recently won a cooking reality show, and used the winnings to buy the 5-star Gull and Oar from Sidney, who wants to retire and move to Florida.  Lucie is the girl he couldn't forget, and he looked for her for a long time, never suspecting she married.  Having found her, he intends to make her his again.Lucie has never forgiven Colin for the way he dumped her.  She admits she even cheered for his opponent on the cooking show, which she and her daughter watched regularly.  Ariana, on the other hand, cheered for Colin.Ariana, proclaimed by her grandfather to be his best sou chef, is disappointed when her mom tells her she can no longer hang out at the restaurant after school.  She knows her mom does not like Chef Colin, but no one will tell her why.  She is determined, after Colin tells her they once dated, that they belong together.  She needs to find a way to get them back together so Colin can be her new daddy!The story is not a very long one, but since Colin and Lucie have a history, it works. I was able to relate to and like the characters.  It was a nice ending to an unrequited love.  This is only the second work by this author I have read, but I have LOVED both of them so far.  This, in my mind, is a sign of more good things to come.
$SUMMARY.: A sweet read!

$REVIEW.: Peter is perfectly right with his introduction to the book - "Let me tell you a little about who I think you are: You're a web professional who's been hand-coding HTML and CSS (...)". This sentence, probably, describes most of the home grown HTML developers around the world. If you are working with CSS and you want to know what to expect when it comes to CSS3 this book sound to be quite useful. Peter goes over the features of CSS3 while at the same time presenting them in a structured way. He discuses particular rule, shows examples of the usage, and, at the end of each chapter, summarizes their support within most commonly used web engines: WebKit, Firefox, Opera, and IE. You will find this list again within appendix - this way you can easily check whether particular feature is missing or not within given Web browser.When it comes to the content, it turned out that I am really a casual user of CSS. There are many rules that I was not aware of. This way, I was able to learn new stuff. On the other hand, I think that material is quite demanding for the reader. As Peter states at the beginning of the book: "The Book of CSS3 helps you leverage the excellent knowledge you have of CSS2.1 in order to make learning CSS3 easier. I won't explain the fundamentals of CSS". This is true indeed. You have to have the knowledge of basics in order to benefit from the book. I suggest getting some other position that will teach you CSS from the scratch before targeting this one. What I can definitely say about the book is it's style. It suits me. Peter simply focuses on the matter itself. However, keep it mind that book is not for a beginners.

Who doesn't dream of striking it big some day and winning the lottery.  This is Angela's story and how it changed her life.  One thinks that if they had lots of money they would be happy.  In Heather Wardell's story about Angela you learn of the trials and tribulations of winning it big.  There is some truth to the saying that money is the root of all evil.  I don't want to spoil anything but this is a book that once you pick it up you won't want to put it down. I'm sure I will be reading more of Heather Wardell's books!

We have seen Thomas fight his feelings for Eddie over the series becasue he thinks Eddie is straight. We get to see Eddie struggle with the realization that he is gay. How will his sister and co-workers react to him telling them he is gay, He lets his worries keep him from happiness. In the edn I was so proud of both of my boys.

$review_text.: This recipe book has some great qualities, but there are some issues that would make it less appropriate for someone without a lot of cooking experience.On the plus side, there are a wide variety of recipes using various meats, and quite a wide selection of vegetarian dishes.  It has a good introduction on slow cooker techniques and various tips throughout the book, such as what cuts of meat or what types of beans work well.  Each recipe starts out with the size of slow cooker the recipe is designed for, and overall cooking time, along with any "do this after 4 hours" so you won't be half-way through a recipe and discover you need to add something later on and you won't be there to do so!  She also describes how to adjust recipes to be used in a different size cooker.The book includes sections on drinks and dips, breakfast, main dish salads & sandwiches, soups, beef, poultry, stews, sides and veggies, and the last section covers pasta, polenta, and rice.The index is quite thorough and helpful, listing recipes by name, main ingredient, and type of dish.  My only complaint about the index is it would be helpful to have a little more indenting, especially noticable in the "M" entry which stretches over 1 pages.Now for some problems.  Several of the "Breakfast" dishes take 3 to 4 hours to cook.  Granted those are mostly egg-type dishes that would probably be great for brunch.  Fortunately there are some that you could toss in the cooker at bedtime.I made the recipe for Turkey Chili Mac on page 233.  The directions said to heat some olive oil in a skillet over medium high heat, then add chopped onions and minced garlic and cook until soft, around 5 minutes.  Well I knew that cooking garlic on anything more than medium heat is likely to burn it, so I just added the garlic after 4 minutes, and it browned up in about a minute.  I also needed to add more liquid to the recipe; fortunately I saved the juice from the canned chopped tomatoes so I tossed that in there.  So I'm somewhat reserved about the other recipes; I wonder if the recipes were tested by others.Overall, I look forward to trying several more recipes from this book.

$REVIEW.: This is the best book I've read this year!I am a housewife who's favorite pass time is reading. I usually read around 3-4 books a week. I guess I read so much that it's hard for me to find a book that moves me, so I usually only write reviews if a book is really bad or really good. I have to say that When it Rains is probably the best book I've read in months! I can't remember the last time I teared up over a book, but When it Rains had me &#34;raining&#34; tears! I had to keep a package of tissues beside me because I cried so much the words on the page would blur! My husband was even extra nice to me for a couple of days because he kept seeing me cry! Lol. This book was so emotional. It was a page turner with unexpected twists, heartache for all the characters, and other than a few very minor typos was beautifully written. The book will show you what it's really like for women who have been through a particular situation, how many women handle it, how quickly life can change, how there are people out there who can overlook their own problems to help another, that there are people in this world who can change your life for better or worse, and very importantly, it can show you that there is still hope for a future if we just reach for it.To the author, Lisa De Jong, thank you for giving us all such an inspiring story!

$review_text.: I used this textbook for an introductory logic course in college and absolutely loved it. I have kept it even after finishing the course and graduating from university.I found the explanations clear and the exercises helpful. They did a good job explaining difficult concepts in a clear and concise way.The software that comes with this book is also very helpful and compliments the exercises and book very well; I wish all of my textbooks had software packages that were that helpful. I know some other reviewers have criticized the software for being "too confusing" but I didn't find this to be the case at all (although I must admit I was a senior Computer Science major when I took this course, so that may have had something to do with that). The only thing that took a little time to learn was the keyboard shortcuts for Fitch (the program for doing proofs). Granted, for people who aren't good with a computer the software may have a bit more of a learning curve but once they learn it I think even they will admit that it's a great aid to learning.My only major complaint about this book is the fact that the software can only be used once, which is a game that the publisher plays to force students to buy a new textbook. (This is the main reason I rated the book four stars instead of five).One thing that I really would have liked to have seen a treatment of is informal fallacies. Yes, I do realize this book is mostly about formal logic, but still, I was a bit surprised that this was omitted from the book; if I were the authors, I would at least include an appendix on that or something.  If you're studying logic on your own, you may want to supplement the book at this point.Other than those issues, this is a wonderful textbook and a great introduction to the basics of modern logic. It is appropriate for all sorts of people; it's practically essential if you're in philosophy, math, or computer science, and the format of this book will be particularly helpful for people in these fields.

$REVIEW.: This book was a wonderful introduction to Booby Birds


 I never knew they existed!  My son and I thoroughly enjoyed this book that was filled with so many beautiful pictures and really fun facts
 We learned so much about these funny looking yet fascinating creatures


 We could imagine their amazing 80 foot dives to catch food

 We felt bad for the Nazca booby fledglings who got thrown out of the nest!  We loved their brightly colored feet and the adorable little chicks!Kids and parents will enjoy this wonderful book about these special birds.

$REVIEW.: I really enjoyed My Cheeky Angel by Mimi Barbour. The beginning grabs you and pulls you in. Your rooting for Annie and Tyler to see whats there through the book. Annie was a lovely character, a woman who was struggling with who she was as a person. She felt trapped the way she was living and wanted a change. But as the saying goes, "the grass isn't always greener on the other side of the fence". Through her changes she realizes whats important to her and what she actually needs in her life. Tyler is every girls dream guy. The sweet best friend, the one who always calls you up to go out. But unrealized is how much each cares for the other. The other characters in this book are amazing. Mrs. Barbour did a wonderful job of introducing secondary characters and telling their stories. I am in love with several. This is definetly a book to read and I'm now a follower of Mrs. Barbour!*I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for my review.

$REVIEW.: This review contains spoilers. Oh man, where to begin? I gotta say I wanted to love this, really. I read the reviews and thought wow this will probably straight up my alley, I was so wrong. This 'hero' and I use the term loosely, is a terrible excuse for a man. I just could not stand him at first. I kept reading though and I was actually surprised that I grew to like him the more I read the book. I loved the fact that Peyton shot him down at first but she changed her tune too quickly for me, he should have had to work more for it. And I have no idea why the author felt the need to throw in so much mystery surrounding Dominic and Chris, it just felt weird to me which might be the point. I stayed up late cause I had to know how it ended. I wish I hadn't. Not only is Tristan a coward but he is also a liar. If you don't mind that in a 'hero' then you might enjoy this. I felt cheated of the hours I spent reading this crap and I will not be reading the second because Mr. 'hero' can't keep it in his pants and has sex with the dumb girl from the bar, after moving in with her, after telling Peyton he 'had to do this by myself'. God the whole thing just left me feeling sick.

$review_text.: I could not believe that such an intense, full length novel would be such a bargain.  The writing is creative, smooth flowing and draws the reader in so well.Anderson is so good at creating characters that you love and/or love to hate.  Her creativity in producing such a believable world and characters keeps the reader turning page after page.  While you know the male & female protagonists will get their HEA, it's an emotional trip to the very end.  It keeps you guessing on how it can possible come out.

$review_text.: Book 2 of "Liberty Springs, Wyoming". Book 1No Bag Limit. Book 3 "Tag and Release"  has not been released on Amazon at the time of this review.Plot:Bailey appears on Jory's doorstep, hurt, traumatised, and divorced. And all grown up. Time to see if they can make themselves a HEA they can both live with.Comments:- Contemporary bdsm erotic romance set in SmallTown USA.- 3395 kindle locations, 59,410 words.- Sex is all m/f. Jory is an active Dom; he takes on subs for training and plays at clubs. Bailey has been trying to learn the bdsm ropes so she can take on Jory. When they come together the sex is Dominant, including bdsm acts (spanking, anal, wax, a "dungeon"), but we also get relatively vanilla sex. We also witness hardcore bdsm scenes in a club. We are heading towards longterm commitment for the two of them.- He's 45. Bailey is 15 years younger. As Bailey grew up, Jory took on the role of older brother. Now their relationship is taking on a very different aspect.- Book2 of a series. Book1 introduced characters, the idiosyncrasies of the small town, and a slight teaser into Book2. Characters from Book1 reappear in Book2 and play an integral role. We start "Hook, Line and Sinker" as Book 1 is coming to a close. They can be comfortably read out of order.- Book3 "Tag and Release" tells the story of Emma's sister Casey and the Marshall boys.Opinion:Damn it. Ms Cole actually put tears in my eyes before I was 10% in. Not what I expected. Love, pain, compassion. Good Lord, woman, give me a break!"Hook, Line and Sinker" is a highly emotional, highly erotic, bdsm romance. It's heavily relationship based so not a whole lot happens, and we don't get *everything* tied in a nice little bow at the end. Our heroes have lived, they've made mistakes, they've suffered traumas. But together they are More; they give to each other what they need and they Love.I should point out the bdsm is pretty intense. It probably hits as hardcore as I can comfortably go. There isn't humiliation, strange scenes, or pet references, but we do have fairly intense pain, some Domination, and plenty of bondage. We witness harder-core scenes in a Club. Everything is extremely consensual and loving. Bailey certainly wants everything she gets. But she gets A Lot. On the other hand, Bailey *never* loses herself to the submission. She is strong, independent, intelligent, and those aspects are admired and encouraged by Jory. In fact, he almost encourages her attempts at topping since it makes life *fun*. Bailey's submission is only ever expected in playtime, and only in private or at Clubs (not 24-7). A very engaging, intelligent exploration of bdsm.Once again Ms Cole hits the mark with "Hook, Line and Sinker". A book I highly recommend and well deserving of 5 stars.Similar book:The relationship in "Hook, Line and Sinker" is reminiscent of Sophie Oak'sOne to Keep- a 24x7 older Dom and his usually-vanilla younger sub explore how they can turn their lust and love for each other into a lifetime commitment. Cole however goes much further into the bdsm scene.-CR-

$REVIEW.: To be clear, those of you looking for something similar to Kitchen Confidential won't find what you're looking for here. This is a collection of Anthony Bourdain's articles and short works that he's published over the years. As usual, his wit and charm (rough as it can be at times) is still intact. As an added bonus, at the end is a section where Bourdain reacts and responds to these short works years down the road. If you're a fan of Bourdain, this is a no-brainer. You should give this collection a look.

$review_text.: It's apparent, now, that Michael Collins doesn't like American academia
In the previous book of his I read, the Resurrectionists, he had a petty thief redeem himself at a college in the upper Midwest because the denizens of this institution didn't recognize him for what he was

The current book is a  more acerbic skewering of the institution: E


Robert Pendleton, a flash-in-the-pan novelist who's retreated into the refuge of a college in Indiana where he teaches meaningless writing courses to disinterested students while self-publishing "experimental" works no one reads

His rival from his college days, a successful novelist who has morphed himself into a writer of "coffee table books" who takes the safe, easy, commercial path in writing, which of course Pendleton hates and at the same time envies


As a result of this guy coming to give a lecture at the college, Pendleton tries to kill himself, and this sets in motion a series of other events that have all sorts of repercussions.In the basement of his house, one of Pendleton's students, now taking charge of his affairs because he's only semi-functional, discovers a book he self-published some years before

The book recounts the murder of a small girl by a character not too different from Pendleton himself
The student decides that the book is worth another look from real, professional publishers, and enlists the help of the successful rival
The rival's feeling guilty about Pendleton's suicide attempt, so he makes his pitch to the publisher, and the book takes off


When it does, the police receive, anonymously, a package of clippings that make it clear that the writer of the book might have actually killed a girl in the fashion described in the book


Enter a detective, one with a great deal of baggage of his own, and the fun begins.This is one of the strangest books I've read in recent years


The author has a real thing for the American liberal arts education system, which he clearly despises
He makes everyone involved in it in the book a villain or despicable at some level
I didn't really think the book actually had a protagonist, and as much as it does, he's flawed enough that at times you wonder if he's the killer, instead


The author doesn't spare any of the characters, and the ending of the book is frankly merciless
Even so, the book is worthwhile for its skewering of pretentious writing, and the academic system in America.

I went from smiling, to whimpering, to laughing out loud, to grinning like an idiot and all the way back through. New characters were introduced, and she made me love them as much as I did the ones from book 1, and made me hate others. It was another wonderful ride, and I can't wait for book 3 so I can go through all of it again.

After having passed all the exams and having an understanding of what each requires and being a State university (college) student I can say this book si great. Challenging but great.THE Genki 1 IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO PASS JLPT TEST 4 or 3!!!Let me repeat that againTHE Genki 1 IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO PASS JLPT TEST 4 or 3!!!While it can be a help, it simply does not go over enough information to insure passing.THE GENKI BOOK 1 and THE GENKI BOOK 2 DO NOT INSURE PASSING LEVEL 3 or 4!!!let me repeat tht againTHE GENKI BOOK 1 and THE GENKI BOOK 2 DO NOT INSURE PASSING LEVEL 3 or 4!!!The other reviewers who write that it does would have needed other knowledge NOT included in these books or with the cds.  You simply need more information. about it. The best book for passing the JLPT levels 3 and 4 do not exist. you need a thorough understanding which school can provide or multiple resources for the home study fanatic.I normally do not review. but would hate to see people just buying this and then getting to the examinations and not knowing a thing that was going on. Be careful what you read.THe book is great but if one of your goals is passing JLPT 4 or 3 this is not sufficuent alone.Thank you and good luck to you!

$review_text.: An Inconvenient Seduction is Ava Young's first novel, and it shows.  The ideas are solid: Lucy Nightingale and Marcus Somerville are two compatible people from different stations in life who must overcome their own assumptions and pride in order to realize their true feelings for one another.  However, the execution was somewhat heavy-handed.  For instance, instead of reading a sentence stating that Mr. Somerville is a nice man, or having a character flat-out say that Lucy and Marcus share the same interests, I prefer to glean that information from the characters' actions and interplay.  I also found the subplots - a red herring romance, some financial endeavors - slightly tedious and uninteresting.  The shifting viewpoint, moving constantly from one character to another without - what felt like - proper organization, grated on me, as well.Overall, for $0.99, I got what I paid for, and though it was flawed, there are still signs that Young could turn into a fine romance writer.  In my opinion, though, wait for her next book.

$REVIEW.: "Be the change you want to see in the world."  -- GandhiNorway - the land of elkhounds, buhunds and extremely long days and nights based on the time of year.This story opens in 1961 and features Finn, 9 and his single mother Gerd.  They live in a rough neighborhood outside of Oslo.  1961 - the upside downside year; the year Kennedy gave his inaugural speech and the New Frontier had officially begun; when the Silver Beetles were evolving into the Beatles we know and love; their early recording of "My Bonnie" put them on the music radar of their then future manager and when Ford Falcons were the Better Idea that graced many a street.  1961, a year that postdates the somewhat sedate 1950s when Jim Crow flourished and was the year of the Freedom Riders to end Jim Crow laws in the southern United States.  1961, just a short hop away from the years of radical change that marked the decade as one of social reforms, unrest and, of course change.  (One date inaccuracy in this book: August 18, 1962 was a Saturday and not a Wednesday as was stated in the book.  In 1960 and 1965 August 18 fell on a Wednesday.)Finn is part of this.  He experiences reforms in his good reputation in his class; change when he learns he has a 6-year-old half sister named Linda and unrest when he learns more about his deceased father.  More unrest and change hit the homefront when Gerd takes in a boarder named Kristian.  He brings a television, much to Finn's delight. Gerd works in a shoe shop and placed the ad for the boarder.Finn's deceased father's wife is a drug addict who cannot care for her daughter, Linda.  She sees Gerd's ad in November of 1961.  She then places Linda on a bus with nothing but a light blue suitcase and a note on how to take care of Linda.  Linda appears to be autistic.  Her speech is hit or miss and she does not appear to have social skills.  She even relies on Finn to talk for her unless she has a note to serve this same pupose.In effect, Linda is a freedom rider.  She is not riding the bus to effect social change, but that is exactly what her arrival brings into her new home.  Linda, bound to routines and bizarre eating habits helps her new family by having them socialize/interact with each other more than had previously been the case.  She is that freedom rider in that she left a home that could not meet her needs into a new environment.  Her accepting attitude was that social change that brought a sense of accord among the other members of her family.Other kids mock Linda; she is placed in a special class in the local school.  Finn goes toe-to-toe with the principal about this.  Linda, meanwhile is perfectly content wherever she is.  At no time does she mention or ask about her mother.  She settles right into her new home with her half-brother and stepmother and Kristian.Linda, who speaks very little reveals much about her new family based on how they all interact.  She enjoys going on a summer trip with them the summer of 1962, Kristian included.  She shows her swimming prowess.  Linda deflects Finn's concerns when Gerd secretly goes to a hospital due to her instability.  Gerd, herself the product of child abuse identifies with Linda.  Her relationship with Finn is rather odd and her behavior is erratic.Linda probably does have mild autism.  Her behavior sounds as if that might have been the case.  Finn describes her as a "Martian" and says that "Linda was not of this world...she was a Martian come down to earth to speak in tongues to heathens, to speak French to Norwegians and Russian to Americans."I like the way Jacobsen includes places of interest in the book; the story is like a Norwegian handshake.  Readers can get a sense of this beautiful country and I loved the decriptions of places that the characters got to visit.Nods to the era are included in this book, such as Anita Lindstrom's Swedish translation of a 1961 song, "You Can Have Him." Anita Lindstrom enjoyed her moment in the sun during this period.  Jacobsen does an extraordinary job of creating characters who view the world through Linda and interpret the motives of others through Linda such as at a family Christmas party in 1961 and 1962.  Readers watch the change in family dynamics and the maturation of Finn.  He experiences the usual range of emotions regarding Linda, from jealousy to resentment to brotherly protector.  Linda herself seems remarkably accepting of all; she does not appear to take umbrage in anything anyone says or does.  She appears to be perfectly okay with wherever she happens to be.  All is well and moving along a fairly even keel until January 8, 1963.This book makes me think of Gandhi saying being the change you want to see in the world.  Finn is that change in this book; his quiet persistence wins out and helps him develop mettle he might not have known he had.

$review_text.: Three and a half stars, really.This is my first reading of an Alison Kent book


I liked a lot about it

The town, the characters, the author's attention to detail and way of telling the story drew me in and made me want to keep reading
But I just could not get my head around one of the major premises


Why would someone who has been looking for a particular person for years not rejoice when that person is finally found? Especially if that person seems to be mentally balanced and a contributing, normal member of society


I felt the author never gave a good reason why this main plot point was one of such angst instead of happiness

Yes, she attempted to address the subject, but not when it was needed in the plot, and it was never convincing.That aside, I enjoyed the overall story and was interesting in finding out what would happen next
I will probably read more of Alison Kent's books, and I hope the characters emotions do not end up feeling so plot-driven.This is definitely worth a try.(Mrs
JS)

$REVIEW.: Finally a non-idiot book for pot limit 0maha. Rolf claims to "have held nothing back" in his book, and I believe him. Slotboom details his "small-stack" strategy which mathematically served him to become one of his games most frequent winners. He also details a large-stack strategy. His book is pretty comprehensive, he covers starting hands, but he goes into more detail--detailing on how he would play them on early and also on the button. This book also includes "classic" Slotboom articles. Slotboom's writing style is fun. He's a deep thinker but you'll also see him in a deep strategy section refer to an opponent as "tight-a**"!

$review_text.: Nicki Sosebee is back with all the dramas that come with her!  Whilst covering a beauty pageant for the newspaper (she is now on the payroll), she encounters a very superficial woman who ends up running for the city council

 She has no personality, no knowledge about local issues and no idea what she will if she wins the seat but she is rich and pretty, so a sure fire win!  To sum it up in one word, she is fake


 Nicki realises that she is one person and one person alone can not make a difference but she is not afraid to challenge the status quo and she is certainly not giving the new woman on the block an easy ride of it!  Nicki now has a genuine interest in local politics, supported and encouraged by Sean


 The recognition of how politics impacts on her life and those in a similar position is a new experience for her but she speaks her frustrations eloquently!Nicki and Sean's relationship seems to be solid but when Sean goes into a funk, Nicki doesn't quite know how to deal with it and Sean won't talk about it


 Will we ever find out what sends Sean into these mood dips?  Unfortunately, this is not the only relationship bump that they will have to deal with as Nicki unintentionally hurts Sean whilst trying to find her own peace of mind


 I think that Nicki is crazy for believing what she did but she needed reassurance, showing her insecurity
 It backfired and badly
 Will their relationship be able to recover from this?  They are a couple that belong together in my eyes - Nicki is still immature in knowing how to be in a relationship, which explains her struggles in communicating effectively with Sean


 She ultimately loves him and the idea of commitment doesn't scare her as much as it did with Jesse


 Sean has his own issues to deal with and needs support from NIcki


 He loves her deeply but will he be able to overcome his feelings that Nicki has betrayed him?Another fantastic addition to the Nicki Sosebee series


 I am loving the relationship between Nicki and Sean and how they are finding their way together
 Whether the bumps and dips they navigate their way around in their relationship will have a lasting impact is yet to be seen


 I just have to say &#34; GO Nicki!!!&#34; in standing up for the average person!

$review_text.: Although most of the painters are from a limited age group (thirties) and geographic area (NYC), this book is both fun and inspiring for visual artists like me. I like the frankness with which the artists describe their work habits. Years ago, I saw an exhibition of Joe Figg's miniature studios. The work was reverent, humorous, and fascinating. His book is just as carefully put together. I wish there were new editions with visits to other artists' studios.Update: My wish is answered by the blogs called studio critical, structure and imagery, painters' table, and two coats of paint.

$review_text.: There is no sugar coating this, Worth It by Nicki DeStasi is not for the faint of heart
 This book starts off running and I kid you not you will run the entire way through it
 I'm still sweating and trying to catch my breath.I implore you to read the synopsis and take heed of the warnings


 This is a tough story to read
 There are things that happened that even I had a hard time grasping and I'd like to think I'm pretty tough


 The things that Anna goes through are more than any one human being should EVER have to endure

 I don't know how she functions day to day let alone hold down a job and go to college

 But bless her heart she does it
 Talk about a strong woman and she doesn't even know it.When Jed comes into her life I was seriously worried

 I didn't think she needed him


 I hoped she would stay far away

 I was too worried about where this interaction might go
 My poor Anna needs to heal BIG TIME


 She can't take anymore

 I can't take anymore.Jed

 That man.He's so sweet


 And patient
 And kind

 And protective
 He likes her
 He likes her likes her


 My mood shifted a bit with the way Anna responded to Jed

 I had a glimmer of hope for both of them
 Only Jed has a short temper so just when I would get comfortable, I would be thrown right back into my sea of despair
 Right along with Anna I might add.If you can handle the deep shit this book offers

 DEEP I tell ya


 Then you MUST add this to you TBR


 This is going to be big hit
 You need to hear Anna's story.The ending will rip your heart out and stomp all over it
 I still can't get it out of my head
 I never saw it coming
 As I was digesting the words my brain was screaming &#34;no effing way!&#34; &#34;no she didn't (the author)!!&#34;
 Then I had to fight those darn tears.It's been a while since I've read a story that riled me up


 I'd been missing that feeling so thank you Nicki
 I need it and even though I feel like I've been to hell and back it was totally WORTH IT!*A copy of this book was kindly provided by the author in exchange for an honest review*

$REVIEW.: This book I ordered for lending 2 of my friends after that they a day told me about how high blood pressures they just in a hospital had been measured to have, and then was told to do something to again get it back to the original pressure.But already 3 year ago I bought the equipment for measuring the blood pressure after my wife in the hospital also had been told that her pressure was too high


A normal reason to this often failure, which is missing in the book, is that patients while visiting the hospitals can be stressed or nervous and besides that the nurses don't let the patients relax 10 - 20 minutes after they have walked over from the other side of the hall for having their blood pressure measured

Personal I each time see that in the hospitals when visiting a doctor as I then normally are being measured to have around 120 for the high blood pressure, the Diastolic, opposite to when I measure it at home and normally only get it to around 100, which I tell the nurses

And by concentrating and relaxing at home I get the Diastolic down to close to 90
And besides the book also forget to mention about the difference in the pressure when measured on the left arm or on the right arm.Further more in the book I am missing some pictures

That is especially some pictures showing how to measure the blood pressure if sitting on a chair or laying on a bed

Because if we are sitting on a chair and measure on the upper part of the arm, as is normally done in the hospitals, the measuring is taken on the left upper arm in the height being equal to the heart
And if lying on a bed then by having the arm being beside the body, again for having the measuring point at the same height as the heart
But if we measure on the wrist (the left one) then we must have the wrist up in height with the heart for getting the most correct pressure.On side 5 we se written down the different classifications for blood pressure


And here among other we have the normal Systolic being 120 or less and Diastolic being 80 or less


But it ought to be written to how long they can go down

As I recall from T


Colin Campbells book: "The China Study", we there read how the American research persons were chocked when they 30 - 40 years ago came to China and then discovered that healthy people over there were living with the unbelievable low blood pressures all ways down to 80 and 60 (as I recall it)
Which in USA at that time were believed as being impossible?And on side 13 it's written "....that moderate amounts of alcohol have positive benefits, there really is no long-term proof"
To this I must highly protest as especially concerning Wine we over decades have been reading about "The French Paradox"

That is that even though people in many Southern countries in Europe are eating foods containing much fat they don't have the same health problems as people in Northern Europe and USA

And that this is caused by their drinking of Wine, and not by taking the alcohol as Whisky or Beer.But all together it's an all right book about blood pressure and what in our behavior including among other the eating that influence on it.

$SUMMARY.: Some helpful information concerning blood pressure.

I really liked the oppression that Byrn is put under. Despite what obstacle she faces, she still loves and sacrifice everything for William. For a moment, I was sad that everything has to be so difficult for them. UGH! Why can't love between two people be easy for once! Because some loves are just wroth fighting for.Of course  you can expect the love interest to be strained. Expect harsh words, wall-building, and roller coaster ride of emotions enough to break your heart 100 different ways. At least int the end, things are finally getting set straight.Fallen Eden, is what the title describes. Falling inn love, falling in the wrong places and wrong times.

$REVIEW.: I did not read book 2 in this series (Out of Focus), and it's very obvious that these characters have a prior history and much of the storyline of this book refers back to events from book 2
 I wouldn't recommend that you read this as a standalone story

 The other books in the Adams Grove series have been self-contained stories, so this caught me off guard.Kasey Phillips is a single mom raising her young son in the small town of Adam's Grove, Virginia


She's been a widow for several years now and she feels that she's already had her "one true love" and doesn't expect to ever experience that again.Country superstar Cody Tuggle is about to take a break in his hectic touring schedule


 His career may be thriving, but his personal life is lacking
 Cody longs to take his friendship with Kasey to the next (romantic) level

 Just as it looks as if Kasey and Cody may actually be getting somewhere in the relationship department, Cody becomes a prime suspect in a murder and Kasey finds herself wondering  how she could possibly fit into Cody's high profile world.While this wasn't by any means a bad book, it failed to evoke any emotional response in me whatsoever - not a good thing when it comes to a Romance!  As the story opens, Cody is already fairly certain that he's in love with Kasey
 Why does he love her?  I haven't a clue, because all that apparently happened in a previous book
 Kasey is grappling with anxiety about her son's safety because of a traumatic event that happened in a previous book
 The truth is that not a whole lot happened in THIS book to hold my interest.Cody's life as a C & W superstar did seem like pure fantasy; it's really hard to picture a group of very famous musicians contentedly camped out in tour buses in a cow pasture outside of Podunk, USA

 Sorry, but it just seemed very contrived
 And the name "Tuggle" seemed silly to me
 Tuggle


 Tug Boat

 I kept picturing a short, chubby, balding guy instead of the gorgeous stud that the author described.The mystery portion of the book was pretty well done

 I didn't guess who the "guilty person" was, and the whole thing played out in an interesting way

 I'm willing to chalk up some of my dissatisfaction with this book to the fact that I didn't read the series in order, but even putting that aside I have to say these characters just felt flat and two dimensional to me


 Recommended only to readers who have read the previous books in the series.No strong language or sexual  contentThe series, in order (according to the author's website):*Sweet Tea and Secrets (An Adams Grove Novel)*Out of Focus (An Adams Grove Novel)*Wedding Cake and Big Mistakes (An Adams Grove Novel)*Pecan Pie and Deadly Lies (An Adams Grove Novel)*Mint Juleps and Justice (An Adams Grove Novel)

$REVIEW.: A Dangerous Bargain is the first book in the Sentinel Demons Series by J.S. Scott.  This is the first book that I&#8217;ve read in this genre.  I was pleasantly surprised by the story of Kat and Zach.  It was a quick read that I read in one sitting.  I am giving it a four star review only because I haven&#8217;t read anything in this genre to compare it to.  If you enjoy books about Demons and Sentinels, I would recommend this is for you.  I look forward to reading the second book in the series.

$review_text.: This book does contain some useful information on self-publishing, but I was a bit disappointed as I was looking for information on actually publishing for the iPad. That was not what this book was about! This book is mainly about promoting FastPencil.com. If you use them to publish and use their paid distribution service your book will be included in the Apple store.That being said though, I am fascinated by their writing model. I will be signing up for a free account and trying out writing with their setup. They also promise to solve lot of the formatting problems that plague so many self-publishers. Will I pay for distribution thru them? Probably not. I can see them being a great all-in-one service for some authors. But my current main avenues of publishing (Kindle and CreateSpace) are free and I don't have to give them a cut of the royalties I already enjoy.

$REVIEW.: The Remnant is the story of the organized slaughter at Babi Yar in Ukraine and the fragment of people who clawed their way from that ghastly human abattoir devised by the Nazis.Though I am revolted by the excesses committed in the pitched blood fever of fighting, I at least understand it.  What I cannot understand is the coolheaded planning  of men (and not a few women) who carried it out.  The biggest shock is the role played by the Vatican. Not only did it endorse Hitler's annihilation of the Jews, it instructed individual priests sickened by the butchery to shut up and look the other way.  I was horrified to learn the Catholic Church's underground railway helped many Nazi war criminals escape justice.  The blood on the Vatican's hands will not easily wash off and even yet today successive Pope are trying to remove that ugly stain.The recorded history of these pockets of resistance that sprung up from the 'remnants' of Jewry puts the lie to the myth the Jews did not fight back.  They did, with everything they had.  But how well do women and elders and small children stand up to men in their prime, armed with machine guns and murder in their hearts?And for the record, I am neither Jew nor Catholic.

$REVIEW.: Let me start by saying that I am enjoying this book. The plot line is cute. There are very few spelling/syntax errors (which is a common problem with the Kindle free/cheap books). However, the main premise of the book is a detective agency that specializes in catching errant spouses, so the wronged spouse has evidence for a divorce. California has had a &#34;no fault&#34; divorce law for decades (the first in the country in 1969!) If the author hadn't written such a &#34;cute&#34; story, I wouldn't finish reading it. She needs to use another state for her setting, mention that she only works for a spouse with a cheating clause in the pre-nup or change the main job that the agency performs.If the book weren't so cute, I would have given it one star.

$REVIEW.: This bundle brings all the brothers together in this sexy as hell box set. The Buckhorn men as so damn sexy, sweet (yes even Morgan) you'll fall for them in a minute.As always Lori Foster has a great series, read this one a few times. Sawyer my favorite ( sexy as hell doctor) but Morgan although tough as nails ( or thinks he is) is lovable too. Love the closeness of family with all brothers and of course Sawyers son Casey! Who wouldn't love a house full of men (haha). Both Sawyer and Morgan love being single but know with their hometown reputations their not aloud to cut loose but when Honey breaks down Sawyers fence and Sawyers defenses he can't help but fall for this beautiful strong women. Then in comes Misty Honey's sister and when she comes to visit Morgan can't help but strong arm her into loving him. Sawyer is sweet, sexy as hell and romantic and smitten, Morgan is so hot for Misty, he can't get enough, I loved the part where Morgans Naked in the kitchen and Honey makes him dress...too funny.For both Honey  and Misty the men break down their defenses and builds them back up, even though all claim to love being bachelors they get a case of the love bug. Another great series to follow. Can't wait for Casey's storyGabe/Jordan although liked Sawyer and Morgan in buckhorn beginnings more, this sequel is good. Very sexy men, courageous women. Fun and loving family. Great read but wasn't as good as the first book. Even though Jordan and Gabe sexy as all their brothers it wasn't as sexy a story, they both felt almost pushed through to get their happily ever after. Gabe and Jordan are both well sought out bachelors but once they catch their  ideal women their as lost as their brothers. It just felt too quick and rushed I pared to Sawyer (my fav) and Morgan (so sexy)

$REVIEW.: Entertaining Classic Western
 This story has a little twist (which I'll withhold in order not to spoil the conclusion) on the often told story of the boy whose parents are murdered by outlaws and who falls under the care of a man who teaches him the skills he needs to exact his revenge


 Even though the basic story line is not new, that doesn't mean that this story is not worth reading
 The author tells his story well and it kept my interest

 There is plenty of action

 I believe four stars is a little generous, but I like Classic Westerns and I really like the author's contributions to the Genre.

$REVIEW.: There are two parts to this self-healing audio book. The first part is narrated by Dr. Andrew Weil, who does a very good job of explaining the concept of energy medicine and how it is not simply a new age concept, but also relates to other practices used in traditional, science-based medicine. He does not try to explain things that cannot be explained scientifically, but simply shares his experiences and perceptions. He's earnest and intelligent and conveys his portion well.The second part is an introduction by Dr. Ann Marie Chiasson who discusses her experiences as well as guides the listener through actual exercises to practice energy healing. Her explanation part is a bit long, and contains some new age terms (like "chakras") and felt a bit bogged down at times. I think she was simply trying to offer more context and history than Dr. Weil, but I found it the least appealing part of the CDs.The exercises themselves can be viewed in two ways. You can see them as physical exercises which cause a specific result and are not related to anything about internal energy or you can view them as a means to actually improving the flow of energy in your body much in the way Chinese, Indian, or "New Age" concepts believe. Whether you believe the underlying principles or not, it is worthwhile doing the exercises since they can have positive results. I did the exercises, and felt better and energized after doing them. In particular, the "toe tapping" exercise (which has nothing to do with tapping your toes as we might conceptualize it) actually caused me to feel vibrations in my chest and arms. This was surprising result. I also felt better, but, again, this may simply be from the exertion.I think these exercises are useful for the physical aspects whether or not you "believe" in the underlying concepts, and I found the content interesting on the whole. If you feel sluggish or fatigued and would like some exercises to energize yourself,  I'd say you may benefit from doing the exercises that you are guided through on the second CD. You can simply skip the first CD if you don't care about the notion of "energy medicine".

$REVIEW.: This book is one of the better ones in the Star crusades series


This series have been a bit of a bumpy ride as far as I am concerned although it has never been really bad and, as I wrote, this book is quite enjoyable.The book takes off directly where the previous one left off


Thus we continue to follow Spartan who is now stuck on Earth
Earth is not what it used to be to say the least and Spartan and his J&ouml;tnar friend have to struggle not only against the Biomechs but also against the stupidity of the Earthsec forces and commanders

I think this is the parts of the book that I liked the most
Obviously Spartan gets to demonstrate who is right and who is not more than once.A second story thread follows Colonel Morato as they stage a defence of an Alliance planet against a major Biomech invasion fleet

As it turns out, the entire thing is not exactly what it seems at first but rather carefully planned by the Alliance


This is also nice reading with plenty of action although I find the smoke screens and not telling all the facts to people like Morato a bit ludicrous

The J&ouml;tnar are quite involved and as usual this is fun reading with their usual thirst for a good fight and them more or less walking around with tank guns as handheld firearms.During the latter parts of the book Spartan makes some interesting discoveries on Mars while he is in the process of kicking some Biomech behinds


It will be interesting to read where this leads in the coming books.Although this book series never really manages to place itself on my all-time-high list, although I have a difficulty putting in words exactly why, it is quite enjoyable reading and I am definitely looking forward to the next one.

Much healthier!Paul Hewlett writes with a sure touch for children, never talking down to them or preaching, but as Lionel often manages to get himself into trouble by taking the easy way out and using his magical "Walbaun" foot to grant wishes, parents can use Lionel's misadventures as a jumping point for discussions. Best of all though, this is an entertaining story, with lovable characters that children are sure to take to their heart. Highly recommended for schools & libraries, a delightful read for children and parents alike.

Couldn't have done that part better myself if I even tried.With that said, there are tons of other things that Kerry brilliantly wrote in this book

The well developed, (and very well liked)characters have a history and a love that (eventually) crosses an ocean and countries

The sexiness and sweetness that becomes Liv & Danny's relationship ends up being a beautiful story all the way up to a nail biting ending.Speaking of said ending....I need Still Human as much as I need my next breath
You will too, once you finish this fabulous read

$review_text.: This book had me from page one. The lead character, Cat, is one sassy female. We enter this story where Cat finds herself in a position to save many lives including her own. Once that is done, her and her mates create a coalition with the armed forces to do battle against all evil, especially the non-human kind. I found the lead to be engaging and unique, strong yet vulnerable. I enjoyed learning about her, her family and friends as the story unfolded. This book has plenty of action and adventure and keeps an engaging pace throughout. I am anxious to read more of this serious and see what other adventures await. Nicely done, Ms. Moon.Lori

$REVIEW.: What can I say about Phillip Done's recounting of his elementary school teaching years except that it was a fun, fulfilling read?Mr
Done's writing is what I assume his teaching style to be like - - lighthearted, humorous and entertaining


 I was drawn into his book from the first page, partly out of curiosity for the teaching profession and partly due to his "getting to know you" style
 I can imagine that reading Mr

Done's book is akin to sitting down with him over dinner and letting him talk about all his third grade adventures.He begins with right before school begins, with the summer ending, and each section is a different month of the school year


 Everything from Back to School Night, where the seasoned teachers know to hide from the excitable students and their talkative parents, to never letting your profession slip while buying school supplies to the dreaded Picture Day.I found myself chuckling with reminders of my own school days - - the plastic combs given out on Picture Day, the show and tell (or what is now called "Sharing"), learning cursive writing, adventurous spelling and those crushes on classmates.If you get nothing else out of this book, the memories are worth reading it alone


 I dare you to read this book and not remember your own third grade teacher, or the best friend you had, a favorite outfit from that school year or the little boy (or girl) you had a crazy crush on.Well done, Mr
Done.

$review_text.: I.J. Schechter really does present exactly 102 ways for the freelance writer to earn income from writing, and the book announces loudly each one with large, bold, white-on-black numbers. The cleverness continues. The "102" puts the number of goodies one higher than the more humdrum 101 (...Ways to ..., Cook Artichokes, Do Your Laundry, etc.). The "1,500 Words" tells the serious writer that Schechter's ideas are each large enough to weed out the duffers, but short enough so that a good writer could secure many, many gigs for pay.Choice of title aside, "102 Ways" ranks at the top of writers' how-to books. The author's straight-shooter style sometimes gets called "non-nonsense," but one will find enough humor sprinkled throughout the text to make the book flow smoothly.  In fact, most of the book's charm lies in the matter-of-fact way which the reader sees that writing for income is quite a do-able thing. Chapter 4, "Corporate Writing," is easily worth the price of the book just by itself.The author plainly states what "102 Ways" does, and does not do. The book does detail what each of the writing area topics entails as to whom to contact, what to offer as service, how much effort usually goes into it, etc. The book does NOT name what specific gig charge rates should be. Schechter tells us to find this crucial current information in several places, e.g., Writers Market - excellent, excellent approach. Most books are vulnerable to criticism, or at least a few cautionary words. This one does not. "102 Ways" gives you plenty of money's-worth. Buy the book.

$REVIEW.: Description: Black Horse


The name haunted my dreams&#8230; But regardless of family vendettas, old hurts and contemptuous blood shed, the heart wants what it wants&#8230; The kingdom of my heart has only known one king, and his name is Colton McClain.His family is known by his father&#8217;s nickname: Black Horse

Like one of the four horses flying out of the gates of hell, Tom &#8220;Black Horse&#8221; McClain ripped my world apart twenty years ago


I was only five when I found my mother and father dead in their beds, with Tom McClain standing over them with a blood stained butcher knife

He would have come for me, too, had my brother not saved me
I was the only one of my family to walk out of that house alive that night.My brothers once considered Colton their best friend


Not anymore


Randy and Tim largely blame Colt for his father&#8217;s actions and take it to heart that I love the son of our parent&#8217;s killer
Colton is not to blame for their deaths, though&#8230; He was a victim, too
Now twenty years after murders, Black Horse is getting out of jail


He&#8217;s coming
He has a vendetta against me, because it was my testimony that put me away

Colt wants to hide me until he can take down his old man, but to hell with that


I have no intentions upon running
We cannot hide from this anymore.Our past does not own us, and we owe it to our hearts to show the world that love can arise from the darkest of places


We just have to survive Black Horse to tell the tale.If you love a book that takes you on a journey, then this is the book for you


This book has action, drama, love, passion, fierce devotion, and some hot sexy characters (male and female)


Throughout this book there are highs and lows, drama, angst, etc

These are all things I look for in a book and Addison delivered

This was the first book I read from Addison and I am certainly ready for more

Do yourself a favor and read thos book today!!

$REVIEW.: A pistol is only one tool for a person's self defense in public or at home

The basics of self defense start with the mindset that is often described as "situational awareness." If you go to a shopping mall do you watch the people around you? When walking out of a parking deck do you preserve a safe distance from the parked cars so that a would-be mugger can't so easily hide between cars?This book gets into stay-safe attitudes
There are lessons to be learned from ordinary people in great danger
Just owning a pistol is not enough
Standing in front of some bulls eye targets at a range and punching holes in paper is only a start


What counts is a sense of preparedness

Street-smart precautions, aside from being armed, include: taking a powerful flashlight with you to a movie theater; locking the door to the restroom if alone at night at a rest stop on an interstate trip; and taking care where you park in a parking lot or where you sit in a restaurant.The crime statistics in this country show that it is less dangerous than the past three or four decades
During that time practically all states have restored their citizens' 2nd Amendment rights by instituting "shall issue" rules for "carry permits."  The number of firearms in the hands of law-abiding civilians has skyrocketed in the past forty years, but violent crime has decreased
I guess that is why voters are not in favor of the gun control legislation  pushed by many members of the political class.

$review_text.: Honestly, I can't imagine this book working at all for readers who haven't read the earlier books in this series (at a bare minimum, The Chocolate Thief, The Chocolate Touch, and Snow-Kissed) - but as someone who has read those books, I found it so sweet and so much fun to read. I love the romance between cool, controlled Anne Winters (who is a lot like Martha Stewart) and tough Mack Corey - two powerful people who RESPECT each other's power so much and see underneath it to the vulnerabilities below. And seeing their children's reactions (because this is a couple in their 50s, with children who had romances earlier in the series) was just so much fun. It was great to see all the characters from the earlier books and novellas happy here together, as their parents finally find romance as well.

$REVIEW.: If it doesn't make me cry, grin and sigh, it is not a proper Amy Lane story. Yep, I'm convinced of it. And this one? Well, let's just say that my eldest thought I was having an 'episode'. According to her, I was laughing out loud one moment, sighing the next, wiping my eyes, swearing, crying and then grinning like the cat that caught the canary. Do you need me to say that I LOVED this book?! I think you get it, but if you're, for any reason, on the fence about it (*gasp* really?!) let me be clear.Perfect cover ~ Bah! If you know me, you know I'm a cover slut. So yeah, I judge my books by their covers and this one was perfect.Awesome main characters ~ I loved how adorably clueless rusty was. His heart was huge and his pain unbearable, but he made me smile and his strength of character, even when things went downhill, was wonderful. Oliver? Oliver was just too much. Loyal to a fault, understanding, determined but never too pushy (and when he was, it made for some fantastic couple of pages!). He was the ideal man for Rusty, even of Rusty took a while to 'see' it.Interesting secondary characters ~ There were a LOT of characters introduced in this story and each of them added something to the story whenever they came into the scene. I loved Oliver's dad and Rusty's sister. But my favorite was Rex, Rusty's roommate in college. He was truly a character.Emotions, emotions, everywhere emotions ~ Really, I have to explain? It's Amy Lane!!! Even with her fun stories she manages to wiggle the emotions in there to get at you. But even though she brought a whole range in emotions, I didn't find the story angsty.Surprise, surprise ~ Okay, so I was under the impression that this here was a Young Adult story (serves me right for looking at other people's shelves!), so I wasn't expecting anything more than some kissing and roaming of the hands. Er, nope. Well yes, there was that. Just that first kiss was...nevermind. You have to experience it for yourself and what it all entails. I'll just say this - NEW ADULT! (to those who have it shelved wrong!)So there you have it - a wonderful holiday read with two of the most engaging characters I've read in a while and a story that was as heart-warming as it was entertaining. Ahhh, gotta love M/M Romance (and Amy Lane, &lt;3 her too!).

$review_text.: After losing his partner, David, in a drowning accident two years ago Aaron has finally decided to attempt to move on - only when it comes right down to it that's much easier said than done.  He's faced with many regrets and lots of `woulda, shoulda, coulda' and could really use a new lease on life.  He knows he's not ready to embark on a new relationship and he certainly would have never thought that he'd be attracted to not one, but two men.Lovers Garrett and Dane are lifepartners who've entertained the idea of bringing a third into their relationship.  Garrett's career in law enforcement and Dane's shifts as an ER doctor means they're often working different shifts but they're happy with their lives and make the most of the time they do share.  There's no doubt that they share a strong committed relationship but they feel that adding another lover to the mix is exactly what they need.It's the Labor Day weekend and Garrett's on duty albeit a little envious of all the travelers heading to the beach.  The traffic is heavy and he's content to watch the vehicles around him as he considers the encounter he shared with Dane earlier that morning - and the residual effects he still feels.  The last thing he expects is to see a cherry red Mustang Cobra speeding through traffic recklessly or the resulting hit and run accident with a motorcyclist.  Even more stunning is the emotional reaction he feels toward the victim.  Sure it's his job to serve and protect but something about Aaron triggers a protective instinct, as well as a desire he normally only feels for Dane.Aaron's injuries are severe enough that there's no way he'll be able to cope on his own so after a few days hospital stay and a lot of teasing and tempting from Garrett and Dane he agrees to stay with him while he recovers.  There's no denying he's attracted to this couple but he doesn't want to ruin the close relationship they share either, besides, he's still reeling from his own loss.  Fortunately Garrett and Dane aren't above tempting and teasing Aaron until denying his own needs becomes unbearable.  Garrett and Dane insist that they want a permanent relationship with Aaron but will he be able to let go of his past and open his heart to a bright new future?As you can imagine, STARTING OVER by Annmarie McKenna is an emotionally charged read that really yanks at the heartstrings.  I could fully empathize with Aaron's difficulties in letting go of David and moving on with life and got a huge kick out of Garrett and Dane's not so subtle seduction techniques.  The element of BDSM in this storyline is subtle yet definitely appealing - especially since it's obvious that it's something the men all enjoy.  This story was well written and reduced me to tears at one point but still left me with a smile on my face and hope in my heart at the end.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)

$REVIEW.: When Angela Panther's mother Fran passes away from lung cancer, Angela knew she would be dealing with the grief from her mother's death, but she never thought that she would see her mother return as a ghost! It seems that before Fran could rest in peace in heaven, she has some unfinished business to attend to on earth. Thinking that she is dreaming at best and hallucinating at worse, Fran's celestial reappearance awakens a psychic gift of sight in Angela where she can see dead people, making her a reluctant medium who becomes a ghost whisperer helping the dead with their own unfinished business.In her debut novel, author Carolyn Ridder Asperson weaves a wickedly humorous and touching paranormal chick lit tale about the unending love that survives death between the living and their departed loved ones. Written in the first person narrative and set in Atlanta, Angela Panther takes the reader on a wild and emotional roller coaster ride as she tells them about her ghost whisperer adventures and life lesson experiences that is spurred on by the reappearance of her mother. I absolutely loved Fran, she was my favorite character, this Italian mama kept me in stitches with all her crazy antics. I also loved the best friend relationship between Angela and Mel, everyone needs to have a BFF like Mel, her one-liners were hysterical. I would be remiss if I didn't touch upon the poignancy of the loss of a loved one and the need for closure of unfinished business, it took me back to the bittersweet loss of my own mom in 2007. I believe that the author wrote from her heart, she has a way of keeping the story light and entertaining, while also providing a therapeutic touch that simply warms the heart and makes the reader smile.The author easily draws the reader into this entertaining story with a mixture of sassy humor, joy, sorrow, and true-to-life experiences that pulls at the heartstrings and keeps them turning the pages. With a witty cast of characters who are larger than life; a balanced mixture of laugh-out-loud moments, serious dialogue and fun interactions; and a touching storyline that anyone who has ever lost a loved one can relate to; Unfinished Business is a thoroughly enjoyable tale that leaves the reader wanting more.Unfinished Business is the first book in the Angela Panther Novel Series. Unbreakable Bonds, the second book in the series is scheduled to be released in November 2013.Disclaimer: I received a copy of the book from the author in exchange for my honest review.

$review_text.: My bees are coming in less than 2 months, and this book is the first and only one I have bought


 I am glad that I did!He starts with a brief explanation of the history of bees and beekeeping as well as bee biology and basic behavior (which is important to understand in order to know what the heck they are doing at any given time).Then he clearly explains what types of bees you can order and in what "packaging" and the equipment that you need as a beginner and what its use is.He provides good pictures and diagrams that detail out what he is talking about, so you know what a queen looks like, what the entire stack of equipment looks like and where each goes in the hive.Then he gives a detailed analysis of the current state of diseases, mites,  and other bee enemies and how to treat them, not taking sides on the ecological/chemical approaches.There are also two sections that cover step-by-step what you do when you get your bees (how do you get them into your hive without having a mutiny) and what you need to do for your bees throughout the different seasons of the year, culminating in how to harvest honey and how to extract it.The end of the book has some beeswax and honey recipes for food and products that you can make, and was useful but not necessary.The only complaint I have about the book is that he doesn't cover the foundation that you put in the frames in enough detail
 Foundation is an important and yet very confusing part of the hive for a new-bee like me.This book is exactly what you need as a beginning beekeeper.

A gift for my firstborn's  Vegan .family - especially for his wife


When it arrived I was a bit disappointed

The recipes are probably going to very much be to her liking as well as the eco-friendly paper type (not high gloss but has a recycled paper look)


But there aren't any beautiful full-color pics
In fact as first scan I didn't see any pictures

I didn't want to crease the seam or dirty the pages so I put it aside in the 'to-be-wrapped' box


 Good recipe book but not up to my book standards.

$review_text.: This book was a lesson in B & E.  If you had a time machine and could go back to the 50's, 60's and 70's that is.  Technology caught up to the K & A gang though, then drugs finished them off.  This book was just okay.  I enjoyed the parts about the actual break-ins and how they were done.  The rest was just so-so and at times drug.  The details about the bit players and their lives and jail times didn't do much for me though.

$review_text.: Why does there always have to be evil, deadly creatures from the depths of hell threatening to destroy all human life in most fantasy books?You would think that Brianna becoming a fire sprite and creating dragons would be more than enough to continue the story.  You would think that Zollin waking up the magical creatures of the world would be enough fodder for at least three more books.  Why do we have to descend into hell to keep the story moving?  Gwendolyn and Offendorl were evil enough in their present state of being.  Why do they need to be made even more evil??The serving wench who stole Bartoom's crown is an interesting twist, should be interesting to see where that's going.And, geeze, when are Zollin and Brianna going to consummate this relationship??  C'mon........how can this possibly harm the story??

$review_text.: Rating 3.5 starsThis was another surprise for me.  I read this in a compilation, a new author and series to me.  I probably honestly would not have picked it based on the description.  Rickert is from one side of the world (apparently divided in two) and Neyla from the other side.  The sides are connected with portals.  Neyla, due to a &#34;talent&#34; (magic, special ability, whatever), is forced to be part of the army force on her side.  Rickert is military on his side.  He captures Neyla and brings her back to his side, at first to get information, but quickly falls for her.  During the course of the story we get a better picture of what is happening between the two sides, at war, and it is not as it first appears.The writing in this was good, but it suffers as a lot of first books in a series do, because the author has to take the reader from zero knowledge to a basic knowledge of the world, and the storyline between the main characters suffers for it, especially apparent in a book this short in the first place.  So, I as a reader felt that the relationship between the couple was very much lacking, too fast, not reasonable.  And also was confused some on the &#34;world&#34; that is being built in this paranormal.  There just was not enough text/story there to accomplish a believable relationship and build the foundation of the story, though I do think the writer tried.  Thus, 3.5 stars, and I would read more of this series/author.  I think it will improve as it goes along and the world is more clear.

$REVIEW.: This book was about Carolina Meeting Logan in a coffee shop .. She thought he was a jerk right off. He was appalled that she didn't recognize him. Carolina was as well instantly attracted to Logan. Their story was frustrating and beautiful .. And kinda annoying .. for me I could understand why Carolina didn't want to get into a relationship with Logan because he refused to leave Gina. Gina was his girlfriend /manager that he had no clue how to bring up leaving her.Then Carolina met Turner and they were compatible. But she knew she wasn't madly in love with.. This whole book offered romance, confusion, emotions that were up and down. Poor Carolina I felt for her . How do you love someone that won't give up someone he doesn't care for anymore because its part of his career. How do you move on from it .

Unknown to Gabriel, Lucien is an evil Fallen Angel who wants his soul. And he wants Lily. Lily is a historian who works at the Salem Witch Museaum and her family and Gabrie's have hated each other for centuries because it was her family who pointed the finger of blame at Gabriel and his sister as witches. When they meet, it's destiny. They fall in love despite all odds. The story is an awesome romance, full of facts I didn't know about Salem. Ms. Black obviously did her research!

$review_text.: What a great introduction to the Avar-Tek series! I really liked the fact that the alien probe was engaged in its own moral and sentient growth as it decided how to proceed with the newly-discovered planet

And I truly felt for John and Dipesh's loss at the end (but loved the hopefulness of the captured beetle.)I would have liked a little more "alienness" to the probe (it felt fairly Earth-like to me.) And I would have also liked to get to know more about Dipesh - he is only revealed as a scientist who believes in God

But this is a short story, so I understand there wasn't time to get into more personal thoughts.The final resolution with the probe was really unique, and I could see it being an integral part of a larger story


I hope we see Hachiman again


I also hope the full-length novel delves more into character as well as the moral issues and the science touched upon in A Taste of Earth.Overall, very well done
I will look for more books by Justin Tyme.

$review_text.: The first part of the book really got me thinking about how we judge the quality and flavor of food
 In other words, what we grew up with usually is that which all over food products are judged by


 And pizza is definitely one of those foods that can spur on an obsession of finding THE BEST pizza.As much as I consider myself as a decent cook and a better baker, I've always failed to make fairly good crust
 Most of the time, it would take FOREVER for that crust to cook


 And the quality of the crust is about 70% of that pizza


 But these crust recipes..
 This is the first time I made a great pizza crust and it baked successfully in less than six minutes

 Okay, it did set off the smoke detector -- should be called a heat detector! -- but it was worth it.The onion marmalade was amazing!  I also use a garlic-mushroom-infused virgin olive oil when it's called for


 Totally awesome pizza!!I highly recommend this book.

$review_text.: This LoA volume gives us 3 Bellow novels: the short Seize the Day, and the normal size novels Henderson the Rain King, and Herzog.The short one could be called: A day in the life of a loserThe loser is Wilky Adler, a fair-haired hippopotamus in his own words, now in his mid 40s and a total failure. On the day of the action, he lives in a  hotel in Manhattan. He has moved out from his wife and two kids, because of a younger woman, and he has also lost his job as a sales executive. He has a failed acting career behind him. He hardly knows how to pay for family support. His girl friend insists that he gets a divorce before continuing their relationship. He has given his last few hundred dollars to a con man for market speculation. His well-to-do father refuses to help him out with money.As the song says: if it wasn't for bad luck, he wouldn't have no luck at all.A mess of a man. He is to blame for everything bad that happened to him, because of his inability to be responsible.Is this a master piece? I am still undecided.Then comes the grotesque Bildungsroman about the big obnoxious rich man, who takes a time out and travels to Africa: Henderson. Another hippo of a man, but this time non-Jewish. A pig farmer to spite a Jewish pal from war, as he tells it.  Very luxurious language for a pig farmer. He travels to Africa like Alice to Wonderland. I have no idea what the novel means, if anything, but it is quite amusing. In parts even beautiful. One could read it as an update of Innocents Abroad, if the visited places were real ones. Henderson is a different kind of loser. His projects go sour from his mindless way to attempt solutions head on.The third of the heroes in this collection, Herzog, is a real loser, but not a hippo. He loses his second wife to her change of heart. Or should one say to the realization that he is hard to live with? He loses his knack for his work as an academic and finds his mind go astray with no focus. He writes notes on this and that, and he writes letters, mostly just in his mind and generally without sending out.Of all Bellow novels that I have read so far, this is the one that I like best. In many pages it has qualities of the best Facebook rants. The narrative trick of the letters that Herzog writes to everybody under the sun works very well for me. Not all of the narration is letters though, there is much contemplative flashback too. The more one learns about him, the less surprising becomes his floundering.As Beck (the musician, not the court jester) said: I'm a loser, baby, why don't you kill me.

$review_text.: Akira Kurosawa's DreamsAn American friend recommended this book, going to Amazon all I saw were monster reviews. So I e'd a friend in Tokyo and she came back with "Think Joseph Campbell". Him I like, so I got the book. Glad I did. As the Japanese so value getting along with other Japanese, no surprise so many myths, not monsters, here are social/moral lessons. Think Hansel & Gretel getting cookies from a nice stranger.Yokai Attack! is a wonderfully-designed presentation with Manga-like illustrations, blessed with amazingly good writing, a collaboration of Japanese-Western writers, full of surprises, humor, Japanese cultural info, history and mores.  But the title?  Abit Misleading.Example: Neko-Mata, a shape-shifter derived from abused cats. Mistreat a cat and it'll come back and eat humans. YA! says it's a metaphor for consequences of mistreating those smaller, weaker than you.Or Warashi, a cute little-girl yokai who likes playing pranks and being in a happy home. But if the home becomes unhappy, she leaves, taking good fortune with her.Moral: Keep a happy home.Ah, and the Kitsume, Japanese red foxes. They're pranksters, unless crossed. Then lethal. In fact, Akira Kurosawa's DREAMS includes a story of a boy who's told not to spy on a Kitsume wedding. He does and is sentenced to death. "The foxes, they don't usually forgive." Boy dies. Moral: Follow the Rules.And on and on like that for 50 yokai's. All, fascinating, fun ways to see a culture. Wait until you read about the Bathtub Licker, Akaname. His moral: When Done Clean The Tub.

$REVIEW.: After reading the &#34;Shattered Hearts&#34; series, I was looking forward to &#34;Abandon&#34;, having really liked Tristan in the other books. So getting to read his story was exciting.It was a quick and entertaining read that I did enjoy although at times I was missing more depth and character development as well as emotional intensity.But then again, it fit Tristan who tried to live his life as shallow as possible. A hot musician he didn't miss a chance of getting into girls' panties, treating them as nothing more than a pass-time activity, never allowing himself to feel or to let someone in. That started to change with Senia coming into his life and turning it upside down. But the demons from his past made it hard for him to love and it might take him losing what he loves to realize what is truly important to him.Senia on the other hand has had a bad taste in men and it could be argued that Tristan isn't that much different. But she sees more in him. And as her life is also turned on its head, she realises she has to give him a chance to prove himself. But will it be enough when his dark past is brought to light? Or will she have to admit he is not the person she believed him to be?I liked the story and the characters, despite sometimes feeling like they were one-dimensional. It felt like something is missing in the story. Though the situations they faced were heart-breaking and tragic, their reactions, feelings and emotions were lacking depth. It made it hard for me to get emotionally invested into the story. At times it felt a bit rushed which made it difficult to feel the emotional agony that was potentially in the story.But the plot was original and I enjoyed the twists and turns, the ups and downs the story had to offer.Despite some short-comings the story was definitely captivating enough to make me finish the book in one sitting.3.75 tragic, sweet and tender stars.

$review_text.: I only started reading this series of 9 books five weeks ago. I have read them all in order and have thoroughly enjoyed all of them. Each of the main characters are great and often humorous . I haven't read the series for the added romance but because I really enjoy the characters. Each book starts where the last one finishes and has a different paranormal case or two to solve which keeps it fresh . Book 9 does not disappoint - now I'm awaiting book 10!

There are many plot twists and challenges faced by the protagonist. Still he doggedly pushes toward the truth. I enjoyed this and will read other books by Ed James.

$REVIEW.: So I really really liked this book! Although its kind of messed up being about a student and a teacher who fall in love, but of course this is not the first or last time that it will ever happen. Addison is already messed up to begin with, and you will find that out when you read the book. Mr Mckendick is a teacher who tries his best not to fall for her, which doesn't work! I love the way it was written, and how the story unfolds, tellling you bits and pieces. It leaves you wanting to know more and keeps you reading just to find out a little bit more. The ending was not what was expected but I loved it !

$review_text.: House of Dark Shadows drew me in and boy am I glad it did. Every book in the series (there are six) gets better and better--even when you don't think the story or the write could possible get better. For a few chapters after the prologue, the story is as slow as it ever gets through the whole series (if slow is the right word--it's still interesting and necessary, I think, to set up the characters, the location, what's happening)...and then POW! the fun starts. I don't think it lets up until the last page of the last book (Frenzy). The cool part is: everyone from kids (10?) to adults can enjoy this series (I know at least 20 people who love it and their of all ages). It has lots of action, suspense, mystery, history, humor (not not cheesy, toilet humor). I can't recommend it highly enough.

$review_text.: Short, pithy stories by one of the most unique Sci Fi writers of all time. PKD excels at stories about meeting extraterrestrials and what that shows about the psychology of being human. For me, one third of the stories are obsessed with war - remnants of the old communist threat from beyond the Iron Curtain. But, &#34;Second Variety&#34; rivals Blade Runner as a premonition of the technology (for war) in the near future. &#34;The Defenders&#34; is a possible scenario with an unexpected twist at the end.A few of the tales have a truly unique angle on familiar themes. Time travel: &#34;The Variable Man&#34; and &#34;The Skull&#34;, Global mind control: &#34;The Hanging Stranger&#34; and &#34;Piper in the Woods&#34;. Two of these stories are repeated in other books in the Sci Fi Megapack Series: &#34;The Crystal Crypt&#34; and &#34;The Gun&#34;. A few of the stories are just exercises in the ridiculous: &#34;The Eyes Have It&#34;.Overall, a mixed bag showing all sides of PKD's writing style, with a few gems and a few duds.

$REVIEW.: I like a good story with a lot of passion. And there is definately a lot of passion here. Too bad the story was so poorly written that I had to rework most sentences in my head before I could move on. (In the future, if you're going to write again dear author, have someone proofread your manuscript! You couldn't write a sentence to save your life!) The author should have made Liam seek out Ella to deliberately ruin her relationship with Lucas. This would have made more sense than the whole everyone else knew who he was and she didn't have a clue; as well as Liam hates Lucas and wants to ruin him. Also, there could have been more development of the relationship between Ella and Liam. Why did they fit so well together when neither of them could commit before? And Lucas was such a spineless wimp I couldn't imagine anyone wanting a relationship with him. I'm hoping the continuation will fill in a lot of the blanks, and that it is better written.

$review_text.: This story is one of the sweetest Shonen-ai stories that I have read. The story is about a high school boy who finds that a popular and gorgeous senior has the same ring as he does and the misunderstandings that follow.  If you are looking for some lusty action, as the story is labelled Yaoi, then you may be disappointed. However, if you are looking for an innocent and sweet romance between two lovely guys then you will be in for a treat. The English translation may be slightly rough in some places, but the drawing style is perfect with the guys looking adorable but still like guys. The author also concentrates more on facial expressions than back- grounds, which is a good thing as their expressions can make your heart melt. Also, the book is instantly addictive and re-readable. It is also larger in size in height than normal mangas. The book is a stand-alone story but sequels in novel forms have been released. Still the ultimate shonen-ai story and a definite must-buy for fans.  4.75 stars.

$REVIEW.: Jones is writing about England, but his thesis would apply to America as well. He argues that the working class has been abandoned by mainstream political parties - the Conservatives under Thatcher and Cameron, but also by "New Labour" under Blair. He compares the latter to neo-Liberals like Clinton and Obama in the US.Several problems. First, he doesn't distinguish between those in the working class who actually work and those who subsist on state handouts. In fact, he continually switches back and forth between the two. He would insist that this is because the media and politicians see them as one stratum - that they have "demonized" the working class by portraying them all as feckless bums.Second, he doesn't make a good case for cause and effect. Is the dysfunctional behaviour of the underclass (as distinct from the working class) the result of their poverty or the cause of it? He condemns the latter view out-of-hand. He cites Charles Murray (Coming Apart: The State of White America) but dismisses him as a pseudo-sociologist and an apologist for the ruling class. According to Jones, the underclass are victims, pure and simple.Third, he doesn't accept that there were macro-economic forces at work during the last 30 years - free trade, technological change, globalization, etc. For example, he describes the closing of coal mines in England and the impact this had on working class communities as if it was entirely the result of Thatcher's union-busting policies. No consideration is given to the possibility that the mines were played out and that coal was being replaced by gas and nuclear power. Same with manufacturing plants that closed - it didn't happen because of China, but because British politicians refused to protect them with tariff barriers.During recent trips to Turkey and Spain, we ran into hordes of English package tourists. Most were typical working class people. Not welfare moms and soccer hooligans - but people with jobs and enough disposable income to go on a foreign holiday. They might be chavs, mocked in the press and scorned by the toffs in Knightsbridge and Windsor - but they certainly haven't been abandoned by the post-industrial economy. An interesting subject, but Jones' account is completely lacking in balance.

$REVIEW.: There are many reasons to look backwards. For one, it may help to figure out where one is by looking at where one has been. For another, one might rethink where one is going by looking at the ideals and goals of the past. One might assess societies as a whole in some grand way, such as its military budget or the outcome of elections, but for us common folk, there is no way to tell what is on our minds better than a look at what we are buying. This book is an absolutely fascinating compendium of the culture of the 50's - of our desires, our habits, our values, as told in its advertisements. On one level it is an amusing recollection of what we once thought was cool. On another it is a profound study of the sociology of America in a time of idealism and innocence. I saw many, if not most of these ads myself when they were originally published.That being said, I must add that the recollection of the feelings I had at that time is not entirely comfortable. On this other level, that of gut feelings, the book can be is a compendium of an appeal to the senses, to a culture of need, of having. One must look pretty deep to find any spiritual values here, and I think that the conspicuous absense of any moral sense is what is most interesting about it. Perhaps the most important lesson to be learned by those of us who look back is that the promises of those who offer us happiness by just one more purchase are really empty. Read this and be nostalgic, amused, reflective, and, just maybe, a little sad.

I've added a new favorite series to my must read shelf and a new book boyfriend to the special "hands off, he's mine" glass case. Cage is an easy recommendation for me to make if you're looking for a gripping novel to fall into without want of coming out.

$review_text.: I wasn't sure how I felt when I began this book.  But I can say that after a few chapters I was completely drawn into the story. The characters were real and by that I mean, they weren't perfect.  Each had their flaws and good points, like people do in every day life. Maybe that's why I related to it so well.  The feelings within me about each character is a big part of what makes a book work for me. If I can feel mad, angry, dislike, then I know the author has done their job in creating a well rounded character.The subject is touchy, a little different. But that's why I liked it.  Krissa wants a baby so much, and Derek, her husband goes along with it, but he reacts horribly every time there's a negative pregnancy test. Derek's attitude gets worse and worse. I felt bad for him the first chapter or so, but as I went on, I disliked him more and more. He's selfish and emotionally abusive, whether he or Krissa realize it.  Do I wonder why she stays with him? Absolutely.Enter Nate, an emotionally disconnected man, who's lost his wife in an accident years ago, and has now gotten sick and has bad eyesight that he's not sure he'll regain. For a man who's life is about photography, it doesn't go well with him. He comes to stay with Derek and Krissa, and  knows very little about what he's coming to. The tension arises immediately when he's there because of their marital problems and Derek pulling a disappearing act all the time.Is this story going to be for everyone? maybe, or maybe not.  I enjoyed it. I like stories that are outside the normal. The author takes a subject that isn't the norm for a romance book and finds a way to make it emotional, dramatic, and amazing at the same time.

$REVIEW.: Kaye Dacus has done it again! I had such fun revisiting the fictional town of Bonneterre, Louisiana and spending time with her great cast of characters


The biggest thrill was that party planner Meredith Guidry and executive chef Major O'hara, whom readers met briefly in Dacus's delightful debut novel, Stand-in Groom, get a story all their own.Meredith has been secretly in love with Major for eight l-o-n-g years
Both work for her parents' mega firm, which puts them in the other's path on a daily basis
She's his boss, so she has to keep things professional and accept the fact that they're just friends
Her heart protests regularly, making for an intense struggle

In an act borne of desperation, she asks God to help her get over Major and find the man of her dreams.Unbeknownst to Meredith, Major is crazy about her and wishes he could make her his wife


However, he harbors a secret he's afraid would ruin everything

Not only that, but he's been offered the chance to open his own restaurant and feels it would be unfair to ask her to be his when he'd be working more hours than ever


When Mere meets a handsome contractor who's not only remodeling her house but building a relationship with the woman Major loves, he's forced to make a choice

Will he fulfill his lifelong dream, or will he take a risk, trust Mere with the truth and concoct a Menu for Romance?Dacus tells a wonderful story, one I thoroughly enjoyed from first page to last


Her characters are captivating
I fell hard for Major and admired Meredith's dedication and determination

And yet I hurt for these two who so obviously want to be together but are kept apart by circumstances they must overcome
Only when they deal with their difficulties and look to God for the answer to their dilemma, can they find peace in His plan for their lives
I heartily recommend Menu for Romance, the second in the Bride of Bonneterre Series, as a story that is sure to satisfy your appetite for a good read.

$review_text.: I enjoyed the story. I'm pretty notorious for skimming but the characters were interesting and the story flowed so well that before  I knew it, I had reached the ending of the story without the need to skip parts.  There were misunderstandings but not the ridiculous kind that get out of hand. Overall it's a cute and easy read with wonderful characters.This is my first story from this author and I will be looking forward to reading more.

$review_text.: Lewis and Max meet when they start Uni

They are flat mates along with 3 other guys


Max is openly gay
Lewis has suspected he was gay and was never quite sure, but when he meets Max, he is extremely attracted to him
Max and Lewis end up hooking up, but Max decides they should just be friends
Lewis tries to distance himself from Max


By the time Max decides he wants more than friendship with Lewis, will it be too late?I loved this book

These guys were awesome together


They had such great chemistry and a good connection
I loved all the other roommates as well
Lewis and Max, just fit well together


I was sad to see their story end


My only complaint is I wanted more scenes of them as a couple

Maybe the author will write a novella for them
Fingers crossed ;)This is my 1st book by this author, but it won't be my last

I wish she had more college aged books
This is my favorite age :)

$SUMMARY.: Awesome read. I love Max and Lewis!! &lt;3

$REVIEW.: Just when I think S.E
Hall can&#8217;t top the amazingness that is Dane Kendrick or Evan Allen, she goes and makes us fall head over heels in love with Sawyer Beckett


As soon as you open the book, prepare to surrender your panties to Sawyer
He&#8217;s the perfect package


He&#8217;s walking sex, his inner monologue is hilarious, he knows what girls like, and his best side is the inside
Cheesy, I know

But, he has the biggest heart behind all that tattooed, pierced, muscle-y hotness

He is loyal, caring, knows exactly what to say, and goes above and beyond for the people he cares about


What&#8217;s not to love about him?&#8220;Because from the day I first saw you until the day I saw you again, I didn&#8217;t like where I was
Now you&#8217;re here and I do


So it stands to reason that staying with you, wherever it is we&#8217;re going, is my best course.&#8221;I can&#8217;t say much about the plot without spoiling anything, so here&#8217;s a vague outline

In the prologue, we are reminded that Sawyer saw Emmett at Parker&#8217;s bachelor party


She was a terrible stripper, and Sawyer is immediately drawn to her

Unfortunately, they were unable to talk that night and Sawyer has no way of tracing her


Fast forward to see Sawyer banging his pain

He goes through countless girls to try to erase the emptiness he feels inside


He can&#8217;t stop thinking about the girl who got away.&#8220;I have no idea why it takes some couples years to fall in love and some only a day, or if any of them even know


But I do know that I like you, so much
I want to know you, and I think you want the same thing.&#8221;They finally meet again, at one of Sawyer&#8217;s not-so-finest moments


It&#8217;s pretty funny

And pretty soon, she gets a job at the K, the Club Dane owns and Sawyer manages

But, it&#8217;s not smooth sailing from there
It might have been love at first sight for Sawyer, however, Emmett has her secrets
The sexual tension builds as Emmett tries to resist Sawyer despite their obvious chemistry


I loved the build-up, but even more I loved watching them let go of their inner demons and slowly fall in love with each other.&#8220;I told you


I warned you, Sawyer, don&#8217;t give me your heart.&#8221;&#8220;I know you did, and I&#8217;m not pressuring you, but some things you can&#8217;t call the shots on
I&#8217;m not sure if I gave you my heart or if you stole it, but either way, I don&#8217;t want it back.&#8221;I felt like the plot line for Entice was a lot heavier and even more emotional than its predessors in the Evolve series

I think it might just be that S.E


Hall&#8217;s writing is getting even better
I don&#8217;t remember laughing this much with the other books
It might be because the book switches between Sawyer and Emmett&#8217;s POVs, and Sawyer is downright hysterical

This book put my heart through the wringer for sure
It was full of ups and downs, and the best part was that they were real-life problems

It was just too easy to empathize and fall in love with Sawyer and Emmett.&#8220;You scare the s*** out of me beautiful Emmett, with how fast, how hard you completely mesmerized me


One day you might figure out I&#8217;m an ass and run screaming, but I&#8217;ll chance it


I&#8217;ll risk anything to keep myself by your side as long as possible.&#8221;I don&#8217;t know if I can classify Sawyer and Emmett&#8217;s relationship as insta-love or a friends to lovers story

But I think it&#8217;s both, If you read Emerge and Embrace, you would know how S.E, makes her characters fall in love
She shows that there&#8217;s some sort of inexplicable pull between the two characters, but she lets you come on the journey with them as they fall in love fast and hard
I love it.&#8220;You don&#8217;t need me to save you, Sawyer.&#8221;&#8220;You&#8217;re right
I don&#8217;t
You already did


And I&#8217;d love nothing more than the chance to show you what I can be.&#8221;&#8220;You already did.&#8221;&#8220;Oh, Em, you have no idea

There&#8217;s so much more I want to show you.&#8221;Sawyer makes a complete 180 in this book

It&#8217;s unbelievable how once Emmett comes into his life, he changes from a boy to a man


He did a lot of growing up in this book

Of course there are other factors which make that possible, but those are spoilers

I definitely swooned over the things he said and did for Emmett

And, god, is he sexy

I can&#8217;t even


All I have to say is: DJ Booth


Read it to find out what I&#8217;m talking about
Oh, and all his nicknames for Emmett? Swoon, swoon, swoon
Freaking killed me with all those terms of endearment.&#8220;The thought of losing him is suffocating, a sadness so bone deep I can&#8217;t take a full breath
I don&#8217;t even remember who I was before I let him in anymore
I don&#8217;t think I ever want to
The only Emmett I want to be is his Emmett.&#8221;Emmett was more of an enigma


Sawyer wears his heart on his sleeve, but Emmett is a lot more guarded
It takes a while for her to open up to Sawyer, and even when she does, she keeps thinking that she could never deserve a guy like Sawyer and that he&#8217;ll be leaving soon
Once we learn her reason for thinking like that, it makes a lot more sense, however, all it does before that is cause more sexual tension (no complaints here)
I admired Emmett&#8217;s strength and her determination


It&#8217;s no wonder Sawyer fell in love with her so quickly


She is just as selfless and caring as Sawyer is.&#8220;I knew the minute I saw you that you&#8217;d be the end of me

I was right

You&#8217;re it


You&#8217;re all I see

You&#8217;re all I think about
I love you, Emmett.&#8221;And of course, we get to catch up with the Crew

One of my favorite circles of friends


I get to see my fave, the adorable Evan, and his love, the equally adorable, Whitley


And we get to see more of caveman Dane, and the most stubborn woman alive, Laney

I loved seeing how much they&#8217;ve grown up in the past year or so
They&#8217;re just as close-knit and entertaining as ever
I will be sad when we eventually have to see them go.&#8220;Thank you
Thank you for being exactly who you are and loving me exactly how you do.&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about all that, but I will always love you the best I know how.&#8221;Evan will always be my favorite Evolve boy, but I know for a fact, that everyone is going to fall in love with Sawyer


We get to see him in a completely different light in this book


Who knows, maybe we&#8217;ll get some people to convert to Team Sawyer which means less competition for me for Evan

Sawyer and Emmett are so perfect together, even when they forget it

They bring out the best in each other, and their love is the kind that changes lives
I was extremely pleased with how this book turned out, and I congratulate S.E

Hall on creating yet another story of finding yourself and falling in love.&#8220;The only way I know how to give all I am to one person is the way I am with you

So babe, I&#8217;m kind of a work in progress, but I&#8217;m your work in progress


Only yours, ever, forever


I don&#8217;t want to be away from you, Em
I don&#8217;t want to miss another thing.&#8221;

It follows the quickly-getting-old formula of damaged young people falling in love and trying to save each other that has been done so much better by Colleen Hoover, Jessica Park, Jamie McGuire, and others. I paged through the last quarter of the book just to see it come to its obvious conclusion-the set up for book two!  I won't be in line for that one.

$REVIEW.: JLA: THE NAIL is a 1998 Elseworlds offering. For those not in the know, DC's Elseworlds line, much like Marvel Comics' What If series, takes superheroes out of their mainstream continuity and tweaks them into a new context and into an alternative history. This allows comic book writers and artists the freedom to dream up dynamic (even disturbing) twists that the corporate high muck-a-mucks normally wouldn't condone with their established cash cow titles. JLA: THE NAIL tells of what the DC universe would be like if it had no Man of Steel in it.JLA: THE NAIL posits that, on that fateful day Jonathan and Martha Kent would've chanced upon an alien infant in a rocketship, they instead suffer a flat tire, which forces them to stay home at their farm. Thus, there is no Clark Kent and no Superman. Cut to many years later now, and the Justice League of America is active in their superheroics. But this isn't a League looked on with favor and admiration by the average bloke, and even the League members tend to sharply bicker amongst themselves. Without Superman's inspirational impact on his fellow crimefighters and, especially, on the general public, metahumans are perceived as untrustworthy and dangerous. There's even a rumor floating around that metahumans are actually alien invaders in disguise.Then a fatal incident involving Batman enflames the public's xenophobia to a boiling point, and the capes find themselves struggling for their very liberty and lives. Acting on the gnawing suspicion that someone is manipulating events and triggering the fear and unrest amongst the populace, the Justice League desperately investigate. But there are serious losses and repercussions to be shouldered. And when the shadowy culprit is at last unmasked, it turns out that the League seriously lacks the might and wherewithal to even put up a credible resistance.It's gotten to the point now that every time I see the names of Alan Davis and his longtime inker Mark Farmer on a title, I just shell out the money. Davis's track record has been exemplary, going back to his Captain Britain and Marvelman days. With Farmer, he produced amazing illustrations on EXCALIBUR and, most recently, onFantastic Four: The End. So, yes, I'm sold on these two not only as artists but as storytellers. JLA: THE NAIL, compiling the 3 issue limited series in one trade paperback, showcases this team's reliably polished, jawdropping art, as well as one hell of an interesting story.It doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize that the world is a far better place with a Superman watching over it. In Superman's absence Alan Davis unveils a grimmer, more cynical, more perilous world, with the lunatics that much closer to running the asylum. Speaking of nutjobs, Joker plays an instrumental part in making things take a turn for the worse for our heroes. In this darker reality, Luthor has amassed massive political influence and receives full support from Perry White and Jimmy Olsen.I would've said that Alan Davis goes wild with this concept, if I haven't already read his sequelJustice League of America: Another Nail (Elseworlds)(in which Davis gets cosmic and goes really ballistic). As it is, with this one, he throws a lot of stuff at you but keeps it from getting too confusing. The pace is relentless, with several story arcs going on simultaneously. The current JLA lineup comprises of the Martian Manhunter, the Atom, the Flash (Barry Allen), Green Lantern (Hal Jordan), the Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and Hawkwoman. These superfolks are exquisitely visually rendered, with Alan Davis indulging in spectacular splash pages for each JLA member. Character-wise, Davis doesn't try to do anything revolutionary, doesn't stray too far from the mold, although Green Arrow is now more bitter and Batman more tortured and driven (there are extenuating circumstances). We also see an angry Hawkwoman more in line with the JLA animated series version. Sorry to say I find Aquaman, the Atom, and Hal Jordan to be still somewhat boring characters. However, the Flash versus Amazo sequence is sure to elicit cheers from the Flash supporters.But Davis doesn't stop with the JLA. He introduces plenty of guest stars, other superhero groups and various supernatural and near-immortal entities. On the more mortal side, Catwoman and the Kents (sans Clark) also have prominent supporting roles. The main villain was quite a surprise (I'm still not sure if I'm disappointed or not). On the other hand, I did have a glimmer of how the day was probably gonna be saved. Overall, JLA: THE NAIL is a ridiculously satisfying comic book read, and, if you know your DC history, there's even a pretty interesting 7-paged afterword by Alan Davis. Davis and Mark Farmer once again demonstrate that they make a formidable storytelling team. So if you happen to see their names on some title you've never heard of, just go ahead and shell out the money. It'll be the best bunch of dollars you'll spend that month.

$REVIEW.: I was intrigued by this book after watching the film by Sam Raimi, The Possession. This book tells the tale of the events surrounding the Dibbuk Box. The origins of the box start at an estate sale in Oregon to an ebay purchase of the mysterious &#8216;wine cabinet&#8217; also known as the Dibbuk Box. The author Jason Haxton, a curator of a museum in a small Missouri town becomes obsessed with the box and its history. The book explores the details of a cursed item and how it effects the person in possession of said box. Jason keeps very detailed records of everything pertaining to the box, so much so that I occasional doubt the validity of this &#8216;true story&#8217;.However even though I am pretty sure the entire thing was a hoax, it was a very elaborate and well written and performed hoax! So if you can keep an open mind and just enjoy the ride, it&#8217;s worth the price of admission.I can&#8217;t give away too much in details or it will ruin it, but at the end it is up to you to decide whether you think it was real or a hoax.It&#8217;s an interesting read whether or not you believe. If you have seen the film The Possession, I would recommend the book.

$review_text.: Brynda was sick or dying I should say until she is taken by her true mate, Jek. Her sickness was advanced, but when she is taken by Jek, she is healed and is worried about where she is. This situation leads to an interesting read. I always love when I'm reading this series and when the men uses the necklace to communicate to their mates once they are captured. Once the necklace is around their mate's neck, they are  mated for life and they are unable to take it off. This was a good read and I loved it and the series.

It is easy to read and it treats MJ and his children respectfully.  it emphasizes MJ's  separation from his family, his lack of friendships, his isolation from real life and the sad limitations that mega fame put on him.The book sums it up on page 225 : MJ had bodyguards, lawyers and maids but he had nobody who gave a f*** about Michael Jackson.Poor MJ.  I wish that he could have found a good wife and built a solid, wholesome life, enjoying the fruits of his hard work.This book leaves you sad.

$REVIEW.: ** This review contains a quote at the end which may be considered slightly spoilerish **My expectation was that I wouldn't enjoy the story and wouldn't like the characters due to the infidelity - actually that sounds a bit silly given that I bought the book to read! :) However, I really, really liked this book.I loved both Andrew and Nathan. I didn't necessarily like all their actions or agree with their decisions, but I found myself quite passionately wanting them to get together.The books was interesting to read. The journey was not necessarily a happy one. There was lots of heartache and Andrew and Nathan weren't together most of the time. There were a couple of moments where the story looked to take one path but diverted to another, keeping me turning the pages to find out want happens next.The secondary characters were varied and interesting - children, wives, ex-wives, in-laws, best friends, neighbours, lovers. Everyone seemed to have an opinion on the relationship.Although I found it hard to understand why Nathan didn't just bite the bullet and leave his wife, his confusion and indecision was clear. He was worried about his very young children (Daniel and Jess) and his career but the person he seemed to be hurting the most was himself. "For too long now, Nathan had only felt alive when he was bathed in the warmth of Daniel and Jess or in the blazing light that was Andrew."It was also easy to feel sympathetic towards Andrew whose overbearing parents had forced the direction his life had taken. He had spent his life trying to do the right thing by his wife and son. At the beginning of the book he is living with his wife and son and supporting them, but it was a marriage in name only. He was honest with his wife.The love and passion between the two men was obvious and their journey a very hard one but with the outcome I was hoping for.4.5 stars"This will be difficult, and I'm not going to say it'll be unicorns and rainbows. I've just got my head about being bi and I'm having a  hard time coping with that, but I am in love with you. Living away from my kids is the hardest thing I've ever done, but you're not asking me to do it. I'm finally making that decision for myself. I love you, and we've waited too damn long to be together.""Then we'll find the unicorns and rainbows." Andrew pulled Nathan into his arms again, kissing his lips, his wet eyes, the tear-tracks down his cheeks."

$review_text.: CUTE!!! Anyone who is a fan, or not a fan, of the Bachelor/Bachelorette Series will enjoy this book. London and Beau are partnered up in their Communications class to prove that the show &#34;Love Match&#34; is fake. They recreate the lavish dates (as best they can as college students) from each week's show then blog about it. Unfortunately for Beau and London, their hypothesis is wrong&#8230;&#8230;..because they begin to have feelings for each other. But London doesn't want to risk their grade, so they're forced to pretend they aren't falling for each other.There were so many great things about the book. I loved Beau. He was so sweet and adventurous. He showed London what the true College Experience was all about. London spent her entire 4 years at UNC Chapel Hill in the theatre, never going to a basketball game, or a karaoke bar, never living the carefree life of a College kid. London was great. She's funny, talented and a loyal friend. The supporting characters helped make the story enjoyable as well.A sweet, funny, charming and witty love story.

$REVIEW.: This book starts off good, it appears. My daughter started it spring of her 3rd grade. We gave up on it winter of the next year with the typical summer break.The assignments seem fun at first, but then it just gets monotonous with little real guidance.We switched to SonLight's Language Arts program co-developed with Dr. Ruth Beechick (The 3 R's). It's so much easier with well thought out guidance. My 2nd grader is dictating (still working on penmanship) full paragraphs! Writing Strands schedule feels overwhelming when you get into more substantial assignments. SL's is broken down into child friendly portions easily completed in 10-20 minutes, and really the most time consuming is the child's physiological struggles with penmanship.5/2011 We have moved on, yet again. I found the SL curriculum lacking guidance for me and my kids. There is no instruction on how to write outlines. I was avoiding the lessons. The dictation exercises (we made them copy work) gave no real results. They just seem like busy work. We are now using IEW Institute for Excellence in Writing and loving it! I purchased the kids curriculum and an all important teacher's guide (both include dvd's). This one is a keeper.

$review_text.: I love Victorian period dramas.  As I was just sliding off a high induced by the Encore miniseries The Crimson Petal and the White, based on the 2002 novel by Michel Faber (which I am dying to read),  I chanced upon The Whores' Asylum by Katy Darby. Published in 2012 by Penguin, this is the debut novel of a young woman who teaches writing in England as I do in California, but that is not why I fell in love with her book.The Whores' Asylum is aptly titled, with a pretty cover, and in fact has a couple of engaging, colorful whores in it, yet it does not fit genre expectations.  It is an intelligent study of the human heart rather than the narrative of a clever whore who raises herself up and escapes from misery in Victorian England. (By no means am I trivializing the referred-to miniseries; I only mean The Whores' Asylum is a labyrinthine sanctuary where the reader must get lost to find meaning. It's a delightful book to get lost in.)Darby gives the amiable narrator's voice to one Dr. Edward Fraser whose affinities and friendships set the entire tone of the novel.  At the outset, young Fraser has not determined whether to follow his proclivities for righteousness or his fascination for the classical past. It is significant that he has already achieved a Bachelor of Arts in Theology from Cambridge with first class honors and is now pursuing a Master's in Philosophy at Oxford. Fraser is no simpleton.  This character, far more layered than Holmes' Watson and definitely more significant to the plot, tells of his great friendship for Stephen Chapman, a young man studying medicine. Chapman and Fraser are good for each other; they room together in Oxford, sharing their lives, dreams and aspirations with each other. Since the novel is told in hindsight, Fraser wants to explain why Chapman died in such hideous manner, and make amends for his failings, if he can, by so doing.One of Darby's delightful ploys is to play a trick on readers who may, for instance, be likely to judge Fraser as a prude. We are, after all, of the 21st century and do not see things as British society did back in Victorian times.  There are other judgments the reader may make which I do not feel inclined to give away.  At the very least, the reader will be likely to find young Fraser too judgmental in his view of the young woman with whom Chapman has fallen in love. Still, there is no doubt that Fraser's friendship is sincere and he tries to do right by Chapman. The reader is free to disagree with Fraser's point of view on any number of topics or plot twists, and that disagreement is, I believe, something Darby engineers with skill.The characters in The Whores' Asylum develop as they are supposed to in serious, prize-winning literature. More than anyone else, the layers of Diana/Anna and Fraser are peeled back over and over, until the person finally seated on the couch beside the reader--they are that alive--is not the one the reader had an opinion about at the beginning or even halfway through the novel. I blushed next to Edward Fraser, hoping he would forgive me for my judgments. Through the metamorphoses, the plot keeps us hooked and the changes are all believable.I can see why Darby titled this novel The Unpierced' Heart in its first incarnation, for the overall story is about judgments and choices made around, for and about love. The Whores' Asylum is set against a background of rich Gothic trappings and told in a strong, literary Victorian voice. I cannot wait to see what Darby writes next.

$review_text.: I absolutely loved this story. The Bullet series is one of my all time favorites. Jade C. Jamison did an amazing writing Brad's story. I was a wreck after reading Bullet and Rock Bottom but this was the hardest one for me to read. It pulled every single emotion out of me, I laughed, I cried, and at times I wanted to throw my kindle across the room.Fully Automatic takes us through Brad's life before he meets Valerie past the point where Rock Bottom ended. We get a look into Brad's previous relationships and get a better understanding of why he keeps fighting for Val. I have been a huge fan of Brad since reading Bullet. I always felt that Brad and Val belonged together and I felt so bad that it took her so long to realize that her true love had been by her side the entire time. It was hard to watch Brad struggle with his relationship with Val and Ethan when he knew he was who she was truly meant to be with. His pain and heartbreak was gut wrenching.&#8220;I know you&#8217;re into Ethan, and as long as you are, nothing&#8217;s gonna happen between us. But I want you to know I&#8217;ll wait.&#8221;&#8220;He could feel what she was feeling. It was deep and soulful, and there were no words for it. It wasn&#8217;t just love. It was more than that. It was deeper than anything he&#8217;d ever known, and he know then that it wasn&#8217;t just him. She felt it too.&#8221;Brad is also the driving force behind his bands success and the glue that keeps them all together. He pushes them to do better for themselves and each other. Ethan is a very lucky guy to have a friend and &#34;brother&#34; like Brad who stuck by his side through everything. I often wondered how Brad was able to stand by and watch Ethan treat Val they way he did and keep his cool for so long. I was happy to see that everything worked out in the end and Brad and Val finally got the HEA they both deserved. He has a successful band, a beautiful wife, and two kids who love him to pieces. What more could a guy ask for. I can't wait to read Nick and Zane's stories. Keep on rocking Jade!!
$SUMMARY.: Love Brad!!

The book is, essentially, the same as the video, but also includes bios of the participants and the recipes from some of the meals shown on the video.  I have been following the program for about 3 weeks, and I have never felt better.  I believe that the program is a valid life choice, and I can't wait to get to my doctor to see what changes have occurred internally. All in all, it's a sound program, a life choice, not a fad diet, so it's better for you long term.  It also answered questions I had about a vegetarian/vegan life style.  I recommend it to anyone who is looking for an alternative to animal protein for whatever reason.

$REVIEW.: Broken Sigil is a rather original supernatural horror novel by author William Meikle (author of Crustaceans, The Ravine, Night Of The Wendigo, The Hole).  What I enjoyed about this story is that although much seemed familiar at first look, Meikle kept me interested by his original world-building, crafting rules to an occult that seemed fresh and unexplored.  The atmosphere was fairly effective as well.More details into the mythology of the house might have given the story more clarity, but being a novella, I can let that go.  His main character was well crafted and the relationship and connection with his partner engaging.  But in the end, this was, essentially, like a good episode of Tales From The Crypt, with nothing too surprising.  The ending felt a bit rushed and wrapped up too quickly and conveniently, if not downright predictable.  But overall, this is a decent recommendation from a solid storyteller.

$review_text.: The cover art pulled me in- it looks great
The book was suggested to me through Amazon's "you might like this" page


And I did!As some other's pointed out there were some spelling issues ("mane" instead of "man", "he" instead of "she") and some Kindle text changes (some whole sections would go italics and then back to regular) but that could be just Kindle formatting and not necessarily the author's fault- I've seen that before).But- like another reviewer pointed out- the story was pretty awesome and I basically ignored the mistakes and kept on reading because I enjoyed the pace and flow of the story

I tend to overlook little errors here and there if the story is good, and it was, so I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 3 in this case

I hope that a future edition irons out some of the small issues, but all in all, a really entertaining read.

$REVIEW.: In the Appalachian town of Barkersville, a mysterious man with red eyes shows up
A town where the dead don't always stay dead, the community has barely gotten over the horrific events the McFall family brought upon them five years ago


McFall is a not so classic tale of good versus evil


Larkin McFall wants to give the people what they want, but at what expense? What's the going rate for a soul nowadays?McFall was my first peek into Nicholson's work


I was apprehensive at having not read The Red Church or Drummer Boy prior to McFall
However, my only disappointment was that I read them out of sequence

McFall was a great standalone read, and while his previous works have definitely made it to my future list of reads, I didn't feel it was necessary to read them in order to understand this one.Outside of my normal genre, McFall had me intrigued and wanting more in the first few pages

Originally released as a Kindle serial, the book is now complete and available as a whole

Nicholson uses a good portion of the book to build believable characters and settings

Usually, I would balk at the lack of action but he did such a fantastic job of setting the stage


My only wish is that Nicholson would have given us more details about McFall; what he was, what led him to town, his ultimate end-game

With all the time devoted to character development, Larkin McFall felt underdeveloped

Of course, this could have been intentional to leave readers continually questioning his motives.Ronnie Day, now eighteen was the standout character for me

Clearly damaged from his past, he battles inwardly to maintain his faith and be the &#34;good&#34; that stands up to evil as the townsfolk give into temptation one by one
This poor kid always seemed to be in the wrong place at all the wrong times.I remain on the fence about the choice of titling the book McFall

Being my first foray into the series, I originally thought it was going to be the name of a town
The focus seems to be less about McFall and more about other characters and Barkersville itself


That being said, I enjoyed the book


While it wasn't non-stop action, the mystery of it all kept me interested from start to finish and I'm hoping to see more of these characters in the future
I definitely recommend McFall to readers who enjoy Stephen Kings eerie work, and appreciate Nicholson finding The Bookie Monster and sharing this great read with me.

$REVIEW.: Luckily, on the occasions when we find ourselves under fire for our own personal choices or the choices of our ancestors, which is what political correctness demands from anyone born male, blasphemers like myself can find sanctuary in Steven E. Rhoads's delightful new book, Taking Sex Differences Seriously. Upon finishing Rhoads's work, many readers will discover that they have renewed respect for the nature of women, and, perhaps, unexpected esteem for the nature of men.I should warn that Taking Sex Differences Seriously is not a chatty, self-help book. It is a highly erudite work in which the author examines study after study and author after author, yet, at the same time, it is very accessible (just as was the case with Why Men Don't Iron). It was written with the average person in mind even though it voluminously surveys contemporary scholarship. There is less focus here on statistics and experimental procedure than there is in works like The New Science of Intimate Relationships, The Mating Mind, or The Red Queen.The study of sex difference can be quite precarious for the academic, and it is with some relief that I noted that Rhoads already has put in thirty years of service at the University of Virginia. For those without tenure, such a book could spell unemployment. The author cites the opinions of heavyweights like Gloria Steinem and Gloria Allred on the topic of sex research. They believe that making inquiries into the discrepancies between men and women is downright dangerous to all women and anti-American in spirit [!]. Yet, one could make a strong case that unearthing what others purposefully ignore is intrinsic to what it means to be an American.The real question that most people have is not that differences are present but for what purpose do these variations exist? Central to Rhoads's work, and central to evolutionary psychology in general, is the fact that the biological drives of humans were formed long ago in a time known as the "environment of evolutionary adaptation." This period embodied "99 percent of hominid existence." Back then there were no hotels, no indoor plumbing, no antibiotics, no birth control pills or abortions, and certainly no cushy jobs which involved clacking away at keyboards. Survival was precarious and most of our current preferences evolved from our ancestors adapting to life in a brutal and unsavory setting.Only in today's world have we reached the levels of luxury and comfort where we can mistakenly assert that men and women want identical outcomes from love, sex, and life. This false assumption is a cause for considerable unhappiness in our interpersonal relations.Where Rhoads succeeds is through his presentation of all views and his relentless attempts to explain human behavior. He ignores nothing and shares with the reader many a citation which does not support his case. One would be wise to remember that the goal of evolutionary psychology is to illuminate the basis for human behavior and not to excuse or condone such behaviors. To describe is not to advocate. We embrace fantasy over fact if we deny that gender exerts an influence on the way we act, but, unfortunately, that is exactly what many universities around the country have done through their creation of women's studies programs and their never-ending fetish for describing the world as they want it to be rather than how it actually is.

$review_text.: Sometimes you get exactly what you need in a book! I&#8217;ve been looking forward to this new release by Susan Mac Nicol, you all know I love her writing, but this new novel was just spot on. I needed something real, loving, fun, sexy, and completely captivating. That&#8217;s exactly what Waiting for Rain has been for me. It&#8217;s my new favorite book by this amazing author. Then again, each of her new releases becomes my new favorite&#8230;When we first meet Toby, he seems a very put together, posh, cultured, maybe a bit stuck up young man. A promising career awaits him and he&#8217;s surrounded by friends and colleagues who love and appreciate him. The more one gets to know him, the more they realize he&#8217;s a survivor, a foster kid who&#8217;s been to hell and back, a professional who&#8217;s been forged to the ugliest fires of the hotel industry, a loving, kind, beautiful soul that no one can help falling in love with.Enters Rain, who falls into the same trap, despite his attempts to keep everything casual and not get involved. In what family and background are concerned, South Africa born Rain is Toby&#8217;s opposite. He has a loving family, friends he&#8217;s known a long time, but he&#8217;s been hurt deeply by the man he once loved.These two seem exactly what the other need, although their relationship is not an easy one. Real danger, ghosts from the past, personal fears, they will have to face it all. While definitely not as dark as some of Susan&#8217;s other books, Waiting for Rain is very real! There are serious issues being debated, from foster care life for orphans, to discrimination, and hate crimes against the LGBT community and the twisted individuals who try to defend them.Rain&#8217;s unique phobia was a work of art, I couldn&#8217;t stop laughing and it was the middle of the night! Also, the pole dancing angle was extremely close to my heart, you all know that! Just watch the trailer that&#8217;s a bit lower down the page and tell me you don&#8217;t like it, I dare you. Rain&#8217;s exhibitionist side was brilliantly worked into the novel, and put to good use, as his dancing ends up raising money for a good cause.All in all, a beautiful, inspiring, heart warming read that I recommend to anyone who enjoys a great love story. This might be a novel about a gay couple, but first and foremost it&#8217;s a story of love.

I would have to say that my new favorite is now " Adversaries into Allies" for many reasons: What I like about this book is it touches on all levels of what Bob Burg teaches from the basis of where it all starts: Communication.  Communication 101 without the depths of where he goes in communication and where he touches upon the area of self, we don't go anywhere as human beings in relationships, business,, sales etc... I am thrilled to see Bob Burg touching over  into the self development area in his writing. Yes he is excellent at sales, negotiating, however I think he is also excellent at motivation and self development writing as well.

If you collect art books like I do I would say definitely buy this one. The artwork is just amazing!!! If I could give this more than 5 stars, I definitely would.This book doesn't teach you how to become a better artist. It just shows a collection of artwork from some of the best artists. I don't mind if an art book doesn't teach me any new techniques as long as the artwork in the book somehow inspires me to become a better artist. This book makes me want to practice harder so that someday I could be as good as these artists.I would recommend this book to teens and adults but not children. I also own almost all the other Udon Entertainment art books and I would like to take the time to recommend them all. In my opinion Udon is just the best of the best. I don't work for them. I don't get paid by them. I'm just a fan of their art books.

It also explains other types of people, as well, and shows us who complements our strengths and who we need to avoid. Great for understanding people in business, families, marriages, churches etc.  It's a Wall Street Journal Bestseller for a reason.

$review_text.: I stumbled upon Wright's 'Feral Sins' awhile ago and after reading it checked out her other works. I really enjoyed 'Here Be Sexiest Vampire' and was pleased when I heard she was working on a sequel. I bought and downloaded this book as soon as it was released (shortly after midnight, I LOVE my kindle), and proceeded to devour this book. I was not disappointed! The characters were just as great as in the first book and I liked that Wright focused a little bit more on Jared's past this time around. The story was interesting, well developed, and fun. I can guarantee that I'll now buy any written work by this author!

$REVIEW.: This is a delightful novella that is best served with a warm drink and a smile on your face, though the latter is most assuredly guaranteed through Regan Walker&#8217;s simplistic prose and interesting characterization.Christopher St. Ives, Viscount Eustace, is a bored rake. While his closest friend, the Marquess of Ormond, enjoys his life as a happily married man, Christopher only experiences a perpetual ennui with his activities. To shake up his world, Ormond proposes a wager &#8211; that for a thousand pounds Christopher will seduce the virtuous widow, Lady Leisterfield, bed her, and leave her, all before Twelfth Night. Wanting to refresh his memory of the beautiful widow, Christopher agrees and plots his seduction.Unfortunately for him, Ormond&#8217;s wife has already informed Grace, Lady Leisterfield, of the offensive wager, before his first move.  Grace is mentally prepared for his rakish behaviors, but she was not prepared to find a humorous and kind friend in him, or to form a companionship with him that warmed the lonely alcove of her life. But when a blackmailer threatens to expose secrets in Grace&#8217;s life, will Christopher become her knight-in-shining-armor?As expected, the focus of this story is on Christopher, rather than Grace. While Grace exhibits a lovely, serene aura that draws Christopher in, it is his eventual acceptance of defeat that brings him to love&#8217;s embrace. As Christopher protects Grace from her blackmailer, he began to fall in love with her, but the wager and his pride became his opponents in securing her love. From Grace&#8217;s perspective, it is understandable how easy she fell in love with Christopher and gave herself to him, but her own insecurities prevented her from declaring her love, to the point that she pushed him away for self-protection. The external conflict seemingly took a turn into a mysterious direction, but for its purpose as a catalyst, the author wisely left it in the background. It was always the combination of internal conflicts that prevented Christopher and Grace from being together, but in the end, a bit of Cupid-work from their friends and the cheerfulness of the Christmas season effectively banished their fears and led to a romantic ideal.The airiness of this story is its most engaging quality, the way that the protagonists slowly felt more comfortable with each other surrounded by a bevy of fun, supportive friends. Grace&#8217;s gift was to fill that emotional gap missing in Christopher&#8217;s erstwhile purposeless life, and his gift was to infuse warmth and passion in Grace&#8217;s life, a life that, while not empty, had always been very lonely. While the story is not passionately sensuous, nor showcased a love of desperate qualities, it is nonetheless a fulfilling and heartwarming story to warm up readers from the inside during the winter months.*I received a review copy from the author in exchange for an honest review

$review_text.: If you buy this book expecting to read about future Earth Space Navies battling Alien Empires and want techno-thriller type details of advanced weaponry and space battles, you will be highly disappointed! This is basically Erotic Fantasy that occurs within a Science Fiction matrix. The story involves a kidnapped Earth woman who ends up the &#34;property&#34; of &#34;quad&#34; alien brothers who amazingly turn out to be enlarged versions of beefcake human &#34;studs&#34; who are pretty much superior in every way to the human male versions(and I mean in every way). If you are one who likes sci-fi but would strongly question the likelihood that an earth woman and 4 alien brothers would be, ahem, &#34;compatible&#34; in the erotic area, then this would not be the book for you. HOWEVER, if those kinds of details do not bother you and you enjoy reading highly detailed erotic literature, then this book is right up your alley(so to speak)!

$review_text.: Okay, I am a white 60 year old woman, but most importantly, a reader of anything I can find.I started out with the first Oprah review, and then watched her final interview with him. If I like an author, I generally read everything they have written. And so it began.  Just months after losing my 36 year old son to suicide, I read Million Little Pieces to find out about addiction, then I read the 'Testament" book.  Well, I was spellbound and couldn't put either book down until complete.  Then, wondering if I am indeed agnostic, read his latest, then assured myself that I still am.  I believe this book could offend the religious and cause concerns towards the author. I am almost finished with My Friend Leonard and can't put it down but then decided to put my two cents in... I need to know more about this Mr. Frey.  Who is he?  What was the book he read and said it changed his life?  He wanted to write a book that would do it for others.  Well, considering the way he put forth his words, he made a definite mark on my soul. I hope he continues to write novels like these.  Does his group of writers have anything to do with each of the characters in the Testament? Sometimes his writing seems different with each character, so I wondered if the book was collaborative. I can say with honesty, his books are different, compelling, challenging and very informative on the specific subjects.

$REVIEW.: I got this book for my nephew but I wanted to read it first, just to make sure it wouldn&#8217;t be too mature for him (you never know)

I was surprised that I enjoyed the book so much!I love that it is told from Andy&#8217;s perspective, the author really nailed how it feels to be a love-sick awkward boy that just yearns to be understood
He wants so badly to fit in but he soon learns that being yourself and being unique is the key to not only acceptance by his peers but also true happiness

This is such an important lesson that many adults have yet to figure out


Accept yourself first before others can.The tragedy of losing the one person he can really confide in and who fully supports him was so hard to read but it was handled very well
Then add in the supernatural superpowers allowing Andy to speak with his grandpa again and you have an awesome story! It was so heartwarming and helped with his grief


Then in a neat twist to the plot, the girl he is in love with is in danger by an evil spirit and Andy has the ability to intervene and save her and her family


He goes from being the reserved bullied nerd to the hero, how better to get the girl&#8217;s attention?I really enjoyed this book and my nephew is currently reading it and so far he is just as glued to the pages as I was! Would definitely recommend this book to boys and girls alike, especially those that feel like outcasts or are uncomfortable in their own skin


Finding yourself is a journey and the sooner you learn the important lessons taught in this book the faster you can reach happiness.

$REVIEW.: I have a soft spot for Eusebius
This cleric came out of Diocletian's persecution alive

Survival skills he then put to good use at Constantine's court, which was a dangerous place to be, even for members of the dynasty


In the comfort of American democracy it might be hard to imagine what these circumstances can do to an individual's integrity and ambitions


But from the spot where I am coming from and who had lost relatives in the death-camps, Eusebius looks a bit like an honest Nazi


It would be as silly to reject his testimony simply because he carried the wrong membership card, as it would be silly to reject Hss's diaries as evidence for the killings in Auschwitz
As a high ranking cleric Eusebius had an obvious bias
It comes with the territory
But he did not completely lack a sense of critical insight


 After all it is Eusebius who, based on Dionysius's analysis, rejects the authenticity of "Revelations" and even names a certain Cerinthus as the actual author.! This is pretty bold, coming from a man like him, and it is reflected by Bultmanns curt treatment of &Ograve;Revelations&Oacute; in his monumental &Ograve;Theology of the New Testament.&Oacute; (See my review.) Or, to give another example, the darling of apologetic theology these days uses to be Papias's &Ograve;testimony," which wouldn't even exist without Eusebius
But it was Eusebius who called Papias "..

a man of very small intelligence, to judge from his books.&Oacute; It is interesting to see how modern scholars gingerly navigate around this verdict and stack a tower of speculations on this &Ograve;witness.&Oacute; (And what is Papias witnessing to? That he personally knew somebody who knew someone else who claimed to have seen the daughters of a nebulous apostle Phillip


Papias apparently prided himself to report hearsay and nothing but hearsay.)  So it is almost impossible to overstate the importance of Eusebius for Christian history of the first 3 centuries, because, apart from the patristic literature and earlier apolog!ists, Eusebius is practically the bottleneck of Christian traditions before Constantines edict

This is a sad fact, and we should have no illusions about the fictional character of the exodus to Pella by the Jerusalem Church after the fall of Jerusalem


However, I see no reason to doubt that the sectarians as long as they had stayed in Jerusalem, had selected their leadership from the family of their first leader

This is common practice for budding sects almost everywhere
After Mohammed's death the early Muslims recruited their leaders from the prophet's own clan


It speaks for Eusebiuss relative integrity that he felt compelled to explain the discrepancies in the Gospels genealogies

Apparently modern &Ograve;sceptics&Oacute; were not the first to put a finger on this sore

 Eusebius ascribed to the so called Arian heresy

What this meant can be expressed in one sentence: &Ograve;There is no God but God and Jesus is his prophet.&Oacute; In other words the emphasis was on Jesus human nature


Well no!t quite


This would have been the Ebionites faith, and we all know of course that Ebionites are evil heretics
Eusebius says so himself


Arius proposed a more arcane teaching that had God and the &Ograve;Logos&Oacute; (familiar from Johns gospel as the word from the beginning that turned flesh) (co-)existing from all eternity until God suddenly called into existence the Universe
Logos then took care of all the creation within the Cosmos except for &Ograve;the Son&Oacute; and mankind
This, for dessert, God Father reserved for himsel
Not what we would consider an orthodox belief these days


But by the good grace of his god, Eusebius was spared to see himself condemned (or worse) in his own lifetime

I told you he was a survivor
 My point here is not that we cannot put our trust in Eusebius alone, my point is that we have little choice
Decius and Diocletian had rounded up clerics for deportation and in a systematic fashion had collected scriptures for the shredder


Consequently we have no complete te!xt of the Christian canon from before Constantine


In fact we have barely anything complete from that period


So when the persecutions finally abated, missing scriptures needed to be replaced


The criteria and means of how this was accomplished is still a moot and little researched subject


For instance only by disassembling the fragments of Tatians &Ograve;Diatessaron&Oacute; (a harmony of the 4 canonical gospels) we get a glimpse on the state of the gospels short before 174 AD
There can be little doubt that the decades after 311 AD
had been assiduous in scriptural and apologetic fabrications of every kind and some accuse Eusebius of having participated in this industry


 I dont really know
He might, but then, he may not

One has to use critical judgement

For instance Acts 5 gives a rather typical illustration for sectarian life: With his gang of devoted thugs (the &Ograve;young men,&Oacute;) a cult-leader - Peter - enforces his rule of terror over a new sect
2 members hold back on their contrib!utions and get the treatment for backsliding
They &Ograve;mysteriously&Oacute; die


All very plausible


Has been seen before and since

So the statement deserves some credence
The same test applied on Eusebius, will leave enough to feed an academic career


Constantines vicar was a rather bright fellow and the Tyrant knew his name

We cannot choose the time where we live; Eusebius was no exception

He survived the most severe of all persecutions, he is Antiquitys first ecclesiastic historian who has reached us intact; and if he is not trustworthy, than it is time that we say good bye to that notorious Papias as well.

First of all I applaud the author for stepping out on a limb here, this isn't the type of book for everyone, and anyone who reads it will definitely have a strong opinion one way or the other.The Pros:It's a stand alone, not a series...yet.It's long, you really get a good long story for the price.It's well written and mostly well edited.The story hooks you in with lots of detail.It is extremely different from anything I have read in a long time and VERY dark.The Cons:It's hard to know whether to trust Eric or anything he says.It can be confusing at times to follow just where the author seems to want to take you.This book is quite graphic and very disturbing in certain parts. I would recommend it for an older and very open-minded audience. Well worth the price and very entertaining.

This was sci-fi in the sense that a group of terrans traveled through a worm hole to another planet, but in truth the story was more about repairing and advancing a medieval society using contemporary technology.  I found the story had some common elements with Janissaries by Niven and Pournelle, and if the reader enjoyed this book they may want to look at Janissaries as well.  I also enjoyed the romantic elements of the book and the relationship between Ryans and Deidre.  Despite the concern the author expressed in her comments at the end of the story, this was a romance without erotic content.  It was done well and tastefully.  The only thing keeping me from giving the book five stars was a tendency on several occasions throughout the book to be repetitive,  Also, the question was asked several times during the book about religion, but the question was never directly answered.  Also, some scientists were discussing the lack of calcium and where they could obtain it, when earlier in the book a melon was identified as a source of calcium.  I would definitely buy a second book in the series if one is forthcoming.

$review_text.: Easy read as far as sticking with it, but very sad that this woman had to go through so much abuse her whole childhood.  If you can handle it, the ending finally comes where she tells how God helped her through all the bad times, gave her a wonderful family of her own as an adult and she was able to be the mother she never had.  In all, a good read!

$REVIEW.: This is the first book that I have read in the Rough Riders series, and I am now moving on to the others.  I loved this book. Keely was unbelievable. I identified with her on nearly every level and I was hooked after the first chapter. Her sassy, smart-a$$ mouth and sarcastic comments had me literally laughing out loud. Other parts had me tearing up for her pain. This may have been the first in the Rough Riders series that I have read, but it won't be the last. I have some catching up to do. This specific book is definitely one I will read again.

But what makes the book valuable is brilliant questions and white space. Bryan invites his readers to do the necessary mental spade work to begin crafting their own communities.

$review_text.: I have almost 100 different plant identification guides alone; some quite specialized (such as the ones I have on lichens, mycology, or marine algae), and others more general, and this is probably the best general guide organized by region that I have. I like it even better than the Audubon Society Pacific Coast guide, or their Forests, Western Region, Guide, which are also useful books, but as they cover both animals and plants, of course the coverage can't be as complete on the plants as this book is.The nature photography in these books just gets better over the years, and this book is no exception. The photos are truly excellent, and the identification notes in books like these have also improved substantially over the years. This book is no exception. I was formally trained in botany and plant taxonomy for a while, almost completing a master's degree in the subject once, and I feel I know a good plant guide when I see it, and this is a fine book.Unless you want to get into truly professional-level plant taxonomies, which would usually require separate books on trees, flowers, lichens, etc., not to mention the greater technical knowlege required, I think this is the best overall identification guide around. It can't cover everything, of course, but it covers the most important and most common species. Overall, this is a quality guide and a great book to take with you on trips, hikes, outings, or whatever.
$SUMMARY.: A superb guide

$review_text.: I really enjoyed this Valentines Day Story... It starts out with our Hero and Heroine being pretty much Anti-Valentine especially Amanda. I love the humor that is put in with her view of the holiday. I think that the story line and characters are great. I love that Adam calls Amanda, Angel. I also like that this was more of a sweet romance, the relationship was more of a front runner.The secondary characters of Jenny (Adam's younger sister) and his partner Jake are a nice addition and keep the book flowing. It is a fast read but I don't think anything felt lacking. I really enjoyed it and look forward to Jenny and Jake's story in &#34;A summer Love&#34; .

$review_text.: I'm used to being transported to another era when I read a novel by Christoph Fischer. Set in England, his latest offering, Time to Let Go, transports the reader, not through the years, but into the lives of one family dealing with the splintered effects of Alzheimers.I've lost several relatives and friends to this devastating disease. I'm familiar with the stages for the patient and the ramifications on the care givers. And so is Christoph Fischer in his portrayal of Biddy Korhonen and her family members dealing with her descent into Alzheimers.Mr. Fischer shows the various ways individuals deal with the illness. There's the husband Walter who depends upon the routine and regimen of a scheduled life to keep his wife from falling into a deeper stage. He can keep control of the situation to a certain extent, only as far as Biddy's mind will allow it. Nothing can bring her back to the loving wife she'd always been. When he can't control his wife's failings, he absorbs himself in creating a book of family memories. He can control what is remembered and how much is revealed about the individuals who make up the Finnish branch of the Korhonen family.Daughter Hanna uses the mother's illness as a chance to come home and hide out from the realities of her life as an airline stewardess when things go horribly wrong on her last flight. Her casual attitude toward schedules and regimens clashes with her father's grip on his life with Biddy. Hanna runs into problems with this casualness, yet there are times when Biddy seems so happy with the change.It's all here in this novel, and it's done in such a way that the reader is caught up in the lives of the Krohonen's and rooting for the family to finally communicate with one another before it's too late. I found myself agreeing with both sides in the debate on how to handle Biddy's situation. Since I've seen the terrific toll Alzhemiers takes, I understand the complicated feelings and situations that arise. Mr. Fischer handles it deftly and with sympathy for both Hanna and Walter and Biddy. No one is right, and no one is wrong.As he does with his historical novels set in the first half of the twentieth century in eastern Europe, Mr. Fischer manages to bring in the prejudices of a generation raised with biases toward people of different religions, races, and ideologies. It's not an indictment of older generations, but it is a reality best met with honesty and acceptance.Thank you, Christoph Fischer, for once again bringing us a work of fiction that asks us to examine our beliefs and open our minds to honest communication with those we love the most.Disclosure: I was given an advanced review copy in exchange for an honest review.

$review_text.: This novel has an exciting theme and a classic plot that has fallen out of use lately. It's rich with knowledge of the skills necessary to survive in a collapsed society, and offers some excellent information on wild edibles.The narrative is another thing all together. Ninety percent first person inner monologue, its very dry- and its perfectly voiced for the character it represents and her need to move past the loss of her father and to survive the unknown creatures shes surrounded with...But as a reader, its very dry and unemotional, almost pedantic in tone.I'd really like to give this story a higher score, a 3.5, but that's not possible, and it hasn't earned a four.Also, with respect to other works by the author discussed at the end of this story, I was unable to read the titles due to text color being to similar to the background color; also  what I could see of the cover models was appealing but hard to see because of the excessive shadowing. I'm not questioning the quality of the art and typography, but I will say the artist needs to be more aware of how the covers will look viewed on a mobile device. What looks fab at 8.5 x 11 is hard to see on the viewing area of an iPhone.

$REVIEW.: Having already read Rebekah Weatherspoon's "Better Off Red" (a vampire sorority girl story that was freaking hot and a refreshingly new take on vampires) I knew that I was in for some quality writing with "The Fling."It was there - from page one, Weatherspoon's erotic style is there in full force, and she wastes no time in getting you on board for the situation. The engaged Annie has a deal with her fiance Jeff - they're spending a month prior to the wedding as a kind of "one last hurrah" time apart. What happens in this month is intended to be just that - a last fling with their time apart. Jeff, Annie knows, is off in Europe with his buddies and probably sowing his last wild oats, and so Annie takes the opportunity to test that desire she's always had to sleep with a woman.The woman in question is Annie's personal trainer, and Oksana is incredibly different from Annie - Oksana is mixed race, tattooed and pierced, and slim and toned; Annie has always been short, is blonde-cute, and has definitely been blessed in the breast department. Annie approaches this fling as just that - a one night stand, meant to be enjoyed and remembered, and nothing more.Except Annie starts to realize that what she feels with Oksana is something bigger than she set out to enjoy.What I hadn't expected was to get so caught up in the sweetness of the two women - both come from histories that leave them hesitant and scarred in realistic ways, and I caught myself gobbling my way through the book to make sure that things would end well for everyone involved. Of course, when you're talking about a relationship that was supposed to be a fling before marriage, how can no one get hurt?Fun, sweet, and - of course - hot as heck, Rebekah Weatherspoon delivers again. It's almost enough to make me forgive her for not writing the fraternity boy side of her Vampire Sorority Sisters series.Almost.

Her husband would spend so much time on a murder while on his honeymoon and 2) That Maddie would call her friends from the mainland to come to Hawaii to help her with a crime.

$review_text.: Disney, and especially the Magic Kingdom, is one of the best models that can be used to take any company to the next level of customer satisfaction, according to Bill Connellan in this book

The book tells the fictional story of five different people who travel to Disney World for three days of learning how the Magic Kingdom goes about providing exceptional customer service.It is a good idea for a book; Disney does an excellent job of entertaining its customers and making sure that they have fun
There is a great deal that almost any business can learn from Disney; unfortunately, in my opinion most of what they can learn is not contained in this short book


The author was not authorised by Disney to write the book, and what he has written does not reflect Disney's own view of itself.The book tells you to pay attention to detail, walk the talk, and reward, recognize and celebrate, but it does not tell you how to tell a story, how to capture the imagination of your audience, how to create an experience so compelling that people want to return again and again, how to connect with customers on a deep emotional level, or how to have fantastic fun


 All that the book gives you is, in my opinion, seven simple principles which may be of some help to some companies but are really peripheral to the success of Disney.

$review_text.: Review for Ramblings From This Chick. ramblingsfromthischick.blogspot.comI will admit that I don't really know how to start this review. Chasing Desire by Jennifer Domenico left me with mixed feelings and I am a bit confused after just having finished reading it. This book was a lot different than I had expected, and I am not really sure what I am feeling right now. I think that this story started off good, and there was a lot of promise initially. But as the story progressed, things got muddled and turned into a mess for me. There was a lot going on, and yet it was really repetitive especially when it came to the dialogue. This one started off as being one I was really enjoying, but by the end of the story had lost my interest completely.Braden James is the ultimate manwhore. He sleeps around, wants no commitment and has no problems with his life the way it is. But when he gets a promotion at his job and he starts to have women troubles as well as a bad dream, he decides to clean up his act a little bit. When Mackenzie contacts him about coming to work for his company, he is immediately drawn to her. He wants her and she wants him. But she is pretty much the female version of him and doesn't like to get involved with coworkers. Mackenzie and Braden find it difficult to fight what is between them and as much as they try to avoid each other, they eventually give in to their feelings. But can they make things work with their careers and their feelings for one another? And what happens when a threat they never realized was there arises and puts them in danger?I really didn't like Brayden at first. He was cocky and arrogant, and a total user when it came to women. I like a reformed player as well as the next girl, but Brayden just rubbed me wrong right from the start. I did start to warm up to him though, and when he started to realize his actions and reputation were affecting his career I really did believe that he wanted to change. He started to become this great guy, and he was really sweet with Mackenzie. I believed in his transformation, and I could see that although he struggled with feeling love for the first time that he really cared about her and wanted things to work. Mackenzie was also a bit hard to warm up to. She had some issues and struggled with them which made her not be able to trust easily. She was having a tough time with her feelings for Brayden and didn't know how be in love with him either. I did like that she was able to eventually open up to him, but I think it took too long for her to get there and there was a lot of unnecessary conflict because of that. I think that Brayden and Mackenzie had a ton of chemistry together, and that is the one area that they never had problems with. They were really hot together from the start.What really started to make me lose interest in this story is that we already had a ton of drama with Brayden's womanizing ways and the women who he left behind. But then things get truly bizarre when the contemporary romance turns into a suspense because a stalker randomly appears. Next thing we know there is someone stalking Brayden and Mackenzie, sending texts and making problems in their relationship, taking pictures of them together and sending them out and then a kidnapping. If this had been eased into from the beginning it wouldn't have been so much of an issue, but this doesn't even start until well into the book. Throw in an overzealous young virgin friend of Brayden's sister who won't take no for an answer and a bitchy coworker who is all bark and no bite, and this one just got weird. This book was pretty cheesy and had a lot of cliches and just didn't work for me. As good as this one might have started, it just steadily declined after the initial meeting of the hero and heroine. I kept reading thinking that it would get better only to realize that it was just the same thing with nothing to make it stand out or hold it's own. I wanted to like this one, but the repetitive dialogue and weird antics just made this one a miss for me. I think if readers go into this one expecting a suspense that it would help a lot, but from the blurb there is no indication of that at all which just makes it seem to come completely out of the blue. If you are a fan of suspense and like your romance on the cheesy side, you might give this one a shot.**Complimentary Copy Provided by Good Choice Reading**

$REVIEW.: I can't say enough good things about this book!! There is such great chemistry right from the start between Jenna and Max. Max is the perfect combination of sexy, confident and romantic without being abusive or a jerk. The story moves so fast and is exciting to see how they come together. Jenna is so likeable, I want to hang out with her. I can't wait to read it again and again!!!

$review_text.: The Terran Gambit is the first entry into Enti Webb's The Pax Humana cycle. It's wasn't that surprising, at least to me, that The Terran Gambit is about the end of the Pax Humana. Global, or galactic, peace is hard to make interesting. Humans have spread far beyond Earth, and have created a vast state, called The Corsican Empire, which is styled upon the Roman Empire. At the edges of the Empire there are small pirate groups or unaligned planets, but the vast majority of the empire lives without war, leaving humanity in a state of peace, or a Pax Humana.The book opens with the citizens of the Earth rebelling, though their reasons for revolt are not clear. This lack of real motivation was a problem for me throughout the book. There are some passages where it's mentioned that the bureaucracy is overwhelming, and basic support services are hard to come by, but nothing that convinced me that rebellion was necessary. This rebellion is quickly crushed, though one Resistance battleship escapes. At this point the story jumps forwards three years, after the resistance has been crushed and reintegrated with the rest of the empire.Here we join our heroes, three hotshots who distinguished themselves while fighting for the resistance and one latecomer, as they report to a newly forming fleet. This fleet features the newest, biggest, and baddest ships the Empire has to offer, and the majority of the crew is former Resistance members. Obviously we all see where this is going. In between the action Webb uses his heroes to showcase a bit of what&#8217;s going on down on Earth that compels everyone to rebel. As I mentioned before, he didn&#8217;t sell me on it. Hopefully in future editions he delves more into the Resistance&#8217;s background.Along the way we meet the enemy, an Empire Admiral by the name of Trajan. It&#8217;s quite clear that he&#8217;s modeled off of Imperial Grand Admiral Thrawn from The Thrawn Trilogy. Instead of art Trajan analyzes people using their taste in music, and despite lacking the red alien eyes has his face disfigured from a lost eye. Now, before anyone starts making assumptions, I&#8217;m not saying this is a bad thing. Thrawn is one of my favorite villains, and it&#8217;s nice to see another take on his character. So far Trajan hasn&#8217;t been developed much, but I get the sense that Webb is setting him up for some big events in future installments.Overall I thoroughly enjoyed The Terran Gambit. The action was tight, and the combat exciting. One thing that did strike me as an issue was some of the descriptions of women, I personally think that the phrase &#8220;tight little ass&#8221; should only be uttered by a character, not used as a descriptive phrase. Still, the story grabbed my attention, and the characters were likeable. I&#8217;ll be reading the sequel (supposed to come out this month - May 2014) as soon as I can.Per G Jonsson on PG&#8217;s Ramblings liked the book, and had a few interesting comments. One that struck me was that he found some of the action to be unrealistic. I have to agree, but I will give The Terran Gambit the benefit of the doubt; I put it in the category of sci-fi totally opposite of &#8220;hard sci-fi,&#8221; whatever that may be. It never tries to be hard, and so shouldn&#8217;t, in my opinion, be held to that standard. Another comment he made was that the book mostly is setting up the later series. This I wholeheartedly agree with, but again, don&#8217;t hold it against the book. We&#8217;ve all got to start somewhere. I think we have to see how the sequels are handled to determine if this was the right move or not.

Of course you don't have to have all of these traits, but the author goes into details about what they feel are the most important aspects of being powerful and then explains what you need to do in order to develop them yourself. There's also a pretty cool bonus chapter which I enjoyed.All in all, a great book with some powerful messages in it.

$review_text.: First, I would like to say I love romance novels, having read 800 of them in the past 2 years on my kindle. I love contemporary, suspense, historical and erotic romances but I do not like paranormal/shapeshifter/vampire romances so I was pleasantly surprised at how much I loved this novel. Originally, I read it because I've known the author for years, as I taught in the same department in a high school as her husband. I didn't expect to be drawn into the plot so readily and to fall in love with the hero and heroine so easily. The writing is inspired, intelligent and meant for an educated audience but all of the other romance elements are there also, a to-die-for hero, a sympathetic heroine and an evil half-brother all combine to give the reader an unforgettable experience. And I LOVED the ending, one of my favorites ever. Please give this great novel a chance. I plan on reading everything in the future this author writes.

$review_text.: Diabetes runs on both sides of my family. My father has been a type two diabetic for nearly all my life. When my Doctor told me my eating choices were leading me down a similar path, I knew a big change was needed. He recommended a diet plan to lower my blood glucose level as I had started to develop hyperglycemia. This book was a Godsend. The basic concept of the Glycemic Index Diet is a set of guidelines helping me to choose foods that are low on the glycemic index score. By doing things such as counting carbs (which unlike other diets are encouraged in moderation) and managing my portion control I was losing weight and lowering my blood glucose levels. This book is directed at those who need to lose weight to prevent health issues.

$REVIEW.: I&#8217;ve made my living writing Key West/Caribbean novels for the last decade, so I&#8217;m fairly sure I know what works for authors and readers. &#8220;Peavey&#8217;s Paradise&#8221; has the right taste and feel for South Florida, and the characters are real and gritty. It&#8217;s not exotic writing, but it keeps your nose in the book and keeps you turning pages, while stroking you with humor here and there &#8211; and that&#8217;s what every reader wants. Author G.D. Young sweeps you up from the very first page with a bona fide sense of authority and carries you to well-paced, satisfying conclusion.

$review_text.: I've now read the whole series, and I've having real trouble writing this review. Mr. Bell is a very good writer. He understands the language, he's good at developing his characters, who come alive in these stories, and his plots don't strain credulity. His courtroom scenes are some of the very best I've read in potboilers like these, and I've read an awful lot of them since I love good courtroom drama. My problem is with Mr. Bell's over-emphasis on the prime character's Christian fundamentalism. I'm a Christian too, and a serious one. But Kit Shannon tends to come off as a fanatic. It's one thing to show how Christianity supports her in her often difficult job, but it's another to turn her into sort of a door-to-door, have you heard the good news proselytizer. The way Mr. Bell paints her, Kit tends to come off as a person with a shrunken sense of humor, a trait necessary for someone to be truly effective at showing others the way. But Kit's flaw doesn't change the fact that this whole series is very well done and a very enjoyable read.

$REVIEW.: Dr

Seung Heun Lee wrote Healing Society:  A Prescription for Global Enlightenment because he wanted &quot;to call upon the world to embark on an Enlightenment Revolution&quot; and &quot;to let everyone know of their own right to enlightenment.&quot;  Dr


Lee has written sixteen previous books and lectures extensively
 He also founded &quot;Dahn Hak Movement,&quot; which is designed to help in spiritual awakening, and helped establish the New Millennium Peace Foundation with Neale Donald Walsch

 The United Nations has recognized Dr

Lee as a preeminent spiritual leader of the world.He emphasizes throughout the book that enlightenment is not just for a select few, but available to everyone

 He defines enlightenment as &quot;a simple choice that you make to live your life for the betterment and benefit of all those around you.&quot;  One needs only to make that choice, and then develop the discipline to live out that choice.Part of becoming enlightened involves training your life energy, or Ki

 Dr


Lee explains exactly how to do this


 He has also developed a technique called &quot;Brain Respiration&quot; as a &quot;realistic and everyday form of spiritual training&quot; for all those people who don't have the time or inclination to go live on a mountain top or join a  monastery.Once people achieve personal enlightenment, the next step is global enlightenment


 Dr


Lee says that we once all lived together as enlightened beings in harmony, and that we have deep spiritual longings to regain this world


 In order to do that, &quot;we need to recover the sense of Oneness and harmony that we have lost.&quot;  That requires making both a personal and a collective choice to be enlightened


 He wants at least one hundred million people to be spiritually enlightened by the end of this decade


 &quot;The healing vibration of their choices and determination will cure the Earth of the ills we have caused,&quot; he says.Most people have forgotten that we are all part of One
 Forgetting that has led to the state of affairs that exists today

 If you'd like to meet your Creator Within and become a part of the solution rather than continue as part of the problem, then I highly recommend reading Healing Society.

$review_text.: There isn't much of a lead-up or introduction to the premise of the story.The reader kind of gets thrown in there at the deep end

One minute the main character is apparently a sweet tasting delectable morsel that is on the demons most wanted list and the next she has is toting her own set of fangs.Not sure the fight scene with Michael was believeable

She is a newly turned vamp with a 'light' heritage and yet she is supposedly more powerful than an ancient angel?Other than the constantly changing narration in the form of more than one first person POV, which was at times a little distracting, the story was pleasant


Unfortunately pleasant to the point of being rather bland.I think given a little more character development and depth the story could have been a lot stronger.I received a copy of this book via NetGalley.

The story need to be fleshed out more and I wouldnt really called this a novella - more of a short story. It could have been so good had the author taken the time to really think about where to take this story and how to go about it. Sadly, its just a great big disappointment.UPDATE: 03/26/13 I re downloaded since a new revised version was made and its way better. Still a rushed ending but a lot more satisfying than I remembered.

'ineffable' with one of the best opening lines I've ever read."I was sitting on the toilet when he told me he wanted a divorce."See? Brilliant first line

I think that quote pretty much sets you up for the book


It's a fab, fun read about a woman, Roxie, 'recreating' herself after her husband asks for a divorce.Roxie has the best of best friends, Hope, who creates her The Good Wife Life List


Filled with 27 'things' that Roxie must fulfill in her summer in order to reawaken the old her, the pre marriage her, the FUN her

There were some absolutely brilliant suggestions on this list, especially the last one (why wasn't that in the book?) Everybody should have a Hope in their life.Roxie spends that first summer as a single lady back in her home town living with her brother and his best friend, Jake

You know this is where the story really starts
Adam and Roxie share a past.

'The Summer of Jake and Roxie' was a particularly hot past of theirs


We learn about this by going in back time in a flawless transition.Anyway.
I loved this read
It did take me DAYS to read but that's because I was busy, I could have easily read this in one go if I had the time

It was hot, sweet, funny

A really fun time


I love an easy book for in beteeen my heavier ones and this is perfect for that.The Good Life was a great debut for Jodie Beau


The writing kept interested and entertained and the story, whilst not unique, was still enjoyable all the same


The only thing I was disappointed in was the ending

The epilogue in particular just seemed so abrupt and a little unrealistic


It certainly leaves you with the feeling that there could possibly be a sequel.

$review_text.: Ashley Fontaine has created a powerfully intense murder thriller

This is the first book I have read by this author and I was stunned as the further I got into it and how it escalated into thrilling action


 This story is a startling revelation, you might say, of cause and effect
It highlights the characters as the author takes you into their minds to reveal their thoughts
These thoughts and actions involve those who work at Winscott Law Firm and how one death accelerates into many vindictive thoughts and evil actions of most of the characters

 It definitely reflects how people's lives become out of balance with thoughts of revenge


 It also proves that one really never knows another person

 Reading this novel is like playing "I Spy" into these compelling, complex characters


 This author has awesome creativity


 This will not be the last Ashley Fontaine story that I will read.

$REVIEW.: There is no shortage of books on the Holocaust. We have, of course, the diary of Anne Frank, which appears to be the definitive nonfiction work recording World War II. It always seems more difficult, though, to find out what the war was like in France, as most accounts by or about Jews seem to focus on eastern Europe.H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Berr was a French university student at the time of the war. A violin player and student of English literature, she wrote a journal that by any account would be considered an accomplishment in style, literary analysis and flow. Her prose is beautiful, and you almost forget that you are reading about the Holocaust, as it is just as interesting to read her thoughts on music and literature.Again, a comparison with Anne Frank seems the best way to illustrate Berr's own journal. Frank lived in the Secret Annex and had nothing else to do but write for long hours in her diary. Once she heard that diaries were going to be collected after the war, she even went back and began to edit it with the intent of publication. It was written because she was a regular girl who kept a journal whenever she had the free time. Not everyone knows what it feels like to live in Nazi-occupied Paris, but more of us do know what it feels like to be in love with two people at once or to be frustrated with your family, friends or schoolwork. In that basic humanity, we can insert ourselves immediately into Berr's world, and then we follow her into the darker times, as the Gestapo gain more and more control over it.Berr's family struggles to hold on when her father is taken to a prison. The man she loves is forced to flee France for his safety, and she watches as friends and neighbors are taken by the Gestapo to various prisons and camps. She herself seems lucky enough, but even her education and life are deeply affected by the presence of Hitler's police in her city.I struggle in my own reading of Holocaust literature because I don't want to seem morbid or as if I enjoy descriptions of death and inhumane treatment. Anyone who has read a book or seen a movie probably has had to take in more than enough descriptions of Nazi treatment of Jews and others. But we continue to read so that we don't forget, and because each account gives us a little something different. THE JOURNAL OF HELENE BERR seems more hopeful, partly because of its unique narrator. Berr, who was Jewish, was able to go on with her daily life for much longer than others, and because of that, we see a more realistic, young girl reaction to the ways her life was changed. How horrible it is to wear an ugly yellow star on all of your fashionable clothing. How terrible it is when you can't be mean to your mother, because she is the one who is keeping the family together while your father is in prison. Berr's thoughts seem more within reach than others, if just because it is easier not to have to fathom so many horrific experiences at death and concentration camps.THE JOURNAL OF HELENE BERR is illustrated further with a glossary, an epilogue detailing Berr's death in Bergen-Belsen just days before its liberation, an index and more. It would be an illuminating addition to any personal library or school curriculum.--- Reviewed by Sarah Hannah G&oacute;mez

$review_text.: Pretty much everyone has heard of The Hunger Games, and most have their own opinions about the series. What we rarely get to see, is an author share their thoughts about a book or series. The Girl Who Was On Fire gives us that chance. Each author focuses on a certain topic, or issue, in the book and they explain their thoughts on the trilogy.I had several sections of this book that stood out as favorites. Each author brought humor and fascinating theories to support their outlook. Sarah Rees Brennan had some very funny comments regarding the love and sexy-times in the series. She admits she's "a filthy-minded creature from the gutter". It's so nice to see authors open up and show that they are just like us! *wink*Cara Lockwood focused on the science behind some of the creatures we see in The Hunger Games; tracker jackers, and mutts. I was shocked to read about some of the scientific experiments that have been conducted by researchers, in real life. Scary stuff! It proved that maybe tracker jackers may not be far from our future.For me, I really loved how each section brought back memories from reading the book. It gave me a lot to think about and pointed out things I had missed along the way. As readers, we often focus on different things we notice in the book but The Girl Who Was On Fire lets us have time to slow down and concentrate on each individual issue.Other stories discuss the fashion, politics, media, and of course, the relationships we all come to enjoy during the trilogy. If you enjoyed The Hunger Games series, and would like to see how authors feel about the story, you gotta read this book. Each story is interesting in its own way and helps the reader look back at these books that have been embraced so much by teens and adults.
$SUMMARY.: Perfect for Hunger Games fans!

$review_text.: I found this book excellent reading.  The characters were well fleshed out and believable, the plot was interesting and the pace was breathtakingly fast.  The author kept my interest easily and fully through the time it took me to read the "book" which was less than half an hour.I tend to mention the length of time it takes to read ebooks in reviews, because the storytelling and time you spend engrossed in the read are what you're being asked to pay for.I loved this book, but at this length I won't consider the next books in the series at $2.99 each. To be honest, as short as this was I'd be disinclined to purchase them at a dollar each.I have to agree with the reviewer that stated this book was a chapter, not a book and I'm sorry to do so because it really was a good read.ADDENDUM: I wrote this review prior to reading the second ebook the single download provided, "Children of Time: Book 1" which was about twice the length of The Child of Mystery and an equally good read.  This author is a remarkable story teller, boo bad her stories are so short.

$REVIEW.: This book is an interesting contrast between the problems and the potential of the self publishing market.  The author has some real skill, he deals well with characters, description, and dialogue.  He managed to avoid many of the pitfalls common to first novels, his protagonist is believable, the interplay between characters is used to illustrate the world (rather than long bouts of exposition), and so on.  This is a writer who could get his second or third novel published by a major publisher.  Even as a first novel, this one might have been published by a big house if it had some attention from an experienced editor.The problems an editor could have helped fix:  The initial character introduction was one dimensional.  The first half of the novel is almost entirely inside the head of the protagonist.  Minimal interaction between him and the outside world.  The use of first person requires more use of character interaction to keep things rolling.  There are maybe two pages of interaction, total, between the main character and his high school friends and enemies.  The middle of the book was an attempt at the Jim Butcher "big middle(tm)", it seemed contrived just for that purpose, with the actual bad guys only introduced at that point.  The secondary characters introduced after the "big middle(tm)" are too one dimensional.  These are the college room mates, and you feel like they are ghosts in the background. Also, trying to do regional accents (like an Irish Brogue...) bad idea unless you have some real experience living and speaking in the area you are trying to emulate.The end-  The last twenty pages (or so) of this book are the biggest problem.  They destroy the ability to suspend disbelief.  No government agency is going to recruit untrained college students for a James Bond mission to be carried out in a month.  I wanted to throw my kindle down and stomp on it.In total, the book is not bad (except for the end).  My advice is this-  Buy it anyway.  Maybe the author will overcome some of the obvious problems with practice.  He certainly has some potential and maybe your $3 will help him improve his skills.

$REVIEW.: I have certainly become a fan of the Grabchuk Family's work. I normally like my puzzles in videogame format, so having an ebook like this is quite appealing to me. I initially found the Puzzle Quizzes series a bit difficult to get into, but now I really enjoy the challenge. There are times I get a bit frustrated, but it's nice to have a way to work out my brain :-)I'm still amazed at how they keep thinking up these awesome puzzles, and I really liked the visual style of puzzles in this volume. The instructions are nice and clear. I found them intuitive and easy to get into. I found this to be a great de-stresser after a long day of work.I found that this to maintain a consistent level of difficulty (some of their other books get a bit tough). Don't get discouraged if you mess up a few. You'll also find new material here - even if you've completed their other books, this won't be a cakewalk.If you've enjoyed other Grabachuk books, then you likely already have this. At this price, you really have no excuse to not give it a try. While this version is meant for an e-ink device, I highly recommend the HD version if you have a supported device. I really enjoyed the full colour puzzles and instructions on the HD version, but this is a great option on the go (I ended up buying both).Rodolfo

$REVIEW.: I had no idea who this Stephen Carpenter guy was until I'd finished the book (thought it might be Stephen King noodling around with indie publishing for a time)
Should have known it was someone from the kingdom of storytelling - television
Bam! -- it starts with a central question and is paced with near perfection as the author weaves in and out through voice, pacing, POV, character development, and the right twist at the right time

It was gory at times, but I didn't even realize it until I'd gotten off the rollercoaster of this book
The research never rides on the surface and is always in service of the story
And what a story

An homage to the hard-boiled detectives of the Golden Era is here (man, he reflects the inner workings of character through manipulation of language so well!), a nod to horror stories (be still my restless heart), yet was always deliciously contemporary

I couldn't put it down, and I'd highly recommend it to ANYBODY who appreciates a wicked good mind working on the wicked good mine of a reader.Mr
Carpenter, you owe me a night of sleep stolen
Reader, wear a seat belt.

$REVIEW.: WOW!  This book was not what I expected!  I think I was expecting a kind of road trip romance and ended up with an almost epic romance.  So much happened in this book, I don't even know where to begin my review!Ian and Sarah were great characters - but they both had flaws. Ian had a habit of speaking without thinking first and he really doesn't understand women. And Sarah would hear his words and make sweeping assumptions without ever asking him for clarification, she is also a bit selfish and immature.  Sarah also runs away from her problems. If there was one thing in this book I didn't like - that would be it.So we have a book filled with adventure, lust, misunderstandings, resentment, tragedy, heart wrenching sorrow, secrets, steamy loving scenes, forgiveness, compromise, family and finally understanding and true love.This book isn't just a story, it is an reading adventure ride!  You are up and down, your heart stops and then it is racing.  You begin to wonder if this is going to work for Ian and Sarah. And when it does you almost sigh in relief.  Because no matter the misunderstandings and tragic events, you know these two are meant to be.I enjoyed this book. It was well written and drew me in emotionally, and kept me hooked to the very end. I would recommend this book to anyone who reads historical romance.  And while it could easily stand alone, you are missing out if you don't read the first two books in the Caversham series!Now the waiting for Lucky's Lady begins :)

$REVIEW.: This well organized and informative book covers 160 houseplants. Arranged in 3 sections - "Blooming houseplants", "Foliage houseplants" and 'Houseplant Care," the tops of the pages are color-coded for fast access. Plants are listed by their botanical name but you can look up their common names in the index or a Botanical/Common Name Cross Reference chart in the back of the book. Almost all plants are given a 2 page spread which includes a description, a chart with specifications indicating light levels, temperature, fertilizer, water and soil needs, repotting advice, longevity, propagation techniques, selection and display tips. A troubleshooting guide provides characteristics of what to look for if a plant is in trouble and what you should do about it. Plants with various varities, like bromeliads, bulbs, cacti, orchids, ferns and palms are covered in  more expanded sections. The color photos (included for each plant) are outstanding. The final chapter, "Houseplant Care," covers aspects such as containers, fertilizers, insect pests, propagation, plant characteristics and identification tips, terrariums and watering techniques. The semi-hard cover and flexible binding make the book easy to flip through and the attractive lay-out and page colorings make this book a joy to use. A must-have reference for serious houseplant growers!

$review_text.: Usually before I start a book, I like to read the synopsis on the book jacket or on the internet in the case of an e-book.  I like to get a feel for the story before I dive in.  In the case of Beloved Destiny by Carol Ann Fears, I was excited because it seemed like it was going to be right up my alley - historical fiction with a little romance thrown in.  The story revolves around 17 year old Carina Blanchett and her family who live on a plantation near Natchez, Mississippi in the early 19th century.  Carina was born to a privileged life, and her family expects her to marry someone of her own station even though she is in love with someone else, but we soon learn that wealth and class does not necessarily make a gentleman and that a person's qualities should matter far more than money and background.  Will Carina learn to love or will love eventually find its way back to her?I really wanted to like this book; however, although Fears definitely has a talent for the written word, there were just too many areas where this book fell short in my eyes.  Don't get me wrong - this book was not boring or poorly written by any means, but there was just no magic to the story.In a nutshell, there were two words that came to mind as I read this book:  predictable and formulaic.  I don't mind the traditional boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, boy can't have girl, but eventually boy gets girl plot, but I like stories that are not quite so predictable and where there are interesting side plots that really flesh out the story.  If the story had been longer, Fears could have delved much deeper into the fascinating history of the pre-Civil War era of the South.  What she does describe is well done, but I yearned for so much more.  For example, I was very excited to hear mention of the Underground Railroad when I read the synopsis for this book, and I looked forward to some excitement in the plot as a result.  However, there were only three brief references to one slave's involvement in hiding runaways on their way north, and nothing ever developed from that.I was also disappointed in the main character, Carina.  When introduced to her at the beginning of the story, the reader is led to believe that she is not like other southern belles of that era, in that she is intelligent, strong-willed and independent.  I thought she was going to be a character to admire - one who would break the mold.  However, the next thing you know, she is fainting and swooning into a man's arms in the garden because the sun is hot and she forgot her bonnet.  When faced with arranged marriage, I was waiting for her to step up to the plate and tell her family that she wouldn't have anything to do with it, but again she wilted in the heat.  And to allow the deception of a happy marriage to continue even after being threatened by her less than loving husband does not make a strong character to be admired in my books.  Carina could have been a formidable protagonist who would have given the story some depth and who could have stood for the beginning of women fighting for their rights, but she was not all that much different than the other southern belles.  All in all, I liked the characters because each one was different and interesting in his or her own way, but I am sure that if this story was longer and more detailed and complex, I would have loved the characters.If you want a really light read with a good old fashioned romance, you may want to give Beloved Destiny a try, but if you want something with a little more substance, this is not the book for you.Carol Ann Fears grew up in Kentucky, where she majored in English at Murray State University.  Before finishing her education, Carol took some time off to get married, and after four children, a nursing degree and a move to Kenosha, WI she now lives again in western Kentucky with her husband, Perry, and their two Jack Russell terriers and four cats.  After retiring from nursing in 2007, she decided to return to her love of writing and completed Beloved Destiny in four months.  She is currently working on a second novel set in 14th century England.  Reviewer:  Cindy Taylor, Allbooks Review International

$review_text.: I've been to Japan several times on business.  I picked up Little Adventures in Tokyo for my second trip, and it was a fun read and great inspiration to get out and try new and different things.  I recommend not to use it for a first trip because Japan can be so overwhelming and exciting that one does not need additional inspiration.  Or, if it's a first trip, limit yourself to the simplest activities in the book, such as the department store opening and picnic.  However, beyond that initial exposure, it is very encouraging and suggests such a variety of activities that everyone is bound to find something of interest.There are a few caveats.  First, as some other reviewers note, some of the adventures require Japanese.  In particular, I suggest that you do NOT call the Shiatsu master unless you speak Japanese.  He is a true professional, not a tourist attraction.  I called him but quickly realized that he had limited English (and I have only very elementary Japanese).  For expats who may live in Tokyo and wish to have extended treatment, go ahead.  For tourists, give him a break!  Instead, ask your hotel concierge for a referral.Second, yes, some of the adventures are out of date.  Tokyo is such a dynamic city that this is likely to happen to you several times.  Restaurants and shops are continually moving around, at similar to any large US city but at 3-5 times the pace.  Even online guides such as Tokyo Food Page that should be up to date often fall behind.  One time I went to a very highly rated restaurant from an online guide, only to find that the whole building was fenced off and scheduled for demolition.In short, the book is one of the most enjoyable and interesting guides to Tokyo -- but the "guide" part of it must be viewed cautiously.  Read it and have fun!

$review_text.: I am a vegetarian and I wasn't sure what to expect from the Paleo diet. I know it's very popular but I doubted I would like the recipes when I discovered that some of my favorite foods are not allowed: corn, potatoes, grains and legumes.But not to worry because there are some great recipes in this book. For instance, I love zucchini bread and the first recipe in the book is for zucchini pancakes which I am certain to love. A lot of these recipes call for nut flours, since grains are not allowed. Nuts will make these pancakes taste richer than 'regular' pancakes made with wheat and other grain flours.The cauliflower cream soup is very similar to one I make often so I know it's delicious. The only difference is that I usually add a bit of spicy mustard to my cauliflower soup.The raisin vinaigrette is included in the dessert section but it sounds as though it would be great on those zucchini pancakes I'm looking forward to eating. The combination of sweet raisins with the spiciness of the other ingredients is unusual and if you are a raisin lover, this is a recipe to try.And then we come to my favorite of the recipes: coconut ice! This is an alternative to ice cream and if you like coconut, you will love this recipe! This is certain to be a favorite treat when the weather is warm once again.

$REVIEW.: From time to time, I come across a work of fiction that is so obviously written by someone who has experience with the subject matter as to make it come alive.  The Beloved Daughter is one such book.Most of what I know of the conditions in North Korea in general, and for believers specifically, is in small bits and pieces from various missionary organizations.  I've never doubted what they described, though it's hard to grasp how inhumane humans can be to one another when you only read a paragraph here and there.  Likewise with how irrational people can be simply because of the name of Jesus.Alana Terry has written a masterpiece that puts life in perspective in North Korea.  That takes me out of the safety of my US life and transports me into the prisons where my brothers and sisters in Christ survive, somehow - or not.  It also puts &#34;free&#34; life for Christians in North Korea in perspective.  The constant observation of surroundings and suspicious people, the need for places to hide even in the home, to distrust even those people closest to you.Because of Alana Terry's book, The Beloved Daughter, I will no longer be so blase when I hear of prisoners in NK, or of torture of one of my brothers or sisters there.  I've &#34;seen&#34; the conditions in those prisons.  I don't know how they survive at all.  Prayer will be more than a simple &#34;Bless them&#34; from this time on.  Thank you, Alana, for painting this picture for me and for all who will read and let it affect them so profoundly.

$review_text.: Andrii Sedniev has filled this sharp book with powerful creativity principles and ways to use the subconscious mind as a tool for creating strategies and to generate ideas. It&#8217;s about developing the creative muscle using simple principles for creating new ideas for your business. There are numerous exercises to facilitate this and how to think differently than competitors.This intelligent book explains the science of effective brainstorming and describes how to let the subconscious mind know what it is that you want and need so that it can generate unlimited, amazing, creative ideas to help you with your business. Brainstorming is simply placing your attention on a problem so that your creative mind can do the rest. I learned that often the reason we can&#8217;t come up with a successful business idea is because we are asking the wrong question and that by changing or even just altering the question a little bit, the subconscious mind will be able to generate a variety of ideas.The author describes how to let the subconscious mind know what it is that you want and need so that it can generate unlimited, amazing, creative ideas to help you. In other words, this book explains the science of effective brainstorming, or placing your attention on a problem so that your creative mind can do the rest.The author states, &#8216;The only way to make the brain think hard and produce world-class ideas is to make it generate a lot of ideas.&#8217; He explains how important it is in creating new ideas to learn how to generate tons of them to choose from. This can be done, for example (one of many), by modifying old ideas that have been used before by actively, continuously seeking new experiences to draw from.Author Sedniev reminds the reader that more creativity and many more creative ideas come to lighthearted, not serious people. This book provides thinking techniques that really work for getting your subconscious to generate ideas for you and to develop the &#8220;creativity habit.&#8221; I was inspired by the stories of innovators who failed repeatedly before becoming successful and by the suggestions for creative thinking practices that significantly increase the number of creative thoughts as well as their quality.I was especially inspired by the concept of creating thousands of questions about how to carry out every task involved with my business (I teach fine art). Also, that if I can&#8217;t find a solution for one of these tasks, I&#8217;m truly not asking the right question and should alter or change it. By doing this, I can even change the quality and quantity of the successful ideas I come up with by putting my subconscious mind to work. Obviously, I have to take action to get more business and by trying this particular technique, I have already come up with some great ideas for promoting  my own business (I teach fine art) that I hadn&#8217;t considered before. Using some of the steps delineated in this book, I split some of the problems I&#8217;ve been having in this area (promoting myself) into smaller problems by asking questions. Then I split all the tasks I came up with into specific things to do. I also learned that switching between problems gives the subconscious lots of fodder to enhance its idea production. Now I have an actual plan that I&#8217;m following and it was so simple to create!Naturally, since this system worked for my business, I am going to start using it to solve everyday problems as well. The genius of this book is the simple-to-understand instructions for putting the subconscious mind to work to obtain results that can be used. This easy-to-follow book is an essential handbook for idea creativity. I don&#8217;t just recommend it for people who are entrepreneurs, but also for creative artists and writers.

$review_text.: As a kid I read many R.L. Stine books--from Goosebumps to Fear Street--so I expected Three Faces of Me to have a scary element to it; instead it is funny/silly.  The writing was more simplistic than I remembered, but I also haven't read a Goosebumps book in about 20 years.  What I had the most trouble with is that there didn't seem to be any larger purpose to the story which always seemed to be part of Stine's other books.  In Three Faces of Me, Ira discovers that there are some issues with his clones, but (spoiler) at the end he's once again trying to use a clone to his advantage.  The premise was interesting, but I wish Stine had pushed it a little further.

$review_text.: Plays Well With Others is Book Two in the Daly Way seriesPaisley Szuzman decided she's had enough of New York city life and wants to live and work in a more rural setting

So when she notices an ad for an administrative position at the Laurel Ridge Ranch, she jumps at the chance
All too quickly, however, she realizes that Daly, Wyoming is overflowing with men and not enough women
To the point that many of the men share one woman
In Paisley's situation, all four sexy cowboys on the ranch want her for their own


At first she's upset that these men didn't share this information with her at the interview

Soon, however, she's warmed to the idea and can't wait see what her four virile men have planned for her.I've come to believe that author Brynn Paulin is queen of multi-amory love
I've recently been educated by a sociologist and linguist that the correct term, using proper language bases, is either polyphilia or multi-amory, not poly-amory as it's commonly called

Whatever the tern, Ms

Paulin knows her stuff
Paisley is a heroine with gumption

A little bit of sass, a little bit of savvy and a lot of generosity has these four men eating out of the palm of her hand.All four men were unbelievably masculine specimens of sexuality, but I do believe it was Ace that captured my heart most thoroughly
All Alpha, all cowboy, he took charge of almost every situation, and was thoroughly up to any task

His intensity sent shivers down my spine


 I can't say much more about the story because of the potential of giving away a key part of the story, but I will say that it's a wonderful story, the second in the Daly Way series, after Belonging to Them
A fabulous read, and I can't wait to read about the Daly journeys of Paisley's sisters, Moonbeam and River.Courtesy of Fallen Angel Reviews

$REVIEW.: These books are well written, suspenseful, and most important, have interesting characters that I care about. I am eagerly awaiting the next installment. Ben Hopkin is definitely an author I will be following. Be aware the stories are not for the faint of heart, but if you want to get to know some well-developed, original characters and follow an exciting plot line, give these a try. Even the editing is better than average.

$REVIEW.: If you ever saw the movie from the late 90s The Cube this will be very familiar to you. Similar concept, geared towards a younger crowd.There isn't much to add to what the previous reviewers have written, just my personal thoughts. I was really drawn into the story.  I tend to get immersed into a good story and visualize all of it, and this was no exception. I'm quite impressed.  And the ending was wonderful, I thought.Fantastic. Definitely recommended.

$review_text.: I will admit, the beginning of this book truly shocked me.  Right off the bat Mr. Drake claims Isabeau.  It was truly crazy but that is why this is in a romance novel ;)  This book and the rest of this series are definitely worth the read.  If you love The Beautiful series, Fifty Shades of Grey and Submissive trilogies, then you will love The Billionaire's Beck and Call series too.

$REVIEW.: This hits my heart! I highly-recommend this to anyone who makes fun or degrades the transgenders as well as LGB & T goups. I went through all of this as a kid and had to 'endure-being-a-boy' until' I saw at age 14 this Dr. Renee Richards turn from a male to a female & I instantly-knew I was a GIRL!But the pressures of my dad catching-me wearing my mom's old nylons though my mom found panties I used to go to a thrift store dumpster to find girls closes & finally go inside and was in heaven with all the dresses to purchase but took forever to get to the register & lied...'its for my sister.' Today, I still live in a male body but Identify-myself as a Girl~  Parents, more than 1% of the population is transgendered & if your child has those questions, respect-it & have them see a gender-id clinic. You may have saved that person a life of pain or suicide which I came close to.This book is very-Very Real of what goes on in a Transgender person...very confusing when your family & society doesn't accept us!!  Thank you to this author for a Wonderful Story! Keep writing other great stories~A Sincere Thank-you Thank~You with my Heart!

$REVIEW.: I liked the story overall, but I have some issues
 Jordan, who is about to be 16, is treated like he's 10

A 16 year old doesn't need a babysitter! Also, I wish what Zach did wasn't quite so horrific or more time was spent on how he thought Jack was going to be freed in 5 minutes


He says it at one point, but they never talk about it
The forgiveness was too abrupt for the enormity of the offense


I loved the setting and themes of the story, though.

I&#8217;m not normally a big &#8216;paranormal&#8217; reader, but the Harvest Festival really worked for me. It has just the right amount of suspense with just a touch of romance to keep you turning the pages and seeing what is going to happen next.This book has a huge &#8220;YA&#8221; feel to it and I feel that this was written VERY WELL for that specific genre. I really like this authors writing style. It&#8217;s easy to follow and read. I was sucked into the storyline at the very beginning of the book. I was hooked to this book all the way to the very last page. The ending really leaves you hanging&#8230; so obviously I can&#8217;t wait to read Fallen Oaks #2.
