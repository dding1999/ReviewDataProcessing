$review_text.: One of my all-time favorite "miniseries", this is a visually gorgeous romantic film with a fairly good historical foundation
Even if it had nothing going for it but the sets, costumes and score it would be worth seeing.Have an old uncut VHS tape of it; but unfortunately our VCR died and has been replaced by a DVD player

When it's available in that format I want to be the first to know
 Recommended!



$SUMMARY.: Please release it on DVD!

$REVIEW.: I have seen a number of movies in my lifetime about Arthur and his  Knights of the Round Table
 This one would be in my bottom three.It had some good moments, but the bad sequences went on for ever (seems like 1500 years)
 They could have done a great movie with a better script and special effects


 The acting was sad

 I have seen better acting in elementary school plays.Craig Sheffer's acting talents were never utilized in playing Mordred


 Patrick Bergin's Arthur was more like a court jester than the boy who drew the sword from the stone to become the great king of legends
 Guinevere and Lancelot were bit players in a bad production
 The tragedy of their illicit love caused the fall of Camelot aided by Morgana was captured a bit by this movie.The two children, Kate and Ritchie, had some good moments, especially when they helped Merlin in the laboratory of Joan Maxwell who was never called Doctor Maxwell, but Miss Maxwell unless I missed it
There was an opportunity with Joan Maxwell to explore why she wanted to free Mordred

 She wanted the freedom to do her research without interference


 Too many times scientists become pawns of the powerful


 This would have been a good theme to explore, but it was left as a passing comment


 Unfortunately, too many great themes were left on the floor in this movie.One of these themes was that Guinevere still loved Arthur


 After spending 1500 years with Lancelot, she realized that a piece of shining armour is not always a comfort in another dimension.When Guinevere gave Kate her wedding ring, this was another opportunity since Ritchie was knighted by Arthur that he and Kate would carry on the legacy of Arthur under Merlin's tutorage
 This is definitely implied, but the theme could have been expanded.One star may seem harsh to those who love this movie, but given the context of the Arthurian vault of movies in existence, this is why one star was given.

$REVIEW.: I haven't read the book, I'm a catholic (not a very good one, but...) and I really had no preconceived notion about THE DA VINCI CODE before going in, other than the fact that lots of people were talking about it and it more or less bashes the catholic religion.There is one line in DA VINCI CODE that describes this movie in one sentence better than anybody can in a review. It somewhere along the lines of, "People rarely notice things right in front of their eyes."The genius of DA VINCI CODE is that, that line is so very true. We have been blinded by repetitive images. Television. Politics. Religion. We don't question, we just live and assume. Not only is that true, but the movie proves it with unmistakable evidence that will throw you for a loop and have you questioning your very lives.Anyway, THE DA VINCI CODE is ultimately, fiction. Yet, more than any other fiction to date, blurs the line of fiction and reality successfully. Despite all the things that are suggested in the DA VINCI CODE that would turn traditional religion on its ear, the movie pleads its case with great visuals, history, symbols, hidden meanings and unmistakable question marks hidden in real paintings by Leonardo Da Vinci.How many times have we've seen DaVinci's THE LAST SUPPER? Hundreds? Thousands? Yet, we are blind to the unmistakable questions that the movie poses about the painting. Sure, DaVinci obviously wasn't there at the time of the Last Supper, but it's still fun thinking about the questions his painting poses.THE DA VINCI CODE continues to pour on the evidence as the movie goes forward, leaving a lasting impression on your mind and your grasp of the stories we may or may not have been forced to believe throughout our lives. If anything, THE DA VINCI CODE, all be it fiction, stimulates the brain and makes you want to know more about Jesus Christ, Leonardo DaVinci and Mary Magdalene. That may be its greatest asset.After watching DA VINCI CODE, I find it hard to believe that there were so many bad reviews. Either they are people who are really really jaded and watch too many movies, or their religious types who are offended by the movies potential implications.The way I see it, God gave us brains so that we could walk, talk, think and help each other. He gave us rational thought so that we could decipher for ourselves what is right and wrong and not to just believe because we were told to.Ultimately, it's just a movie, and a darn good one.

$review_text.: I was so looking forward to see The Richard Donner cut of Superman II and I was thriled when I learnt Amazon shipped my copy of The HD DVD version.As soon as I received I popped it into the player.How did I like the new version? Well I think it's a mix bag,I did enjoy some of the new scenes such as with Lex Luthor,but theres some scenes I did not like,such as the new scene where Lois finaly figures out Clark is Superman.I thought the scene in the Lester version was mutch better and when Lois find out his secret in the Lester version she pures her heart out to Superman and declaring her love for him,that is gone in The Donner cut.And yes I too like alot of other people did not like the new ending,I think they should of used Lesters ending.Other then these small complaints I enjoyed watching the new version of Superman 2 and in High Def.Warner did a great job with this release.I do hope Warner will also release The Lester version of 2 on HD DVD also? And yeah I know alot of people hated 3 and 4 but I would like to have them as well in HD.Great stuff!

$REVIEW.: It's amazing to see how group dynamics work.  When people are in a group situation and a &#34;mob&#34; mentality sets in, rational thought seems to go out the window.  If you add in other stress of life, work, and time, things can get out of hand very quickly.  It's hard to believe that a &#34;prank call&#34; can go this far, but, unfortunately this one did.  All it takes is one thinking person to end the charade, but again, group dynamics take over and thinking isn't as important as &#34;getting through it.&#34;  The movie is disturbing, but it's worth at least one watch.

$review_text.: &quot;The Strongest Man in the World&quot; is far from the best movie Disney studios produced in its family-film heyday (late '50's to early '80's).  However, I still find it to be quite enjoyable, especially the beginning and ending half-hours, which are quite funny.  So why only one star?  BECAUSE IT IS NOT IN WIDESCREEN, BUT IN A CUT-RATE 1:33:1 FULLSCREEN PRINT, with no special features whatsoever.So what's up, Disney?  Do you think we viewers are a bunch of lunkheads who can't handle widescreen?  Then why not OFFER BOTH VERSIONS?  After all, there's enough room on the disc for both, especially since you don't include special features at all on your second-tier titles.I give Disney much credit for it's special editions and Vault Classics Collections for presenting beautifully restored, widescreen prints with wonderful special features like vintage newsreels and cartoons.  And thanks to the recent special editions of &quot;Apple Dumpling Gang&quot; and &quot;Escape to Witch Mountain,&quot; I now know how my favorite child stars of the '70's (Kim Richards, Clay O'Brien, Stacey Manning, Brad Savage, etc.) look and are doing nearly thirty-years later as adults.But there is simply no excuse for throwing the rest of their titles into such thoughtless and cheesy packages.  &quot;Blackbeard's Ghost&quot; simply looks terrible in fullscreen, as does &quot;Follow Me Boys.&quot;  I have no doubt &quot;Stongest Man...&quot; does too.  So buyer beware, and join us widescreen lovers in holding out for product worth buying.Incidentally, &quot;Now You See Him Now You Don't,&quot; the previous title in this series is in widescreen, while the first film &quot;Computer Wore Tennis Shoes&quot; isn't.  God only knows why.

$REVIEW.: The accolades accorded to the two leading male actors in this movie are well deserved.What only slowly grew in my consciousness is the outstandingly nuanced performance by the actress Sidse Babett Knudsen, in her role as Jorgen Hansson's wife Helene.  I did not immediately recognize the varied dimensions of this finely nuanced performance, a hidden treasure which I only gradually realized through repeated, extended exposure, coupled with my increasing understanding of the underlying psychological dynamics which this actress's film character may have been experiencing, and which this actress's performance sought to convey - which she does with aplomb.Sidse Babett Knudsen's acting is remarkable for another reason: she is playing more than just one role, she is playing three: (tycoon's) wife, mother, and former lover.  Each of these roles requires very distinct character acting, each of which this actress plays distinctively, convincingly, and with powerful feminine magnetism.Some of the most compelling and effective acting by Sidse Babette Knudsen, as Helene Hansson, is principally conveyed by this actress's wide range of captivating facial expressions, many of which were so subtle and discreet as to be barely perceptible (see her tete-a-tete with Mads Mikkelsen, conducted over a side table at her manor house) - this caliber and range of acting is terrific stuff.I am not bothered, like some, by numerous close-up shots of the film's four principal characters.  Aren't we talking frontal cortex here? I feel these close-up shots are valid and effective, sometime capturing a film character's private, interior moments, and sometimes a film character's behavioral sine qua non - as with the pivotal realization by Jorgen Hansson's wife Helene, to remarks by the grandmother re her son Jorgen's chauffeur, etc. (followed by a close-up shot of a chandelier's dangling glass chimes).Intimate, "non-invasive" close-up shots, taken from the side, enable the tender capture of  "getting to know you" or "catching up" moments, when a young girl touchingly examins the facial expressions of her newly-discovered biological father, to see whether he is genuinely interested in viewing the pictures in her childhood photo album.Considering the magnitude and nature of the information which this film's principal characters have to process, and when and in what contexts they have to process it, close-up shots of eyes may be considered to be part of this film's "action" - as, in fact, it is.I doubt that this film's type of intimate psychological action could be conveyed effectively to an audience in stage acting, where an audience is relatively distant from actors, as it can be conveyed in a film's intimate, and sometimes mandatory, close-up shots, as we see in this film.It's unfortunate for those of us who do not watch or are not saturated or jaded by soap opera, etc., to be burdened and distracted by some commentators' cheapening, maudlin comparisons of this refreshing, high quality film to, e.g., soap opera.

As I understand it, it was pulled because some religious fanatics in the South managed to successfully encourage sponsors to pull their advertising from the show, thus resulting in an early cancellation.  I guess what I don't understand is why are "Christians" watching the Logo network if they believe homosexuality is such a sin??  Leave us alone and let us have our shows.

$review_text.: This set of videos combines excellent archival footage of WWII, the first major conflict captured extensively on film, with excellent narration by Olivier to create a stirring and chilling view of the war that set the  stage for the second half of the 20th century.I have watched this set of  videos several times.  They rate, in my book, among the best documentary  materials available on WWII.  If you were to combine this video set with  print works like &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&quot; and  &quot;At Dawn We Slept&quot; you would have a powerful combination of  documented works and video material.As another reviewer aptly pointed  out, this series is slanted heavily to materials from the European Theater  of operations.  Perhaps that is because there was simply more material  available on that part of the war.  Maybe it's because much of the fighing  in the Pacific leaned in favor of the Japanese for so long.While this  video series is excellent, it is not, in my opinion, for everyone.  I do  not plan to let my children watch this until they are a bit older.  They  should probably be out of elem school before they see footage about the  concentration camps, etc.There is good footage, good commentary, and a  somber soundtrack that brings the project together.5 starsAlan  Holyoak

$review_text.: Flightplan is a gripping airplane suspense story about a widowed mother (Jodie Foster) who's 6-year old daughter gets lost on the plane flying back from Berlin to New York -- with her husband's casket in the cargo hold.  Foster gets panicky as she searches the plane and tries to persuade the crew to help.  As the suspense keeps mounting, the story almost takes on a twilight-zone eeriness as the flight attendants deny the girl ever boarded the plane.  Though they all act as if they believe Foster is deluded, the pilot allows a thorough search of the plane to humor her.  Peter Saarsgard (Shattered Glass, Skeleton Key) plays an ineffectual air marshall who finally goes through motions of helping her, for a time.Foster plays it just right and her performance together with good writing, directing, and editing, almost make us doubt her sanity, even though we saw the girl board with her.I've heard of other reviews that claim the ending is disappointing because it's far-fetched.  I saw the movie before hearing that, and I was quite satisfied with the end, even though a few scenes did seem far-fetched.  I think with such a tremendous suspense build up, it would be hard to have a perfect ending that lives up to it; at least the end isn't a copout.On the whole I found the movie more engrossing than the current competitor, Red-Eye, which I also liked but found parts of the ending far more unbelievable than Flightplan.

$REVIEW.: I read the book and found it incredibly compelling and one of the best WWII books I have ever read.  The book presented things in a sequential manner but the movie bounced back and forth between the battle, the bond tour and as elderly gentlemen.Well I don't have to tell you that this it not Saving Private Ryan.  Is it real life.  It is very sad and disturbing but it is what it is.  It was war.  It was about a horribly bloody battle that many brave young men gruesomly died in.  It is about how 3 surviving guys that just happened to be there to help stand up the second flagpole on Surabaci and their picture made it safely to Guam to be developed and was safely "electronically" transmitted to NY and put on the front of the NYTimes.  It is about how they were used to raise money for the war effort.  I guess it is something we can't fathom today but America was broke and they really needed $14B.  These 3 guys helped raise that money.  One loved it, one hated it and one just did it.The scenes on Iwo Jima were an off color kind of black and white (except for the US flag).  Very powerful.I would highly recommend seeing this film.  It is sad but it is reality.  No sugar coating.  I truly enjoyed it.  But I must say when Mike Strank died I cried just like when I read the book.

$REVIEW.: In 1938, the political situation in Europe was rapidly deteriorating as the maniacal demon Adolph Hitler cast the black veil of Nazism across the continent first with the Anschluss and then later the Munich Crisis.  Against this grim background, the film "Three Comrades" opened, a picture of postwar Germany, in the first troubled years of the doomed Weimar Republic.  Based on a 1937 novel by Erich Maria Remarque, the three comrades are young German soldiers who fight together in World War I, and despite a fatalistic attitude at the surrender try to make a life together afterwards.  They are the pragmatic, paternal Otto Koster (Franchot Tone), the idealistic Gottfried Lenz (Robert Young) and the callow Erich Lohkamp (Robert Taylor) who is like a younger brother to the other two.  Together they open a taxi and auto repair shop, and just about scrape by in the depressed German economy.  The trio's one luxury is the car they jointly own, known by the affectionate moniker "Baby".  One Sunday to celebrate Erich's birthday they drive "Baby" out to a country inn where they meet the young, lovely Patricia Hollmann (Margaret Sullavan), a worldly though impoverished aristocrat.  All three men are entranced by her charm, but Erich seems to make the strongest impression with Pat.  She is touched by his naivet&eacute; and despite her sophistication falls in love with his simple goodness.  However their happiness is shadowed by Pat's condition, she is recovering from tuberculosis which has played havoc with her permanent health, and she is in remission not cured.  Under these circumstances, Pat is reluctant to marry Erich, although she is deeply in love with him, but Otto persuades her.  Their joy is fleeting however when Pat suffers a serious relapse and must retreat to a sanatorium in the Alps.  While Otto and Erich desperately try to earn enough to pay the mounting bills, Gottfried becomes dangerously involved in the precarious political situation.One of the reasons "Three Comrades" is noteworthy is that it's the one screen credit that acclaimed author F. Scott Fitzgerald earned.  Regrettably screenwriting was not his forte, and only about a third of the finished screenplay belongs to him, Fitzgerald was considered too literary and wordy by producer Joseph Mankiewicz, who also was an excellent writer and along with screenwriter Edward E. Paramore Jr. wound up rewriting the script.  However, "Three Comrades" is more diluted than the actual novel which covered almost a ten year period from the end of the war to the rise of Nazism.  The film concludes in 1922, and the gangs of thugs that play a part in it are never clearly identified as to their political affiliation, although it's presumed they're Nazis.  It wasn't until 1940 that MGM had the courage to take on the Nazis in the excellent "The Mortal Storm" also starring Miss Sullavan and Mr. Young.The three men playing the comrades give good performances particularly Franchot Tone whose Otto is the father figure for all the others including Pat, and on whom they all rely on for advice.  Robert Young although affable and likeable on screen was rather lightweight, here gives one of his better portrayals as the ill-fated Gottfried.  It seems as if Robert Taylor needed to play against superb actresses to draw out his acting talent, in "Camille" it's Garbo, in "Waterloo Bridge" it's Vivien Leigh, here Margaret Sullavan does the trick.  Several reliable supporting players, Monty Woolley, Guy Kibbee, Charley Grapewin , Henry Hull and Lionel Atwell  do well in minor roles.Still, make no mistake, what makes this film so memorable all these many years later and worth a viewing is the star performance of the unforgettable Margaret Sullavan.  This was the second in a quartet of roles as German women from the Weimar Republic through the Nazi era, the first "Little Man, What Now?", followed by "The Mortal Storm" and "So Ends Our Night", this last also based on a Remarque novel.  In addition this marked a reunion of Miss Sullavan with director Frank Borzage who had previously directed her in "Little Man, What Now?", and would direct her afterwards in "The Shining Hour" and "The Mortal Storm".  Margaret Sullavan was a unique, special actress,  writer David Shipman in his book "The Great Movie Stars: the Golden Years" described her as "an enchantress pitched in terms of magnetism and personality somewhere (curiously enough) between the two Hepburns."  That's just about right, she also possessed one of the most singular speaking voices in films, it's warm, throaty cadences and inflections labeled as "liquid diamonds and sand", again very apt.In her portrayal of the noble, self-sacrificing Pat Hollmann, Miss Sullavan could easily tip the scale toward bathos, but she turns in a delicately shaded performance, beautifully realized full of subtle nuance and detail.  Her final scenes are particularly touching and will tug at your heartstrings.  Miss Sullavan was justly rewarded as the Best Actress of 1938 by the New York Film Critics Circle and also as recipient of the Picturegoer Gold Medal, but although nominated the Best Actress Oscar eluded her, going instead to Bette Davis' more febrile, flamboyant role in "Jezebel", what a pity!  She missed out on two key  career making roles;  first the unnamed second Mrs. DeWinter in the 1940 film "Rebecca" despite a screen test and being a strong contender, later on she would turn down the role of Blanche du Bois in the original Broadway production of "A Streetcar Named Desire", both were infinitely poorer for her absence.  Other missed opportunities would be two F. Scott Fitzgerald characters; she would have been the perfect Daisy Buchanan in "The Great Gatsby" and ditto Nicole Diver in "Tender Is the Night".  This is an actress that needs to have a major retrospective.  Margaret Sullavan's film oeuvre is slim, just 16 films, but she illuminated each one with her artistry, being  a sure mistress of both comedy and drama. This is evidenced not only by "Three Comrades" and the superior soap opera, "Back Street", but also the zany "The Moon's Our Home" with ex-husband Henry Fonda and best of all the delightful, enchanting 1940 Ernest Lubitsch film "The Shop Around the Corner", with her most frequent and perfect co-star, James Stewart.

$REVIEW.: **SPOILERS**The question before us is this:  would you stay married to a person you'd just recently met  (and whom you could barely stand) if you knew that, after six months as a couple, you would be free to go your separate ways and - here's the really good part - be handed a prize of $3,000,000 for your trouble?  If that sounds like the setup for yet another of those preposterously cheesy TV reality shows, think again.  It's actually the premise of "What Happens in Vegas," a big-budget romantic comedy starring Ashton Kutcher and Catherine Diaz as two Manhattanites who get more than they bargained for when they head to Sin City for an emotional pick-me-up after suffering major traumas in their lives.  Jack has recently been fired from his carpentry job (by his own father no less), while Joy has suffered the humiliation of being dumped by her fiance in front of all their mutual friends.  When the two strangers meet, it's instant pandemonium, thanks to an adjoining hotel bathroom, an abundance of free-flowing liquor, some quickie nuptials and a slot-machine jackpot worth $1.5 million dollars per person.Just how this couple winds up getting hitched - and why so much money is involved in the outcome - need not be detailed here. All you need to know is that "What Happens in Vegas" plays out with all the cliches one would expect from a romantic comedy, as Jack and Joy hurl objects and invective at one another until, as if by magic, it suddenly dawns on them how truly, madly, deeply in love with each other they are and that maybe, with a little teamwork and effort, they could make this marriage thing work for real.  To complete the totality of the clich&eacute;, both Jack and Joy are saddled with best friends (Rob Corddry and Lake Bell, respectively) who function as wacky, wisecracking sidekicks - and who help them pull off all the insufferably inane, mean-spirited tricks the principal characters play on each other.  Jason Sudeikis, Queen Latifah, Dennis Miller and Treat Williams also put in appearances, though my suspicion is that they`d be more than happy to have this particular turkey expunged from their acting resumes toot sweet.The sad fact is that it's a mite difficult to develop a rooting interest in a relationship in which the two individuals display all the wit and emotional maturity of a couple of developmentally-disabled five-year-olds.  The lower these two otherwise attractive people stoop in their treatment of one another, the more disheartening - and less funny - the movie itself becomes.

$REVIEW.: this man may very well be the grand interpreter of the mass consciousness of the dumb half of the united states


on top of that, it's brutally unfunny


his set on the blue collar comedy tour seems mercifully short and might as well be "citizen kane" compared to this gala of idiocy

comedy this dangerously insipid, brain-dead, and not to mention totally unfunny should be outlawed

no one is as dumb as larry the cable guy professes to be; true

however, everyone i know who comes close votes republican
what does that mean? who cares

now click "no" and tell me my review wasn't helpful
sorry, but if you like larry the cable guy in the first place i think you're most likely beyond help.all told, if you're into the mean-spirited rantings of an inbred jackass on the mentally challenged, gloriously naive and simplistic views on politics, ignorant critiques of immigrants, or banal and crude sexist humor then be my guest and lose a few brain cells while you're at it
it's not like you were using them anyway

this guy should have headlined the republican national convention; he would have killed.and before you call me a sissy or a "girly man" for not finding this dolt hilarious like california cretin already did, i can definately deal with gay bashing and racist humor


i love south park, family guy, and chappelle's show; all of which have employed all of those comedic elements in one way or another


however, those shows are satiric in nature and avoid rolling in their own molasses-thick vitriol, unlike ol' larry

i've lived in the south all my life and his hometown is a day trip away...as such i think i can offer my opinion with much more authenticity.my review of the blue collar comedy tour goes much deeper into why i can't stand this guy.

The American recipe for freedom and good living without any of the big brother nonsense that actually threatens both freedom and happiness. Today's progressives would probably not like it, but this is the real thing.A wonderful film everyone should see to admire America's significant contribution to civilization and to learn some law and civics.

$review_text.: Wow.  How this incredibly satisfying little independent film didn't garner more attention during its brief theatrical release is an absolute mystery to me.  I heard of it via the Golden Globe and Academy Award nomination for Patricia Clarkson (whose work I've always been attracted to), and I picked it up for a view before the Academy Awards to see what she had done.  Little did I know that virtually every performance in this sweet film could easily have garnered a Best Supporting nod.April (the ever-more-lovely Katie Holmes) -- the black sheep of the typical American family -- faces the daunting challenge of 'piecing' together a Thanksgiving day meal for her family.  As it turns out, the meal will more than likely be the last for her mother (Clarkson) as she is suffering from terminal cancer.  The narrative gravitates between three storylines: (1) April racing around the apartment building desperately in need of help in completing the dinner; (2) her boyfriend's quest to find a great looking suit with which to make a great impression on April soon-to-arrive family; and (3) April's family driving from wherever to April's seedy city apartment for dinner.What works best about PIECES OF APRIL is the story: entirely believeable and poignant, the viewer gets captured by April's antics at dealing with unreasonable neighbors as well as Clarkson offering tips about 'rolling a better joint' to her young &quot;photog&quot; son.  All of these moments are infused with as much whimsy as they are heartache; these moments point up the utter chaos that IS the modern family, but they also point toward a hope for the future in, as Oliver Platt puts it, &quot;building new memories.&quot;The urban aspect to APRIL works but basically serves as a narrative hook against which to compare and contrast the expectations the small-town family has.  Largely, it serves as a source for laughter, which works, too.The ending, however, really deserves mention.  It trickles up almost unpredictably, and it delivers such an emotional wallop -- sensitive without being senselessness -- that I would find anyone hard pressed to walk away from this film without a serious lump in the throat.Immediately after viewing, I went out and bought my own copy.  It's just that good.

Where were the bugs, and the guns, and the intergalactic space armies?  What happened to the hardcoreness of Johnny Rico?  And remember how there were bugs that flew?  WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO THAT MOVIE?!?!?!  'Cause it sure wasn't in this piece of garbage I'll tell you that.  Starship Troopers 2 was not Starship Troopers 2.  It was not a sequel.  It was some abnormally stupid pile of filth that seems to have resulted from throwing Aliens, The Faculty, and Species together in a blender and pressing puree without ever checking to make sure the ingredients you threw in the blender would in fact make what you wanted.  BLEEECCCHHHH!!!It has been said countless times before about movies.  "Glitter was the worst movie ever."  "Swept Away was the worst movie ever."  Those people are wrong.  Starship Troopers 2 is the worst movie ever.  Fans of sci-fi, horror, even softcore porn should be appalled at this tripe and the studio that expects us to stomach garbage like this.  The heroism of Johnny Rico deserves more than this, you banana boning gremlin droppings.  Maybe before you make a sequel you should watch the movie you're following up so you know what actually happened.

$review_text.: "Charly" is based on Daniel Keyes's short story turned into a novel "Flowers for Algernon."  The story was about Charly Gordon, a man who, in the parlance of the time, was mentally retarded


 As part of a scientific experiment he is given a drug that turns him into a genius
 The Algernon of the title is a lab rat who was the first guinea pig for this treatment

 However, the treatment proves to be only temporary


 Both versions of Keyes's story were done as diary entries, which provided a graphic indication of how Charly is changing.The 1968 movie version, of course, opens up the story and gets away from the first-person perspective that made "Flowers for Algernon" so compelling
 To add insult to injury, there is now a romance between Charly with a character named Alice Kinian (Claire Bloom)

 Of course, this changes the whole dynamic of the film, at the cost of the poignancy of Charly's relationship with Algernon

 As the title character Cliff Robertson won the Oscar and clearly the problem is not with his performance but rather with Stirling Silliphant's screenplay

 Still, to be fair, any film adaptation of the fragile original story was going to lose what made it so great.Consequently, this is one of those films that you will enjoy more if you have not read "Flowers for Algernon."  Of course, if you have not read either the short story or the novel, you should
 At least this was an intelligence "science fiction" film for its day, certainly a more human story than other films of that era, such as "2001: A Space Odyssey."

$review_text.: I used to live at Rolling Hills Golf and Country Club where CADDYSHACK was filmed, and from my third floor apartment overlooking the eighteenth hole I got to hear every line of dialogue in this film repeated ad nauseam by wannabe Rodneys, Chevys, Teds and Bill Murrays. I also got to see careless golfers' carts tip over, dumping them into the lake, something that should have been in this film, but wasn't.Frankly, I've never understood why CADDYSHACK rates so very high amongst comedies. The individual comedic performances are consistently very funny (and in Rodney Dangerfield's case, truly inspired), but this film always has struck me as LESS than the sum of its parts.In CADDYSHACK I always feel as though I'm watching a dozen competing stand-up acts a la the cable show MAKE ME LAUGH. The various bits (such as the infamous pool scene) are individually hilarious. Unfortunately, none of it meshes comfortably into a cohesive whole, and I never find myself wholeheartedly enjoying this film.And, considering it was an afterthought anyhow, I wish they'd lose the gopher entirely. Man, that shtick is just plain dumb.

$review_text.: You may have stumbled across this as Horror Planet.  Then it was renamed and issued a new title, not unlike Contamination (not to be confused with Contagion) which was also released as Alien Contamination.  I'll breakdown the premise for you--as if the title didn't blatantly perform that task already.  A team sets out on an archaeological expedition to another planter investigating a tomb that when unreported from a previous, abandoned expedition.  Their goal is to identify the cause of extinction of an alien species.  Now since the planet's surface temperature is a constant 89 degrees below zero, and noting the title of the movie, I'm gonna' go ahead and guess that this un-heavenly body has been serving as a big alien sperm bank.The story jumpstarts when some of the investigators are spelunking through bauxite cave and see a moving shadowy figure inside a crusty white chrysalis-looking structure which, for no reason at all, just explodes!  An unconscious scientist is then rushed to the medical bay clinging to a handful of crystals which contain "living matter."  The "exposed" crew begin to exhibit a bit of space madness.  What maddened me was that neither these crystals nor the explosion were ever explained.  In fact, these scenes should not have been included in the movie.  Deleting them, with no replacement whatsoever, would actually improve the movie.This flirts with being an exploitation movie, but never quite crosses the line.  The alien resembles some anatomical structures you may recall high school sex ed.  When we first see the "Inseminoid" it is inseminating a female crew member (who, of course, is naked on an examination table).  As if possessed, the now-impregnated and considerably stronger woman gets a little stabby with a colleague.  Naturally this worked up an appetite, so then she eats a corpse.The violence (I hesitate to call it "action") is very poorly executed and complemented with the liberal overuse of blood.  Other gore is minimal and uncommon; a severed head prosthetic here, a cut up leg there.  I expected more.  I guess the F/X store ran out of rubber guts. I was hoping that some scenes would look like throwing a side of beef in a wood chipper.  Needless to say, I was disappointed.  Making matters worse, this movie really doesn't go anywhere.

$review_text.: Good horror films aren't just tales about horrifying events. Instead, they are stories about people in horrifying circumstances.The distinction is critical, and that's where the vast majority of horror films fail. They portray events without relating the horror to the film's characters - or worse, they leave us not caring at all and able only to think about the graphic nature of the film.Some think "The Descent" is a movie about six women who 'descend' into a cave and are attacked by man-eating monsters. Yes, those things occur. But that is not what the movie is about. The monsters only catalyzed the most horrifying aspects of the story.  "The Descent" easily could have been made without them."The Descent" is a tale about friendship, adventure, and betrayal; it's about the women's descent into savagery as the price they paid for grim survival; and, for one, it's about a final plunge into madness. This film wasn't made in Hollywood, so don't look for a happy ending. While the US release has an outwardly softer ending than the British version, appearances can be deceptive.This wasn't a perfect movie.  It did contain a few noticeable flaws, but the flaws faded to insignificance because of the power of the lean story-telling. I was surprised by this movie, pleasantly so. It was much more than I expected, and more than any recent horror movie I have seen for many, many years.I highly recommend it.  And, having seen both the US and the UK versions, I believe the UK version is slightly superior.  The ending is simply a better fit - although strangely, while the UK ending is outwardly darker than the the US version, in a very real sense, it also is a more merciful end to the tale.

$review_text.: This review is of the movie and not the blu ray version. Though I will say it looks great on dvd. First of all, I will agree that some movies should not be taken too seriously. Why should it, when the main character is a bit larger than life (physically and metaphorically) she sometimes went up againsat dinosaurs in the game, so why is this one so over the top or hard to believe? I've always like the games, because I have always loved strong women (not bodybuilder strong. i mean strong in character) Lara Croft is a kick ass chick with a brain. She's eye candy in some respects but she's not a girlie girl. She's strong, yet feminine but always one step ahead of her male competitors if they can even keep up. The movie to me captured the character perfectly. Maybe it deviated a bit from the game at times, but then again with each new game they tend to deviate from the established canon. And seriously, is there anyone more perfect to play Lara than Angelina Jolie? she embodies the same character traits as Lara, and she exudes sexuality even in the most mundane situations. A lot of times women in action movies do not get the same credit as males in the same genre, but Jolie deserves to be ranked right up there with Harrison Ford and Tom Cruise or even a Shwartzenneger or stallone. Actually I'm surprised she wasn't asked to be in the Expendables. She's a top action star, and to say that she was "lesser known" at the time of the movie is a bit misleading, she won an oscar and did some great films, and most fanboys already know about Gia (which I happened to bump into when I was flipping through channels on cable) so the choice to pick her was a no-brainer. I love how an oscar winner can still get down and dirty with the rest of us, she's not too hung up on winning an oscar that she feels that action or comedy is beneath her. This movie rocks. The special effects are great and remind you of the games. Just like any movie based on a video game or comic book, there usually are updates/upgrades for the feature film, but I don't feel that harms this movie one bit. I think this is a great movie and anyone who is a fan of action movies or fan of video game movies will not be disappointed, and anyone who is looking for a serious plot and character development go read Crime and Punishment or Dante's Inferno. Action movies do not need to be overly thought out. We know she's a treasure hunter, we know she's the baddest one in the game and we know she won't lose, so sit back and enjoy and try not to overthink it.

$review_text.: James D'arcy is perfectly cast in the title role as Nicholas Nickleby, a young, well-meaning but penniless gentleman who tries to earn an honest living to support his loving mother and sister who are dependent on him. First, he accepts a position as a teacher at a Yorkshire boarding school, not realising the horror that awaits him at the school run by the cruel Mr Squeers. When he could no longer endure the cruelty and atrocity inflicted by Squeers on the young children, he runs away from the school, followed by a boy (Smike) who has long suffered abuse and gross mistreatment at the hands of Squeers. Both Nicholas and Smike quickly become inseparable, loyal friends. By a strange chance, they go on to become actors at a small theatre run by the Crummles family. After being long separated from his mother and sister, Nicholas later leaves the theatre and makes a hasty return home to save his sister from a sinister plot cooked up by his evil uncle, Ralph Nickleby (played by Charles Dance). Ralph is a rich, old miser with a heart of stone who hates Nicholas intensely (mainly because he is jealous of Nicholas's youth and goodness of heart).James D'arcy's "Nicholas" is endearing and wonderful to watch. If you are a female viewer, you will be most pleasantly surprised (and awed) by his uncommon good looks. He is so strikingly handsome and will make you swoon! He reminds me of a young Ralph Fiennes (the eyes and upper part of the face) and Ethan Hawke (the lower part of the face).The beautiful Sophia Myles is also well cast as Nicholas's sister, Kate, a sweet and wholesome-looking girl who has to fend off unwanted male attentions wherever she goes.The many supporting characters (queer, eccentric folks, all) help spice up the plot and inject much humour into the story. Most notably, the Squeers family (an incredibly obnoxious and hateful family), the Mantalinis (a lovey-dovey couple who runs a fashion house; but they fight a lot too), the Crummles family (who owns the theatre), the generous Cheeryble twin brothers, Newman Noggs (Ralph Nickleby's reluctant assistant) and Arthur Gride (a hideous-looking and repulsive old man who plots to marry the beautiful Madeline Bray who also happens to be the object of Nicholas's affection). My only complaint is that the actress who plays Madeline Bray has too much make-up on (her face is too thickly powdered and it shows because you see that her neck is tan). Also, the scarlet red lipstick is unsuitable for her character who is supposed to be a simple, poor girl who would not have the time, money nor inclination to buy or use make-up!I feel this adaptation does good to leave out some of the minor characters from Dicken's novel because they do not serve the plot much, such as the large Kenwigs family and the madman who lives next door to Mrs Nickleby (Nicholas's mother). Otherwise, this production would be another hour long, at least.I thoroughly enjoyed this adaptation and would recommend it to all fans of high quality period drama.

$REVIEW.: This DVD set contains the first four movies, arguably the best four, of the POLICE ACADEMY series.  Once Steve Guttenberg left the franchise the following movies were of a direct-to-video quality.  The original POLICE ADADEMY is now a classic.  There are some truly funny bits in this film. Michael Winslow was at his freshest and funniest.  The trailing three films were okay, but for the most part they were repackaged versions of the first film.This specific collection is a very economical way to collect the original four movies.  So my bottom line is that it is well worth the nominal price, under $10 in some stores, to pick up a copy.  It certainly allowed me to finally dispatch my VHS copies.As noted in other reviews this collection has a few nitpicky drawbacks:  These are double sided DVDs which are awkward to handle and more prone to scratches.  The picture quality is superior to that of the VHS versions, but not quite the digitally remastered product we have come to expect in this day and age.  Finally only two of the movies are presented in widescreen.  Whether the lack of widescreen was intentional or not is anyone's guess.This DVD set is a great value if you enjoy the POLICE ACADEMY movies, but are not an absolute die hard fan.

$review_text.: This particular effort by Charlton Heston is certainly worth a look, at least once.  In some ways, this film shows subtle hints of being just ever so slightly "campy" (in the way that many early 80's films can be), particularly during some of the initial opening sequences.  However, overall, this film "is" entertaining, even if most of the major plot points are reasonably predictable.  There are many, many reviews describing the basic story line, so I will refrain from simply rehashing what has already been clearly explained.  In my opinion, Charlton Heston gives a tremendous performance, and is truly believed as his colorful character when watching this film, even today in current times.  Kim Basinger is obviously very "green" with her acting skills in this movie, as it was one of her first, and it tends to show.  For example, you will definitely not be seeing the Basinger performance which was offered in "Cellular" a handful of years back.  However, she does turn in an adequate performance, and you do wish her character well.  Nick Mancuso seems like he's trying just a little to hard to convince us much of the time, and it tends to come off as slightly less than genuine.  But, once again, the performance of Heston makes up for these other quirks and weaknesses of the film.  The amazing scenery, and filming techniques used, certainly add to the appeal of the movie.  This definitely was a lower budget film, with a small cast, and a relatively simple and predictable plot by today's standard, so please set your expectations accordingly.  This truly is a very watchable film, just be sure to place it in your mailbox for less than ten dollars, if you can.  One or two viewings may be enough for many people.Now, . . . regarding this particular DVD release.  The widescreen format picture quality is very strong for a modest budget project from nearly 30 years ago.  The contrast is great, the colors are strong, and the clarity is definitely "good" (not spectacular).  However, the soundtrack for the film is lackluster at best.  The tones and sound effects which are more toward the "loud" range sound "okay".  But, the more intricate conversational dialogue is notably under amplified, and I often found myself "maxing" out the volume range (simultaneously) on both the television speakers and separate surround sound system.  Altering the sound settings didn't seem to help in any significant way.  Be prepared to keep your audio remote in hand and ready to go!!!GOOD LUCK.
$SUMMARY.: Entertaining, . . . Turn Up The Sound!!!

$review_text.: Hilary and Jackie is the story of the DuPre sisters.  From an early age both were rising musical stars, Hilary on the flute and Jackie on the cello.  But Jackie's flamboyant playing style brought her attention and then fame.  While Hilary has her style eradicated and settles for an ordinary life.The film is broken into four sections.  The first part is the girl's childhood together.  It takes the girls from prodigies to Jackie's first success.  One night Jackie is playing at a wedding for an Italian princess with Hilary looking on and the next morning she is swept away for a concert tour, leaving her sister alone in a foreign country with no explanation of what happened to her sister.The second part is Hilary's life apart from her sister.  Hilary has her musical life sucked from her by the musical establishment.  But one thing she does find is love and she settles for a country life with her husband raising their two daughters.  During this part of the film we see some bizarre behavior from Jackie with no explanation behind what is happening.The third part is Jackie's life apart from her sister.  Jackie really never wanted the fame that was thrust upon her.  Jackie is isolated from everyone she cares about and most of the time cannot communicate with the people around her.  Even to find out how to wash her clothes.  But she does find her true love and they become the super couple of classical music.  But things are amiss with her health.The last part is Jackie's fight with MS.  In the 1950's they really did not know much about the disease and how to treat it.  Jackie was under the impression with time and exercise that she would overcome her disease.  What she finds out is that not only does the disease get worse but society isolates her because of it.  Just as the two sisters reconcile, Jackie dies.This film is brilliant on many levels but it is the performance by Emily Watson and Rachael Griffiths that give the film its depth.DVD EXTRAS: Nine minute featurette with cast and creative team

$review_text.: I felt this movie had a lot of good points, and equally a number of bad ones. I'll start off with the good. I thought that the special effects were fantastic, particularly the scenes where the ship was sinking. I thought that they got the layout of the ship very accurate, and you could really sense the 'newness', freshness and splendor of this ship on its maiden voyage. It certainly had a feel of 1912 about it.Now the bad points. I felt the love story of Jack and Rose was awful, and highly improbable, particularly for the times. Their dialogue is really poor, and almost cringeworthy at times! The way they act, and talk, just does not ring true for 1912. Also, the mystery ship seen in the distance by officers and passengers, during the sinking, widely believed to be a tramp steamer, called the 'Californian', does not rate a mention in the movie. This is an important part of the 'Titanic' story, that has been omitted.I felt this movie was to a certain extent a wasted opportunity. A Night To Remember, is for me, still the definitive 'Titanic' movie.

$REVIEW.: "Waterworld"  has become a classic of sorts, although some may say for all the wrong reasons.  It received a beating in the year leading up to its release for its bloated budget, a then staggering $200 million.  Much of these costs were incurred due to the shoot being closed down after tropical storms devastated the outdoor sets, and then again when Costner's wife left him during filming, as it was rumored he was caught with some local women and extras.  It was assumed this was going to be a bomb of "Cleopatra" proportions, complete with a bankrupted production company and an embarrassment to Universal Studios.  The film was nicknamed "Fishtar."  However, much to the surprise of everyone, the movie opened to decent reviews and ended up recouping its production costs and turned in a tidy profit with its worldwide gross.  Its various home video releases have also sold very well. The movie inspired a wildly popular ride/attraction at Universal Studios Florida. The movie is not exceptional, as it is essentially "Mad Max" on the water, but it features a strong performance from Costner and a very fun and entertaining turn by Dennis Hopper as "The Deacon", the film's villain.  The action as directed by Kevin Reynolds(The Count of Monte Cristo, Robin Hood:  Prince of Thieves) is no short of spectacular and the dazzling special effects hold up nicely.  For me, the scenes which resonate are those between Costner's Mariner and Helen (Big Love's Jeanne Tripplehorn), and Enola (Napoleon Dynamite's Tina Majorino) on the boat as they become a makeshift nuclear family.  This is where the film should have concentrated more energy as it emerges as the most compelling element of the story.The blu-ray presentation of "Waterworld" is quite excellent.  It has seen many incarnations over the years from VHS and several DVD releases, but this hi-def master is the one to own.  The VC-1 encode is razor sharp, with excellent contrast, and a nice veneer of film grain, giving it a nice theatrical presentation.  There are so many details to catch in the set design and I was able to see many I had not noticed before on the Mariner's boat, the Atoll, and the Valdeez, all of which are exceptionally rendered.  The breathtaking cinematography pops off the screen, the colors having never seen such vibrant imaging. No evidence of DNR (used abusively in past home video releases), aliasing, or edge enhancement.  The film does have some ringing in some scenes, especially aerial shots of the Mariner's sailboat, as the netting gives off too much shimmer, but it's hardly a distraction. Even better is the DTS-HD MA 5.1 lossless soundtrack which beautifully detailed, as we can hear every ripple and wave in the surrounds, and the action, special effects, and explosions rock the listening area with powerful rumbles from the subwoofer. James Newton Howard's brilliant score is rendered with gorgeous clarity and dialogue is crisp, clear and well-prioritized in the center channel.  For fans of the movie, this upgrade is a no-brainer.The special features are nonexistent, only a SD theatrical trailer and BD Live functionality which has nothing to offer.  Most disappointingly, the extended cut of the film is not made available in this set.  Both versions are included in the SD DVD set, but for some reason, Universal did not take advantage of BD's overarching feature...superior capacity and include both versions.  Granted the extended cut is also censored for content as it has been shown on television, but a director-approved cut would have made this release a bit more of an event.Given the bargain price on this one, I say grab it, as fans will love this presentation, but even if you are revisiting the film, it is a different experience away from the hype and bad press, and it is, in the end, a very entertaining and fun action adventure film with terrific special effects, and serves as a nice piece of escapist entertainment.  This blu-ray presentation gives a nice excuse to have another look.

$review_text.: What a beautiful, profoundly touching movie.  The first time I watched it by myself, and I was just blown away by the storyline, the gorgeous setting (it looks like New England), and the outstanding performances from the three main actresses (Sissy Spacek, Alfie Woodard, and Jodelle Ferland).While it raises some pretty tough issues - child abandonment, the foster care system, and Alzheimer's Disease, it does so in a sensitive way.  These issues are not glossed over, but the redemptive power of love works its magic.The second time, I watched the movie with my children (10, 8, 5), and was overjoyed by their compassionate response.  They were completely drawn into the world of Hollis Woods(Ferland), a sullen 12 year old girl with an artistic bent.  They rooted for her and watched her blossom in the company of Josie (Spacek), a lively artist who is slowly succumbing to devastating dementia/Alzheimer's Disease.  They shared Hollis's dawning fear as they realized there was something wrong with Josie, and that she might not be able to take care of Hollis.The movie put a face on some hard truths, but in a hopeful way.  Not everyone has parents who love them.  Some children are unhappy and angry for some pretty profound reasons.  And people we love may lose their memories when they are old.Yet Josie's resilience in the face of her experiences, and her ability to learn to love, and accept love, from the decent and kind people that intersect her life is a great message for kids to carry with them.  Life can be hard, but there are almost always people who are willing to help, if you can reach out to them.  And, a passion for something, such as art and nature, can help you get through dry spells.The story of Josie and Hollis is interlaced with flashbacks to the family Hollis lived with before she moved in with Josie.  Hollis allows herself to fall in love with them, as they joyfully love and welcome her into their family.  But a horrible accident makes things fall apart, and that is when Hollis ends up in Josie's life.Everything comes full circle at the end as Josie's worsening memory/behavior ends up reuniting Hollis with the family that still longs for her to join them.Anyway, my kids and I spent over an hour talking about this substantive and rewarding movie.  And  when it comes out on DVD, it will become part of our collection too.  A++

 I'm happy we were watching it with our 8-year old grandson so we could address his questions at the time


 The good parts were the depiction of the wild west - the bad parts included a recurring theme seen over again  - THE MOVIE IS TOO LONG! and needed better editing

 Some scenes of death were a little too much as he kept on saying - &#34;this is a Disney movie?&#34;.

$review_text.: Initially, I was very hard on Godzilla. I couldn't see it as anything but cheesy and annoying, a true idiot's blockbuster of a film. However, that was before I'd seen what it was based on. The 70's Godzilla movies were cheap and cheerful, oozing with cheese and aimed squarely at kids. So it's no real surprise this big-budget adaptation is a little daft, it's supposed to be.First, the niggly negative points. The story is pants: Godzilla goes to Manhattan, destroys a few things, is killed. The convoluted original movies had thicker plots than that, even if they were totally ludicrous. The cast are the film's biggest letdown, with a hideously poor lineup led by terminal-nice-guy Matthew Broderick, Hank Azaria and various B-List actors. Only Jean Reno is fun to watch, as a French secret agent trying to cover things up.The script is a waste of time. Oozing with cheesy lines and with it's "a stiff breeze would break it" plot, you'll end up not caring who dies or how... in fact, you're mostly likely to care about Godzilla himself.And instead of Godzilla fighting the good fight as once he did, he's merely King Kong here, beating up a few buildings, hiding here and there and getting killed on a landmark. When he dies, so does the movie's only spark.And boy, is Godzilla himself good. Looking awesomely better than he used to, he's a tower of special-effects perfection, complete with original roar and various interesting abilities, such as swimming and fire-breath. He's great fun to watch, but spends far too much of the film in the background. There is simply not enough of him, and we're not really placated with the "Gosh, looks like there's a sequel on the cards" ending.But what the Hell, the film passes the time provided you're in the right mood. Lots of roaring, lots of explosions, a few nifty effects and a few good lines courtesy of Reno. Just bear in mind it's meant to be cheesy, go along with it and it's quite fun.

$REVIEW.: I believe it was former Senator Barney Frank who said on an episode of Real Time With Bill Maher: "What the Gay Community lacks is a real Champion for the Community" and that really struck me.  The Gay Community needs a Martin Luther King, a Malcolm X, a Ghandi.  Someone that will stand up and say louder than anyone has said before, this has got to stop, this is going to stop. Harvey Milk was that powerful of a man, and this film really depicts his rise from one among the commoners to a man with political power.  This movie is very touching and emotional for me, because I feel that if his life hadnt been stolen from him, he would have been the ultimate force that would have brought the people together in a effort to demand full equality for the gay community. This is a film about a Gay Activist and first openly Gay Man to hold political office, but it is not a "gay movie" anyone can watch this movie and enjoy it on several levels.  This movie is based on fact and even has live footage from the era when Milk had to go up against anti-gay sentiment namely Anita Bryant -the footage of her getting that pie in the face was messed up. I understand the anger, but that made me feel bad for the evil wench.  N-E Way, I thought this was a great film.

$review_text.: I originally saw this movie as a boy at the old Rialto Theatre as part of a Saturday afternoon matinee triple bill which also featured Vincent Price's "Last Man on Earth" and Mario Bava's "Nightmare Castle."  I had nightmares about blood lusting ghosts for a week afterwards!  Though I didn't know it then, all three movies would prove to be classics of the genre

 No wonder I was so scared!  Though all three films frightened me, it was Castle of Blood that had the most profound impact.It was the first on the bill


 I didn't even get to see it from the beginning as we were late getting to the cinema and missed the first 20 minutes of the movie

That's lot to miss since the edited print only ran about 79 minutes (the unedited runs 87minutes)

 But despite this, the dark creepy atmosphere (complete with ruined castles, fog enshrouded cemeteries, shadows and cobwebs), Gothic set design, strong acting, and suspense (especially the last 20 minutes) scared the bejeepers out of me and made a lasting impressionIt took me years to finally get a copy of the film for my collection


Since it was a French - Italian import, it wasn't a movie that showed up on the late show in Winnipeg

 I couldn't quite remember the title (remember I didn't get to seen the beginning of the film and was scared witless), and to make matters worse, the film had been released under literally a dozen different movie titles (aka Danze Macabre, Coffin of Terror, Castle of Terror, Long Night of Terror, etc...) and the USA/UK working title "Castle of Blood" was very generic, similar to dozens of other "b" horror and suspense films, making it illusive

 But thanks to the internet and perseverance, I  found it at last!What a treat to finally watch the film in its entirety after so many years!  It may not have had quite the sheer emotional impact that it did when I was a boy, but as haunted house movies go, it's stands up well and compares favourably to similar iconic films of the period such as  "The Haunting," "The Innocents" or "Black Sunday,"The film is a fine early effort of  Italian director Antonio Margheriti


 It stars 60's scream queen icon Barbara Steele and features a well written screenplay by Sergio Corbucci about a sceptical writer (Georges Riviere) who, on a bet, spends the night in haunted house and unsuspectingly becomes part of an annual ongoing ghostly story

 The hypnotic Steele is well cast as the ghostly love interest - as is Arturo Dominici as Dr

Carmus, and Margarete Robsahm as Julia.Many of the tricks Margheriti employs to create the film's eerie atmosphere (cobwebs, creaking doors, fog, etc) are bound to seem clich&eacute; to a modern audience, but they work far more effectively in black and white than they ever could in modern day colour


 Rather than using body counts and special effects, the film creates scares the old fashion way, relying on a good story, stylish direction, fine set production, interesting camera work, and strong acting performances


Margheriti does a marvellous job taking these elements and building the film's suspense as the horrifying paranormal secret of the house gradually reveals itself to the unwitting writer.The film is not without faults

The pace drags at the beginning of the film (ironically, the 20 minutes I originally missed)

This is probably worsened by Synapse films effort to restore the film to its original length

 Though fans will likely appreciate the chance to see the film restored - in terms of the intro - it may have been more of hindrance than a help
 The English voice dubs are merely passable and, in the restored scenes, the language shifts from English to French  (English subtitles provided) which is sure to be annoying to some viewers.However, Synapse Films deserves kudos for the quality of the print

 Clearly some effort was put into its restoration and deservedly so.I enjoyed the film immensely and highly recommend it to aficionados of 60's Italian Goth films, or anyone who enjoys a good ghost story.Rob RheubottomWinnipeg, MB Canada

$review_text.: She was so amazing in her role that during the moments when she was supose to be drugged she seemed so lifeless that you could swear she was dead. I would have given this a five star but I think the story line could of been better written and some of the male actors almost destroyed her performance; maybe it was thier poorly written lines.  Needless to say I think overall it is well worth seeing despite the few male performers.

$REVIEW.: I remember seeing this with only 5 other people in the theater.  No one left until the final credits were over.  It then took almost 2 years to get to home video.  I think this is an amazing film.  Like Gummo, the plot of the film is unimportant.  If you tell people what it is, they'll misunderstand it.  The way the story is told here is what is most important.  Korine is one of the few independent filmmakers out there that is truly independent, in that his films are not for the mainstream.  There is no crossover appeal in julien donkey-boy (or Gummo), and Korine is not interested in it anyway.  This film feels like a poem, or a piece of music, in which the feeling is most important, not a linear timeline.  The whole here is greater than the parts, as opposed to most films, in which there are (sometimes) great setpieces in them, but as a film they're quite often uneven and disjointed.  There are disturbing scenes (wouldn't be Korine if there wasn't), but it all seems to work here.  Wonderful to see Werner Herzog as well.  Excellent film...

$REVIEW.: YES!!! The guys from MST3K are back! I was happy with Mike and the guys doing RiffTrax,but I like this a lot better

It's kinda like MST3k in ways


They have an opening/middle/closing segments, a set, small storyline, and a boss who "provides" the bad film
See with RiffTrax,the majority of the movies they are doing are major studio motion pictures and with the Film Crew they go back to riffing awful B films like they did on MST3K


What a bad movie to do for an introduction to the film crew
This one is very funny and enjoyable

 Ive had it for about a month and have watched it 3 times so far laughing at new jokes I didn't catch before


If you were a fan of the SciFi era of MST3K,this is perfect for you.

$review_text.: the star's career has taken off so much that there are only four episodes in this third season.  however, the high quality continues in each episode.  as usual, he not only has to figure out the mystery and solve it but also survive the plots of those in the department who are after him.  The black policewoman who was after him last season ups the ante this season, trying to recruit his partner as an informer. meanwhile, Luther is busy solving the cases.  Indris Elba who plays Luther is a terrific actor and is now starring in movies as well.  Netflix streaming also carries this series. i love the music in the series too.the humdinger of a story in this series is a vigilante, tom marwood, who is trying to avenge his murdered wife by murdering criminals. although he is initially sympathetic, as tom gets more out of control, he becomes a menace to society in general and Luther in particular. in this episode we also see the return of red haired Alice, who looks out for Luther even though she is a criminal fugitive.  although Luther has a new girlfriend, mary, i frankly can see him with Alice better.there is only one aspect i didn't care for but i suspect it is personal to me and i have put it as a spoiler below.update with POSSIBLE SPOILERS:  one of my frequent readers took me to task about such a short review of Luther.  i commented back that something had bothered me about season three but i could not figure out what it was.  i have now figured it out and i am rather surprised at myself.  what bothers me about this series of Luther is that there is heavy involvement in the cases of two cops doing an internal affairs investigation of him and trying to get him dismissed.  i was a huge fan of Rebus by Ian Rankin.  But I could not stand his new series on an internal affairs cop and stopped reading it. i loved Denzel Washington in TRAINING DAY where he won an Oscar for playing a cop gone bad.  Other than that film, however, I really hate these tv shows about incompetent cops trying to remove someone who is getting the job done.  I absolutely HATED the black woman policeman and the Scot male policeman, who with coarse and heavy handed methods, investigate Luther. i think the moral for me is that i personally am done with internal affairs plotlines. if you are not, this is otherwise up to the excellent standards of the prior two seasons.  in all good conscience, i cannot mark something down because something is hitting my own personal buttons.

$review_text.: Maybe this will appeal to 12 year olds and under, but it's a terrible, trashy, boring piece of horror movie making.  Stephen King's usual ham-handed, broad-brush, uninspired, I'm-so-bored, I'm-so-clever no-surprises writing and plotting, the kind of thing he probably prides himself on knocking off in a day or two--and it really shows.  On paper, King's chatty style can mask the lack of plot or invention--the screen removes the style and the Emperor's new clothes are revealed.  A werewolf is terrorizing a small town, but only little wheelchair-bound Martin knows that it's really the town's minister who has become a werewolf (nobody, including King, knows how--or why he chooses this particular time to begin werewolfing on the side).  The bad guys are really bad, really gross, they get killed immediately, and there is a Halloween night showdown that has almost no suspense or thrills.  Spunky little Martin demands that his alcoholic uncle get a silver bullet made for him so they can kill the creature.  Gary Busey manages not to look embarrassed throughout, a tribute to his acting skills, but "Abbot and Costello Meet the Wolfman" has about twenty times the entertainment value.

$review_text.: This is a unique film that is actually a series of stories about relationships. Most are about individuals starting new relationships with a variety of others such as one ending due to death, one struggling marriage, one rebounding from a broken relationship, two shy stand ins makinga film , a young man frantically searching for a physical relationship, a man in love with his best friend's girl, and a mad mature scene stealing rocker who inserts great humor during his seemingly destructive marketing of his rerecording of a former hit as a Christmas song. All the stories are in fractured bits as the movie leaps from one story to another, each one probably has 20 minutes of actual film time that you seem to see in two to four minute bursts, which seem to get longer as each reach their climax at the end. There are three sad stories, two of which seem to rebound but the saddest is a young woman played by Laura Linney who takes tremendous responsibility for her mental health impaired brother while pursuing a handsome yet seemingly socially limited co-worker who cannot contemplate her dedication for her dependent brother. There is a lot of humor interspersed throughout and my favorite story was Hugh Grant playing the Prime Minister trying to refuse the sweet and innocent but earthy charms of a lovely big boned assistant played wonderfully by Martine McCutcheon. The PM story takes a zing at America by posing the President as a creepy, dominating womanizer but since Billy Bob Thornton played it rather creepily, you don't empathize with the character. My favorite single character is the ex-bad boy rocker Billy Mack played very believably by Bill Nighy. His outrageous attempts to promote his song, while also insulting it, and making flippant remarks such as, "Kids don't buy drugs.........wait until you are a rock star and they will give them to you for free!" are delightfully fun breaks from the other stories.  On the most part, the stories end happily with only one that totally crashes so it is a mostly upbeat entertaining film. The number of great actors playing in this film is stunning, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Colin Firth (with an amazing proposal) Liam Nielsen, beautiful Keira Knightly (hard to believe she was the tom boy in "Bend it Like Beckham) and Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean) in two wonderful cameo roles as a dry incredulously proper and proficient jewelry salesman ("In the flashest of flash"). Interspersed throughout is a great soundtrack with hits from the Pointer sisters, Nora Jones, Kelly Clarkson (soulful), Maroon 5, Otis Redding, Olivia Olson ("All I want for Christmas" is outstanding and she is 10?), Lynden David Hall (fantastic version of "All You Need is Love"), Beach Boys ("God Only Knows", which seems perfect for the ending showcasing those that end on a positive note) and the Billy Mack song "Christmas is all Around" is a hoot and is actually very entertaining and catchy although its played up as a bit of a farce. Virtually a good romantic comedy interspersed with some touching, sad and real stories but overall leaves you with hope for the few that end with a struggle and happiness for those that make it.

$REVIEW.: After having to endure the self-aware horror movies that have plagued us since Scream's release it's very refreshing to see some innovation on the part of New Line to take a risk on a film that has no real antogonist and spares us the happy ending.  Devon Sawa (Idle Hands) plays Alex, a high school student on a class trip to Paris who after having a premonition that the plane's going to crash gets off along with a handful of his unwilling classmates.  When the plane actually does crash, he finds himself under suspicion by the FBI, a suspicion which grows more intense as the rest of the departed students wind up dying off one by one.  The first half hour consists of one of the best plane crashes ever caught on film and some pretty spooky stuff that allows the tension to mount until Death pays them a visit.  It's a clever spin on a movie that was originally concieved of as being your typical slasher film but thanks to X-File alum James Wong and co-scibes Glen Morgan &amp; Jeffrey Reddick averts that all-too-beaten path.  Some of the typical beheads, what-have-you plague a story that should be above that kind of stuff but it's what the kids like and with today's special effects even the most overdone scenes can be flipped on their ears.  The DVD offers up an alternate ending that'll have you thanking your lucky stars that they chose the one that they did and some deleted scenes, which are mildly interesting.  Maybe the best new feature are the interactive games that will test your psychic ability and even predict the date of your death.

If your into deep thinking because your life revolves around the dream world of gay love and drug use, you will love this 60's drama.  Personally, I am glad I only rented this "deep movie" of two gay lovers whose "rhymes"  would only make sense if you were high. On the positive side, while the story and the "xxx?" historical poem, and Ginsberg's life story with its center point being a nothing rambling poem, had its 15 minutes of fame, it left me cold. The animation did much to try and save the value of the movie and added some clarity to the verses.  However, save your money and get clean. LOL

$review_text.: The story was cute, showed the characters tip-toeing into adolescence.There was more swearing, which was unnecessary, and almost abrasive.Part of the humor & charm of the original was the point that they didn't actually swear (&#34;except I didn't say 'fudge'&#34;).Having the original cast would have been ideal for this movie, because it's so well-known.These were the distracting details for me:Ralphie's hair was practically yellow on camera.Ralph's dad played the role like Fred Flintstone. Did he play that role simultaneously?It was hard watching other actors play their roles, because it was evident that they were trying hard to mimic the original cast.It looked like this cast was stage acting for an audience.Trying to age the characters and morph the actors requires a lot of adjustment for the audience.So why not let them be a completely new family, maybe the family next door?Plan to be disappointed in some ways, but pleased by the nice ending.

$REVIEW.: I had wanted to see what Sarah Roemer would do next as she has a nice screen presence so I made sure to get a couple of these for the store...oops. I still like her but I suppose everyone has to have a stinker early in their career.The story follows a young NY man/nursing student who loses his dad to a handball game (literally) so the family has to get odd jobs to keep the family home. His job ends up being a door man working for a strict boss (played well by Pantoliano), a mellow coworker played by Snoop, and the token beautiful trust-fund daughter/resident of the building played by Roemer. Through several painful script setups our two characters court and find love. The strength of this would be the NYC footage, both day and night. Pantoliano is always fun to watch, and Snoop was very believable - he showed off his character better than anyone else in the film. The writing felt forced, and the scenes kept getting more contrived as the film played on - it was actually a relief for them to end it.The 2.0 sound is poorly done and the picture is average quality. The supplement is a music video/picture montage of them making the film, lasts a couple minutes - completely forgettable. Cannot classify this as a romantic comedy as there is maybe one laugh, but I suppose if you are looking for a light, escapist NYC romantic film - you will not be too disappointed. Three stars for Pants, Snoop and NYC, zero for the rest. Recommend seeing Roemer inFired Up (Unrated Edition) [Blu-ray], she was a lot more fun in that one. Enjoy.

$review_text.: I can't believe that Leonard Maltin only gave this movie Two Stars! He said (I Paraphrase) "Decent cast can't save this pedestiran script." He also goes on to write how the movie sat on the shelf for two years. He is right. I noticed the copyright on the DVD box was 1993 while at the end credits they said 1991. According to Wikipedia the movie was released on September 11, 1991 (More On That Later) This movie really did it for me.Ironic, because it is a movie that I would never have purchased had I not by chance ssen it advertised on the back end of an old VHS tape. I bought the movie a couple of years ago and saw it on last night. The opening sequence did it all for me. That is where all of the principle characters were introduced in a six degrees of separation sequence where they literally walk or drive by one another within the space of minutes. Unbeknownst to each other, they will strike up a lifelong friendship that goes through many trying times.I won't go through each character's situation, save to say that they are broken down into wealthy, upper-middle class, and middle class households. I cared for the characters and while Cybill Sheppard's character was a bit vacuous, even she grew on me at the end. I couldn't help but lament the loss of the World Trade Center as the Twin Towers are shown majestically from what I believe is Staten Island (Please Feel Free To Comment If I'm Mistaken) where the ladies are having their get together mid-way through the movie.This is certainly a movie I recommend to lovers of romantic comedies. The movies most hilarious moment comes when the kids of John and Iris Morden ask them if they ever "dropped acid." They turn to their kids with "shock" and say, "No, we never did drugs in our lives!" I laughed so hard I almost had tears. Not that they said it, but that it was said with a straight face!Buy this movie or rent it. It's one of Hiller's best, despite what the critics said about it.A.

$REVIEW.: I know mine is a minority view, but I found the editing, score and narration-all of which were designed to make the human viewer identify with and root for the struggling penguins-to be rather sappy, and to undermine the power of the amazing footage of these remote creatures.  The fact that they walk on two feet lends to easy anthropomorphism, and the filmmakers push that at every opportunity.  Make no mistake-the images are remarkable, as are the facts of the penguin mating march.  I just wish that the filmmakers didn't feel it necessary to dress it up as a human love story.

$REVIEW.: The finale for this show is really bad. It totally unbalances what took many years for this show to keep balanced. We are really expected to believe that Will and Grace stopped being friends for a few years? Come on! Every episode of this show was about how their bond became stronger. And Jack and Karen ending up together? Oh, please! This finale keeps jumping around to different events in their lifetimes. And Vince and Will together? I can't stand Vince! This finale was a total bomb. I gave it 2 stars because of Karen's amazing singing voice near the end.

$REVIEW.: I thought "Citizen Kane" was well acted and well written and produced.  It is a glimpse into the life of "a big American", as Thompson's boss Rawlston pointed out, but ultimately it is a story of how consumed we can become by our own demons if we allow them to overtake us.  Kane could be seen as a hypocrite--championing the workingman and fighting for his interests, while at the same time employing the tactics of those he rails against (the rich, privileged, and powerful).  But at heart, he is just a man looking for love and acceptance (from friends, family--particularly his mother, who sent him away at 10 years of age--and the people).  And because it never works out for him, he takes his losses in the most personal way, until finally he is consumed by it and it takes its toll on him (symbolized by the Rosebud sled being consumed once and for all by the flames of the furnace).  Rosebud was, indeed, something he lost--his link to his childhood and it would forever have an impact on him.We had to watch this movie for an English class in college, and I've been intrigued by it ever since--perhaps because, deep down, there's a little Charlie Kane in all of us.

$REVIEW.: Most of the computer-animated films since Toy Story have been funny enough for adults to enjoy as much as kids, and Chicken Little is no exception.  It's not one of the best, but I liked it better than Madagascar, earlier this year.  Compared to Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc., Shrek, and Ice Age, this one was not quite as consistently funny, though very cute.  However, it added some sci-fi special effects particularly suited to CGI.  There's a piece of the sky - it really turns out to be a piece of something else - that projects an image from one side that's identical to what's behind it, making it effectively invisible, a gimmick I've read about a few years ago in a sci-fi story about nano-technology in Analog magazine.  The CGI effects make this sequence of Chicken Little one of the most amazing of any movie out this year.  Just for laughs, however, Wallace and Grommit and the Curse of the Wear Rabbit, which used traditional stop-motion animation, was a bit funnier.
$review_summary.: Not the funniest, but great new animation.

Once they have listened to her interviews and scene commentaries on this DVD, they will know that she is also a very intelligent, kind, and unassuming woman.Plenty has been said about the movie, which I liked very much, but not enough to keep it.  The DVD is loaded with nice extras including: director's commentary, specific scene commentary by principle actors, quite a few deleted scenes (most of which are very interesting), a well done 'making of' documentary, and interesting interviews with Diane, Richard, and Olivier.Definitely worth checking out.

$REVIEW.: This workout is an athletic approach to yoga, but it's still straight up yoga poses
Every part of the workout is focused on a different area , you start with 15 minutes of sun salutations A & B, then you focus on your legs with some lunges and chair variations then you work your upper body with a series of push up , cobra , and down dog variations and then you work your abs , Adrienne , the instructor makes you work real good & you'll definitely feel your muscles burning and work up sweat.At the end there's some stretches and relaxation

Also there's a seperate savasana segment which is 10 minute approx

and you can do it if the relaxation of the workout wasn't enough.The workout is 60 minutes + the savasana = 70 min.The production and video quality are really good and there's a nice background music

The only thing that disappointed me is that there were no advanced yoga poses like she demonsrates on the cover, but never mind , it was challenging enough.

$REVIEW.: While I'm always up for a good spoof, I was hoping for a bit more from the film Frog-G-G! (2004), which did have its charms, but not to the point where I'd watch it again anytime soon.  Written, directed, and produced by Cody Jarrett (Surfbroads, Sugar Boxx), the film stars Kristi Russell (Chasing Indigo, Surfbroads), an actress who doesn't seem to mind showing some skin (she's got a great rack), as it were, at least in terms of this film, which is the only feature I've ever seen her in...also appearing is Ariadne Shaffer (Beneath the Mississippi), Robert Patrick Brink (The Perfect Wife), Michael McConnohie, primarily known, it seems, for his voice over work on such video games as those in the Xenosaga series, and Mary Woronov (Rock 'n' Roll High School, Eating Raoul).After a somewhat pointless opening picnic sequence (a kid finds a bowling ball sized tadpole in a nearby pond) we move into the opening credits to which we see two nekkid women getting it on...kind of, if you consider `getting it on' to consist of a whole lot of licking...turns out one of them is Dr. Barbara Michaels (Russell), while the other is her slightly butch girlfriend named Trixie (Shaffer).  Seems Michaels, an agent for the EPA, has come to Jerkwater, U.S.A. to investigate complaints of polluted water, which I'm guessing is ultimately the cause of the ginormous tadpole we saw earlier.  Her investigations eventually lead her to a nearby company called Grimes Chemicals, run by an overly hostile man named Huntley Grimes (McConnohie), who, in fact, is responsible given the fact he's been ordering some of his flunkie workers to bury toxic byproducts in a nearby field.  Here are a few tips for those irresponsible manufacturers looking to skirt the laws by illegally dumping their manufacturing wastes...1. Ensure your company's name isn't plastered across the 55-gallon drums in which the toxic waste to be illegally dumped is stored.2. It's probably best not to have the guys hauling the toxic waste to be illegally dumped doing so in a company truck, with the company's name on the side.3. It's probably best not to have the guys doing the dumping to be wearing t-shirts with the company name clearly printed on the front.Anyway, as I mentioned, Michaels investigation eventually leads her to Grimes Chemical, but she soon hit a roadblock (figuratively speaking) as the local sheriff, a man named Buford Lawson (Brink), has ties to the chemical company owner.  As a major health crisis begins to develop (some people are becoming ill from exposure), Michaels has her research stolen, but not before she manages to send off some samples to the home office for further tests.  Eventually things get a whole lot goofy as frog man begins popping up around town, one who seems only interested in mating with female humans, and eventually things come to a head once the amphibious humanoid makes his appearance at a local high school football game, one the whole town is attending.Now in watching this film, it was fairly obvious to me it was intended as a spoof of the low budget, schlocky creature features shown throughout the 1970s, so, given this, I'm guessing most of that which I'd normally consider bad here (the acting, the story, the dialogue) to be bad intentionally so...given that, my biggest gripe about the movie is that there isn't more of the frog creature in it...he doesn't appear until well into the story, and even then his appearances are limited.  He does make a good showing in the last ten minutes but by then it felt like too little, too late.  The frog suit isn't particularly convincing (it truly looks like a guy in a frog suit), but again, I think this was another aspect that was meant to come off as did, so I went with it.  Another element of the production I though could have used a little work was the pacing.  Director Jarrett seems more interested, at times, in filming the lesbian scenes than he did furthering the plot, although I can't blame him all that much as the women were attractive.  There is some nekkidness but hardly any blood as there's only one scene where someone actually gets killed by the frog man (there's actually two frog related deaths in the film).  The production values (except for the frog suit) are decent enough for an independent feature like this, so no complaints from me there.  The funniest bit, for me at least, comes near the end as the frog man shows up at the local football game.  While the game is being played the frog man appears on the field and clotheslines a receiver, which elicited the following response from one of the coaches..."He's not on my team!"It would have been funnier if the filmmakers had extended the scene slightly in showing a referee calling a foul on the play, but oh well.  If you're checking this out mainly because you saw Mary Woronov's name prominently listed on the DVD case, known that she's only in the movie for about two minutes near the end, featured in a very small, bit part.  It's annoying when filmmakers promote a recognizable name appearing in their films as being a much larger part of the production than they are (as was the case here), but it's a fairly common practice, especially in the world of low budget movies.  All in all I thought this a somewhat entertaining film and a great effort, but it could have used a few more gags (especially if it was supposed to be a spoof), better pacing, and a lot more frog, in my humble opinion.The DVD, released by a company called Vital Fluids Releasing, features a widescreen anamorphic (1.85:1) picture that looks very good and the Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo audio comes through cleanly.  There are a couple of extras including a humorous trailer for the film made to look like public service announcement and a featurette entitled `Making of Frog-G-G!' which is comprised of interviews, deleted scenes, and behind the scenes footage.  Also tossed in are a few previews for some independent features like Ball of Wax (2003), Ding-a-ling-Less (2001), and Horns and Halos (2002).Cookieman108

$review_text.: The third return of this amazing ensemble cast unfortunately this season had it's ups and down for me more down especially when the writers completely disregarded important points mentioned in previous season and acted as if it never happened. The thing is when Glee does a good episode it does it amazing same goes for song choices. Take Mash Off that episode had some of the best songs of the seasons especially the Rumour Has It/Someone Like You mash up. For best episode came down to 2 for me Choke dealing with domestic abuse and using Shake It Out as means to show Coach Bieste abuse was powerful and then there was the suicide attempt of Dave Karofsky in On My Way which was highlighted with the song Cough Syrup and in dedication Stronger. With Glee this season for every good episode we got 2-3 not so good one but like I said the good ones keeps pulling me back to continue watching.Still recommend for the unpopular and even the popular teen/adult whoever cause we all can learn from some of the lessons implemented in the really good episodes of the show.

$REVIEW.: This movie has and is a daring story. The story in the movie and the story of the woman, who dared to make this movie, and who after the fact, was the target of death threats etc.  In this movie the taboo of love between two women is very powerfully depicted. Yet I would say more importantly it is the social system and the family system within India that is being opened up to the moviegoers. India is the "case study" here yet the realities of these relations are present at other places all over the Middle East. So this movie makes a very powerful statement and remains a beautiful, in many senses a classical yet so out of the ordinary love-story.

However, this is one of the few chick-flicks I like.  Eventhough you know Kevin Klien is a total American, he does a great job of being a French thief.  And for what?  It turns out he just wants to have his own winery in the French country side.  This happens to be one of my dreams.

$REVIEW.: Clearly this set will only interest you if you liked the series in the first place -- and it's certainly a nice warm bath of nostalgia for those of us who loved it, even if, as an adult, the plots are pretty weak and the 2490s look painfully like the 1970s.  (Then again, who's to say they won't?)My one complaint is that there are no special features:  no "making of" shorts, no commentary tracks, no deleted scenes, nothing.For example:  Disk #1 starts with the theatrical release movie, not the TV pilot.  The TV version had a few extra scenes, such as a segue that set up the ongoing series (including premises that are referenced in later episodes).  It would have been nice to have those scenes tacked onto the end as an option.The Battlestar Galactica boxed set managed to include things like this, even whole subplots that got left on the cutting room floor.  Presumably Buck Rogers' cult following is too small and it wasn't worth the effort and expense.  Still, would've been nice.
$SUMMARY.: Alas, no added features

I kept hoping for Fred Krueger to pop out of the dark corners and corridors to liven the action or story somewhat...What's disturbing is the b rated acting style and poorly written dialogue of Fear dot com. What is it with pulling dead bodies out of water (The Ring)only to discover that the corpses want something else other than a nice burial and a moving eulogy ?!...Death by computer/internet is not an original idea either...The plot (if you can call it that) involves two investigators trying to solve the mysterious deaths of four people after visiting a website. What is the connection between the fear.com website and the people who die after entering it ? In addition, the [person] who runs the site is a demented murderous fiend known as The Doctor who "can't feel anything"--void of emotions like the acting...He tortures his victims and murders them live on the web. The two detectives must also find him before time runs out...Save your dinero and skip it !

That pope wasn't one in reality too. he didn't speak up though and he's been condemned ever since. This one does show that the pope had some what he thought were good reasons for not doing so. He never collaborated with hitler and that's a fact. He could have done alot more but then the allies didn't even bomb the railroad tracks to the death camps. At least the pope was a good man , who did not enough perhaps but he did try to help the jews of rome at least. The film looks great and features many jewish characters as well as the pope. In fact it treats the jewish people pretty well. It's worth watching and owning. the picture is great too as this is a new movie.

$review_text.: I came across this film both because I have been watching a lot of early talkie films and because many people swear it is better than Grand Hotel, a better known classic.  While it is certainly well done for a film of this vintage (released July 1932), I did not think it quite matched the level of sophistication of either Grand Hotel or a later film from the same year, Ernst Lubitsch's Trouble in Paradise.  And it certainly doesn't match up for star power.  While it deals frankly with topics like marital infidelity, it also lacks the raciness of other pre-code films like Red Headed Woman or Three on a Match.  That said, this is still a must see for fans of early cinema.  Warren William, forgotten today but a major star of early talkie cinema, gives a fascinating performance as a scheming bank executive; he reminded me of a lot of people I've worked with in the past.  His final scenes, in particular, give an enormously enlightening look into the perverse mindset which prevails amongst such people to this day.  And 21 year old Maureen O'Sullivan (Tarzan series, The Thin Man) is a pure and refreshing delight in every one of her scenes.  Anita Page, on the other hand, looks awkward and aged well beyond her 21 years (perhaps too much Hollywood living).  Finally, unlike the other Forbidden Hollywood DVDs, Leonard Maltin did not grace this one with any introduction.  As for all the films in this series, a DVD set is long overdue.

I read every credit in &#34;re-amazement&#34;.  SO much talent went into the creation of this superb movie, based on the folk-tales of Sholem Aleichem.  I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.  Even through the difficult sections containing confrontation between the villagers and the &#34;Russian Administrators&#34;, it remains a story for all time, very much like Les Mis. It is a human story about the right of people to simply exist, told with irony, humor, romanticism and even some hard truth.

This dvds are not for the fate at heart


The instructors go very fast and at times I get lost with all the step aerobics but i do sweat a lot trying to keep up


 I like the MaxCardio Burn dvd the best.The only con is all the props used during the work
I dislike having to switch out the bar to the hard weights to the steps.

$review_text.: This story is not the typical Superman tale that I grew up to know.  This movie shows the man of steel as an outcast in the beginning.  He saved many lives dressed as a normal kid and (later) man and became an Urban Legend.  He did not emerge as Clark Kent until the last scene of the movie, after he eliminated a &#34;Worldly Threat&#34; from General Zahn and his cronies.

$REVIEW.: and still not make a delicious cake.  I know I'm in trouble when I start looking at the time readout on the DVD, mentally calculating how much longer a film is.  That started for me about halfway into this project.  I knew about Page and Edge of course, had heard of Jack but knew little about him.  I now know he's a very odd, self-important duck, almost a parody of ... well of someone trying to play Jack White.  Page is somewhat reflective and plays some licks, Edge is either really self-effacing or has almost no personality - and it was frustrating to just keep hearing how much he loved effects, and how many effects he had, and how he could combine them, OK I get it.  But can you play?  That is never really answered in the film.When the 3 of them come together on the soundstage, once again there's plenty of kindling but it never catches fire.  Just an old bloke, a middle aged bloke and a young 'un who has decided he's not going to be awed by the others and just act like he's their equal.  Odd song selections and really no playing to speak of.  All in all, this might have been an interesting 30 minute short but does not have the weight necessary to justify its length.  Rent don't buy, if you think you're interested.

$REVIEW.: This was pretty good. I only watched it because someone else recommended it. When I saw the trailers when it first came out, I thought it would be sleazy -- kinda like a cross between &quot;Cocktail&quot; and &quot;Showgirls&quot;. Turns out, it is not like that. Yes, it does take place in a bar where girls dance, but you do not see any flesh (at least not more than you see on the nightly news, but nothing bared). It is a good story about a girl fighting for her dreams against the odds, the ups and downs and it ends formulaicly happy, but that is what most of us want anyhow. A good date movie, a good family movie (teens), kinda mellow, good music.

$review_text.: The fourth season of Voyager is the first truly great season of the show. Upon rewatching the series, I was pleasantly surprised at how well the first three seasons held up. My memories were of a rather poor show that miraculously improved halfway through its run. What I found, though, was that the first seasons were not bad, but they were uneven. Many good episodes, a few great ones, and a handful of terrible ones. Rewatching the series revealed that the show had promise but took a while to reach the level it was capable of. In their fourth season, though, they fulfilled that promise.Subtracting Kes, whose character arc had become unfocused, and adding Seven of Nine turned out to be a masterstroke. Yes, Seven brought a more blatant sex appeal than Kes, but she also brought a new perspective to the show and new possibilities. Her character was like a shot in the arm to the series, and the quality of the writing improved as well (as did Captain Janeway's hairstyle). Thrilling two-parters like "The Year of Hell," personal crises as in "Mortal Coil," and emotionally charged moments as in the closing scene of "Message in a Bottle" add up to a remarkable, wonderful season.Voyager was a great show, and this season is the first to really prove it, from start to finish.

$REVIEW.: I am not going to go into details about what stories are in this series or what I like or don't like about the packaging as I am sure you have read it all in the many other reviews.What I will say, is that as one who loves to collect old television as well as animated series, I think this is one of the best Saturday shows ever released on television


 Funny then, that as a kid I never watched it

 Why?  Because this program, with it's outstanding story-lines was actually a show that was written and produced for adults
 With some of the best science fiction writers in the world, as well as the writers, producers, directors, and cast from the original series, this was not a show created for morning laughs and actually requires you to pay attention to it in order to follow along.I have to admit that I was never a big fan of Star Trek when it originally aired and probably never watched an episode of it until the late 70's when I was in the Navy
 I truly never became interested in it until the first movie was released
 With that admission, I must now say that since that time I have become a huge fan of the original series, and along with those three seasons, this fits quite nicely into what could be considered season four
 The DVD set also includes over 3 hours of bonus material which is a great plus, and it is reasonably priced.I saw a couple of episodes of the animated series for the first time a year or two ago when I saw them online and have wanted this collection ever since

 If you have never seen them, give this set a shot


 You won't be disappointed.

$REVIEW.: Robert Taylor was nearing the end of his trail when he made Return of The Gunfighter, but it is a solid, decent western.Taylor plays Ben Wyatt, a legendary gunfighter just out of prison after serving time for a killing that he did not commit. He is sent for by an old friend who is being harassed into giving up his land. By the time Wyatt makes it to his friend's house, his friend and his friend's wife are dead, and their daughter is in hiding. Taylor takes it upon himself to protect the daughter and avenge his friend's murder.Lyle Bettger is his usually despicable self playing the villain, and Chad Everett provides fine support as Bettger's brother, who crossed paths with Wyatt without knowing that Wyatt is after his brother.Return of the Gunfighter is not spectacular, but it is enjoyable on its own merits.

$review_text.: Warner Bros. production of "Virginia City", has often come in for its fair share of criticism over its smaller budget than other contemporary westerns had lavished on them at this time and of the classic cases of miscasting among some of the lead performers. I for one always enjoy it and find that while it isn't anywhere near Errol Flynn's greatest role it is one where he delivers an interesting performance which can be counted among his better efforts. It is an interesting point that Errol Flynn was one of, if not the only non-American ever to find success in the western genre as evidenced by his great work in such efforts as "Dodge City", "Silver River", and in this effort.Directed with the usual gusto by director Michael Curtiz who despite detesting Flynn personally always managed to extract fine work from him, "Virginia City" has an involved and indeed complicated story placed in the period of the American Civil war. It tells the story (based on an actual incident), of Captain Kerry Bradford (Flynn) a "yankee" who after escaping from a southern prison is sent south to Virginia City to hinder an essential shipment of $5,000,000 worth of gold secretly gathered by southern sympathisers from reaching the south's  base of defence without which the war effort cannot be continued. Along the way he locks horns in a battle of wits with former goaler Captain Vance Lurby (Randolph Scott) who is determined to see that this secret shipment goes through via wagon train to Richmond to aid the cause. Also complicating Bradford's orders is the alluring dance hall singer come confederate spy Julia Hayne/Julie Adams (Miriam Hopkins) with whom he promtly falls in love and finds himself in a dilemma of mixed loyalties. Much attention has been focused on the miscasting of Miriam Hopkins in this role that perhaps required a more "sassy" type of female in the role. Hopkins always a fine actress as can be seen by her sterling work in "The Old Maid", "These Three", and "Old Acquaintance" does good work here despite being in a role not entirely suited to her screen persona. Her work in the trek on the wagon train and in particular during the spectacular attack on the wagon trains in the conclusion is excellent and goes some way toward improving her role and giving her some dramatic potential from the earlier largely unsatisfactory dance hall scenes where she does appear out of place. Humphrey Bogart also appears in the film as the villian of the piece half breed Mexican John Murrell who is determined to get his hands on this shipment of gold by fair means or foul. He is badly miscast here playing a Mexican bandito and in 1940 was only just pulling himself out of the second string villian roles which were his forte during the 1930's. He obviously still had little say in the choice of his roles which would change very quickly after his wonderful performances in films like "The Maltese Falcon". Flynn "sidekicks", Alan Hale and Guinn "Big Boy" Williams round out the cast and bring some humour to their roles as Bradford loyal friends who seem to just turn up when he most needs their support. Their easy rapport with Errol Flynn is a strong point of the film and is a real pleasure to see in "Virginia City",  based no doubt on the fact that they worked more often with Errol Flynn on screen than with anyone else."Virginia City", an "A" class production for 1940 benefits greatly from some beautiful location photography and the camerawork and staging in particular around the scenes of the wagon train attack cannot be bettered. Perhaps this type of film cries out for technicolour which had been used to such great effect in Errol Flynn's western effort of the previous year "Dodge City", however it is still effective in the beautiful shades of black and white photography. The obvious care and attention to detail are very evident here and they are the elements that lift this film up a notch or two above your average western of the time. Indeed no Errol Flynn film in this period could ever be classed as average as he was one of Warner Bros top Box Office stars and his films brought in guaranteed fortunes upon release."Virginia City" with its off beat casting, unusual conclusion which I wont give away for the benefit of those who haven't seen it yet, and the chance to see Errol Flynn ideally cast in his absolute prime, has indeed much to recommend it as entertainment from this period. Not the best western ever made but still a well put together production which despite its flaws makes great viewing. Enjoy Errol Flynn and Miriam Hopkins in their only performance together in Warner Bros. "Virginia City".

$review_text.: Recently we went to see I Am Legend.Based on a novel which I believe is of the same name, it tells the tale of a military doctor who is one of the few survivors of a plague, which has wiped out most of humanity, and turned most of the rest of the population into a pack of ravenous but daylight-fearing zombies
The doctor's manic mission is to find a cure for plague
He is on his own, except for his trusted dog, left behind by his family when they fled New York.The doctor is played by Will Smith, and he has to carry most of the movie on his own

And carry it he does
He could have been manic or over-the-top, but he kept things reserved, showing the quiet warping of personality associated with imposed isolation for years.The film isn't perfect
The zombies are too McGuffin-like, and the film feels a little shorter than it should have been as a result
Nevertheless, the movie was enjoyable, and provided some good scares too.

It takes more guts to try to love again than it does to throw in the towel. The trick is to know when the possibility of love is staring you right in the face - funny because it's the heart that love stares into.I didn't like the ending, but I won't spoil it here for you.

$REVIEW.: We recently had re-editions of the two Predator movies and the unbelievable Alien Quadrilogy collection

These new versions or editions tried to prepare the audiences for what promised to be a match to remember, Alien vs

Predator.Unfortunately, the movie did not fulfill the expectations of the fans of the two alien creatures, but on the bright side it was more interesting and less campy than the previous crossover of Freddy vs


Jason
The film has some interesting points in the story but it takes too many liberties with the origin and purposes of the two main characters
The movie begins with Weyland enterprises (the same company who sends Ripley and her team to space on the first three alien films) assembling a team of specialists for a special mission to Antarctica, an interesting fact is that Mr


Charles Bishop Weyland is the same actor (Lance Henriksen) who played the characters of Bishop and Bishop II in the Alien series, which helps make the relation that he was the template for the droids.From then on, the story loses direction every passing moment, a pyramid was found in Antarctica and they must research why is it there and who built it
The answer? Predators built it so they could have fun hunting Aliens every 100 years

The team gets trapped in the middle of a pyramid filled with Aliens and Predators fighting each other.There are however some memorable sequences, the first encounter between the two creatures is just incredible, and even though the Predator ends up being the sidekick of specialist Alexa Woods (Saana Lathan), seeing the two alien species fighting each other is worth the movie


Even though the ending is basically the same stuff we already saw in Predator 2, the writer tried to give it a twist to let the door open for a sequel

I did enjoy this film because of the fighting and the visuals, but I have mixed feelings at the moment of deciding if the movie was good or not, I dare to say it is more of a visual feast than good storytelling and well, I kinda liked it.

$REVIEW.: "The Menagerie" is a unique chapter in Trek history. Unable to deliver new episodes quickly enough (due to Trek's exceptionally long postproduction times in those days), the producers wrote a 2-part episode based largely around the original pilot for the show, which NBC had rejected. The newer scenes are mostly simple set-ups aboard ship or a starbase.The story-telling device is ingenious. Spock was the only crew member to carry over from the original cast. In Part I of "The Menagerie," Spock hijacks the Enterprise to take his old captain, Christopher Pike, back to planet Talos IV. In the resulting mutiny trial, images are beamed from the planet. This footage is actually reused from the original Star Trek pilot, "The Cage."The resulting two-part story is an award-winning masterpiece. Roddenberry was fond of his original pilot and liked to show it by itself. But a great deal is gained by the framing device, or "envelope." (Note that there is little "Cage" footage that did not get reused in "The Menagerie" -- just a couple of brief scenes.) By seeing old and new Enterprise footage side by side, we get a sense of Federation history and continuity. There are some cosmetic changes, which would be natural, but it's basically the same ship. We see how deep the quality of loyalty is in Spock. Normally Spock's loyalty is to Kirk, but Spock's loyalty to his old captain -- also an Earthman -- in my opinion makes Spock all the more admirable.We also get to see Kirk and Pike side by side. These are similar men, both bold decisive leaders on the young side of 40. But Jefferey Hunter (whose other major role was Jesus) brought less of a sense of humor to Captain Pike than Shatner often did with Kirk."The Cage" itself, which makes up the bulk of Part II, is quite good. The big-brained Talosians captured Pike and sought to make him mate and settle down with an Earth woman, Vina (the delightful Susan Oliver). When they see that human hatred of captivity -- as demonstrated by Pike -- is too great, they realize that humans aren't useful to them and they let him go. Using the power of illusion, they offered many enticements. The scene in which they make Vina appear as a green Orion slave girl is the sexiest in all of Star Trek, and it's worth the money for that scene alone.The final scene (back on the current Enterprise) is one of the most moving in the history of the franchise. As the credits roll, we see Kirk gaze in awe as he sees the Talosians use their mental powers to restore the severely-disabled Pike to a full and joyful life. "He has illusion and you have reality." It is a very humane ending that helps to make up for the Talosians' earlier bad behavior.

$review_text.: This is a good and funny movie-although I didnt see it that way at first but thats a different story-about a family who live in in a bomb shelter for thirty years and the girl the son meets when he goes up to get food supplies on earth. Its very funny in case I havent already said that and you should get it. I did once I changed my mind about it because I didnt want to see it at first. But like I said thats a different story. Which if you really want to know I got got dragged to The Truman Show by my parents-especially my mom- which at least in my opion is one of the dumbest movies ever so I wasnt about to fall for it twice and finally got my way and stayed home. They came home Singing praises about it. It was only when mom rented it that I saw it and changed my mind. I later bought it and you should too in case I* havent already mentioned it.

$REVIEW.: First, I want to say 'Bravo' to the orchestra and Maestro Pappano. The orchestra played vivid in color and very dramatic. I have noticed the conductor recently, desperately passionate in music, especially in the style of Romantic, especially with Italian operas.Ms. Gheorghiu is a powerhouse. Her vibrato is very intense and she is very good on dramatic scenes. Though, I found her acting reminds me some old fashion stars from before (maybe I am wrong). Her voice kind remind me Callas in it's intensities.I think it is worth to have this DVD as an alternative for 'real' opera version.

$REVIEW.: It has a talented director, a brilliant cast,and an intriguing premise about a man who discovers that his dead wife was unfaithful.And despite all that, "The Other Man" ends up flopping face-first on the ground, with some deeply sloppy direction and a middle section that is pure wheel-spinning. One of the major problems is that it  is a good hour too long for its content, which forces Liam Neeson to wander around looking tortured for long periods of time. He's good at that, but not good enough.Software engineer Peter (Liam Neeson) and shoe designer Lisa (Laura Linney) seem to have the perfect marriage. But after she dies, he finds clues that she may have had a lover -- e-mails, voice-mails, and a cryptic note that just says "Lake Como." This discovery throws him into a rage, and he becomes determined to track down and kill her lover.If you're hoping for "Taken 3," be disappointed. He does track down her lover in Milan, a cosmopolitan Spaniard named Ralph (Antonio Banderas) -- and the two men strike up what Ralph thinks is a friendship, playing chess every day at a cafe. As they play, Ralph describes the decade-long love affair with Lisa, and Peter's desire for revenge slowly grows. But is Ralph what he appears?Richard Eyre is actually a very talented director -- he's made movies like "Notes for a Scandal," "Iris" and two episodes of "The Hollow Crown." But something in "The Other Man" has gone completely wrong. Perhaps it's that it feels more like a stage play than a movie, since a good chunk of the narrative is just two men sitting at a table, talking about the women they've both slept with. But "My Dinner With Andre," this ain't.And at times, Eyre's direction feels sloppy and awkward. For instance, there is no time transition between Lisa's life and death -- in one scene she's alive and well, in the next Peter is getting rid of her clothes. No fades, no subtle clues. It's completely baffling and deeply confusing.He also seems to lose his way in the movie's middle, which is mostly comprised of three things:1. Ralph talking about his romance with Lisa, her shoes, their vacations, etc.2. Peter looking angrily at pictures on the computer.3. Chess.And no, it isn't very interesting. It feels like there was a dearth of content between the beginning and the end, so it's filled up with endless chess games, talking and intense staring. There's some halfhearted attempts at introducing tension by having Peter's daughter pop up to complain occasionally, but the only part that is actually intriguing is a rather shocking revelation about Ralph's life.The sad thing is that the wildly talented cast is mostly wasted. Liam Neeson gives a beautifully tormented performance as a man driven by obsession, but at times he seems to lack direction ("GUCCI LOAFERS!"). Banderas gives a pretty heartrending portrayal of a man who seems to be a cosmopolitan rake at first, but is slowly revealed to be a much sadder, lonelier creature.As for the women, their parts are a lot flimsier. Garai is left with nothing to do but yell and whine at Neeson, and Linney is hardly more than a cameo. Oh, and I don't know why the emphasis on Abigail's husband, who is both nondescript and irrelevant."The Other Man" might have worked as a shorter movie or perhaps a stage play, but as a full-length movie it falls flat on its face -- and even the excellent actors can't save it.

$review_text.: The 1950's and 1960's produced a lot of stories about special Commandooperations in the Second World War.  Examples are "The Bridge on the River Kwai", "The Guns of Navarone", "Where Eagles Dare", "Force 10 From Navarone" and even stories involving the Royal Air Force like "633 Squadron".  This series, "The Rat Patrol" was produced to take advantage of this interest. This series is based on real-life groups like the "Long Range Desert Group" who harassed the Germans behind their lines in North Africa.  Although this series was made by  Americans, it should be pointed out that it was the British who really developed Commando operations to a high degree. This was due to several factors, one being that Britain was traditionally a Naval power and did not have a large standing army, so they had to get the maximum out of the limited forces they had, thus they encouraged their commandos to be bold by giving them a lot of independence, and secondly, the trauma due to the high casualties of the First World War gave the British the incentive to try to damage the enemy in indirect ways and not just throw massed armies at them frontally.  Thus, although these North African Commando groups were mostly British while this series was American, they included a British commando (portrayed well by actor Gary Raymond) into the Rat Patrol as homage to the real leaders in this field.  What is important is thatwe see the real-life-type dedication of the group, led by actor Chris George, to aggressively carry out their mission, almost without regard to the risk.Regarding the  series itself, I found the quality of the episodes improvedas the first season wore on, yet there were numerous problems. The half-hour format didn't allow many potential stories and characters to develop.  In real-life, Captain Dietrich, their perpetual nemesis, would have been shot for cowardice on more than one occasion as he let the Patrol get the best of him even though his men greatly outnumbered them.  In real life, much of the "German" army in North Africa was really made up of Italian soldiers, but we almost never see them.  One of the members of the Patrol, Hitchcock, insists on wearing a bright red hat (I presume in order to give him "character"), whereas everyone else, on both sides wears grey-brown uniforms which blend in over the surroundings.  It is comical seeing him peer over sand dunes with that hat which could be easily seen by the enemy!  Because this was American TV, even thoughthousands of rounds of ammunition are fired at them by the Germans, they are almost never hit, and if they are, it is never fatal, which of course, is not the nature of war (compare this with the more serious series "Combat" where Americans do get killed in the series).Having said this, I find the series quite entertaining with a lot of exiciting stunt work, and although theshow is, as I said , not "realistic", the types of missions the show depicts were frequently true-life, and in addition to being entertained,the viewer does get at least a partial idea of what the free-flowingwar in North Africa was like.

$review_text.: Erik Skjoldbjrg's "Insomnia" unfolds like a standard police procedural: murder, body, autopsy, evidence, suspect, questioning. But it is detective Jonas Engstr&ouml;m's (played by Stellan Skarsgrd) interest in this particular case, caused not just by the original murder but his implication surrounding it, where the film deviates from this formula. Engstr&ouml;m's involvement causes him to lose sleep - hence the title of the film - with his grasp on reality slipping from him, much like his investigation. Skjoldbjrg frames Skarsgrd in tight, dark claustrophobic spaces. When Skarsgrd walks through a dark alleyway, he comes alive, his senses and awareness heightened. His exposure to Norway's midnight sun dulls him. In another scene, he almost sexually assaults a front desk clerk. Here, again, Skjoldbjrg frames Skarsgrd in a tight shot within a dark, cramped room, the only bit of light coming from an unknown source. Skjoldbjrg's use of light and darkness is most obvious in Engstr&ouml;m's bedroom. Kept awake by the peering sun, Engstr&ouml;m covers his window with a thick, heavy sheet; at the same time, he is beginning to cover-up a crime and frame another. Toward the end of the second act, Engstr&ouml;m begins to have doubts about his actions, searching for a way to rid himself of his problem. Here, Skjoldbjrg's direction calls for Engstr&ouml;m's placing of a new sheet over the window, one much lighter than the previous with a perforation right in the center, light creeping through it and lighting Engstr&ouml;m's head. Throughout Insomnia, Engstr&ouml;m's moral center, along with Skjoldbjrg's direction, is an interplay between light and darkness. Note: This film was remade by Hollywood's current "IT" boy Christopher Nolan. Not having seen the remake, I cannot recommend it. However, what I have read about it leads me to believe that the original is the superior version

$REVIEW.: The movie itself is really good.  Mel Gibson is a very talented film maker.  I just wish that it had been more Biblically accurate.  There is a whole lot of conjecture, and I'm also tired of seeing Mary Magdalene portrayed as a whore.  There is no Biblical evidence of her being a whore.  Also, I know he's catholic, but enough already.  There is so much catholic ledgend in this movie, that this Christian was really bugged by it.  To his merit, I enjoyed the flashback sequences that he provides; probably during Jesus' last hours, he did reflect back on his ministry.  It's incredibly graphic, so either wait for the cut version to come out (some of the violent scenes are reduced), fast forward through it (like I did), or leave the room during those parts.  Although cinema pales in the face of reality, sometimes too much violence numbs or repulses us (I think the latter is some of what Gibson wanted).  Another good Jesus movie would be the Gospel of John.  This one, view if you want, but be forewarned about the accuracy and violence aspects.

$review_text.: Reverend Cotton Marcus (just a tad archaic), is admittedly a charlatan, a fraud. He admits that the only reason he wants to preach and entertain his congregation is so they keep coming back and filling up the offering plate. The same reason his father was a preacher.The movie is shot in a documentary style because what we are watching is a documentary being filmed of Cotton Marcus explaining his angle on religion, belief, and deception. He claims that on some level he is actually offering a service that helps people, even though he is fooling them.To prove how easy it is to cure people of the tormenting evil in their lives, he plans to respond to a request for an exorcism. It will be his last, and it will be filmed so that he can show how he sets up his gadgets and uses slight of hand to fool people that what they believe is real.On the way to their destination Marcus and his two-person film crew encounter the locals of Louisiana, and he wryly plays into their beliefs and superstitions by asking directions to scenes of cult activity or UFO landing sights. Many are happy to oblige, and know of it all, even though the places or events are contrived.Once they arrive at the location of the exorcism things get strange, and stranger. This is when the film starts getting good. The slow pace is countered by little scares, moments of excitement, and the hand-held camera lends to the realism. The film actually creeped me out. It is really spooky at times. Downright brutal at other times too.They meet a father, his son and his daughter, the latter who is the alleged possessed. Marcus figures this will be an easy one, and proceeds with his usual game to earn their trust and faith. Then he sets up to perform an exorcism on the girl. His effects work perfectly and the family, except for the boy (watch it), fall for it hoof, horn and demon. Sorry.In cheesy Exorcist-copy-cat fashion, of course, the Reverend falls to the floor after uttering to the demon "Take me!" or something to that effect. But it's okay, he's faking it. He pretends to be possessed, convulses a bit, then ends his charade with the smoking crucifix effect. Brilliant! Everyone is relieved that the demon is out of the girl.Not so fast. Things get really screwed up now. The girl shows up at the Reverend's motel room and appears to be possessed for real. Now Marcus must reevaluate. Is there something supernatural at hand, or is this girl just a mixed up kid who's mind was tweaked by some unfortunate incident?Ultimately, Marcus and his crew find themselves knee-deep in some Louisiana muck. And it's not what you think.That's all I can say or I'll give away the whole plot. Let me end by saying that his is a clever, well made film with a lot of spirit. Enjoy it. I did.

$review_text.: Barney Miller was a great series.  Well the first three seasons were fantastic.  The next two were great and the last three were just okay.Now that said.  I have to agree that it is terrible that Shout is only releasing the entire set and not the remaining seasons individually.  Many people had the same feelings about Mary Tyler Moore (the first 4 seasons were released by 20th and then Sony was to release the complete series.) but there was an uproar and the remaining sets were released over a year.  So for those who do not want repay for sets they already have, then don't and wait it out.On the good side, is that Shout has priced this reasonably this set at about $20 a season MSRP.  Less than that if you include the season of Fish.  And if you are willing to wait a little, someone (probably Amazon) will have it on sale over the holidays for at least 50% off.Lastly, don't trust Shout to provide complete episodes.  About half the episodes in the first season of Rhoda were the edited syndicated episodes.  I am not blaming them because they can only release what they are given.  So if you are expecting the original uncut episodes, beware.

$REVIEW.: Let's face it, horror movies usually suck, and it was always inevitable that a sequel about Michael Myers coming back to Haddonfield in Illinois was a given. Halloween 2 valiantly continued the story of the killer and it was supposed to end with that one as it truly ended with a true bang. But of course the money hungry hands of Hollywood could only keep Michael at bay for so long. Skipping over III completely, (which had nothing to do with Michael Myers, we have Part 4, The Return of Michael Myers.John Carpenter is gone, with the exception of his themed music, we have director Dwight Little taking a stab at the Halloween story. Carpenter is sorely missed, but amazingly, this is a scary movie and keeps the faith of Carpenters original, well almost. Carpenter agreed after Part II that there simply wasn't really any storyline left for the character. Looks like Part 4 proved that wrong. With the exception of Donald Pleasance (Loomis), the original cast of characters from 1978 are totally gone. Loomis renews his role as Michael's doctor. As stated in another review, basically ignore the end of part II, as both Michael and Loomis should be dead, literally. (they were basically burned alive).Part 4 concerns the daughter of (Jamie Lee Curtis) Lorie Strode. Jamie Lee supposedly died and her daughter was adopted by a new family in Haddonfield. Michael Myers of course, laying nearly dead from Part II, hears about the little girl in his dark asylum. He, of course, wants to kill finish off the rest of the family, so of course he now gets out, and goes after the daughter of Laurie Strode.Jamie Lee is nowhere to be found in the movie as her character was believed to have died in car wreck, but we certainly find that to be untrue with the future release of H20 - 20 Years Later. Halloween 4 is a very dark movie. Nearly 75%, not surprisingly takes place at night. The movie, similar to the original, focuses more on suspense and only a small amount of gore. The pacing is fast and keeps you in suspense for most of the movie. Also true to the Halloween genre, there really isn't much blood in this one as proven once before that you don't need gore and guts to make a good scary movie.The music score is "Carpenter" reminisce all the way with some great use of synthesizers and classic piano themes from the original. If I had one pet peave about the movie is the mask they used. The faceless shape mask of Michael Myers was amazing looking in Part I and Part II. But in part 4, the mask is seems a bit too white, or it's just to bright for it's own good and is not nearly as scary as the "shapes" mask in the original. But other than this minor nitpick, the killer "Michael" is a force to be recokned with.Loomis has some fine moments and enjoy him in part 4, because although he returns for the next two Halloween outings, the next two are not worth your time as 4 should have been the last Halloween movie, at least until H20 with the return of Jamie Lee Curtis.Halloween 1 was the best, Halloween 2 took a close second and then we have Halloween 4 which keeps the faith and is simply a good scary movie. You can never take out an original like Halloween, but thanks to fine acting, great music, and the force of Michael Myers, you'll have fun with this one for sure. Highly recommended.

$review_text.: Wild Things is one of the most draw dropping movies I've ever seen. It had so many twists and turns I had to see it again to believe what I had seen earlier and had just seen again.Matt Dillon plays a high school counsler at a high school in South Florida. He is well respected and loved by the students. He is really loved by his student played by Denise Richards. She likes to him to a very dangerous point. She later accuses of him of rape to the local cop played by Kevin Bacon along with another student played by Neve Campbell. Matt's character is hated by the community and he hires a lawyer played by Bill Murray to defend him. However, the movie turns into a story of sex, murder, and betrayl that like I said earlier will leave you saying "WOW" and have you watching it again.Denise Richards is absolutely crazy in this movie. I couldn't believe this was the sweet innocent girl I had seen in Starship Troopers. Denise, Matt, and Neve shoot a soft porn in the movie when they do a three some. I couldn't believe it. I think this is the best acting Denise has done in her young carear. She is a beautiful woman and I love her to death. Most guys become a fan of her from watching this.Kevin Bacon has a nice role in the film. It's one of the better performances of his carear. I hate his character in the movie. He plays a huge role in the film though, and Bacon liked this movie so much he helped produce it.This is a different kind of role for Matt Dillon in the beginning of the movie. However, by the end he won't disappoint his loyal fans as he returns to the kind of character he typically plays.I liked Wild Things. It's an insane sexual thriller. If nudity is not your thing I would not get this movie. Nevertheless if you want to see a movie with a ton and twists and turns this is it. Men will really like Denise in the movie. But like I said this movie will leave you saying "WOW" and will have you watching at again.

$review_text.: Maybe, but probably not. Inspired is a word that could not possibly be used with this complete "mess" of a movie. If there were to be an award for "Worst Screenplay Ever Written" then David Benioff should win that award - absolutely no competition need apply. The other interesting note is how the director of Das Boot has sunk this low - but not surprising since his last outing was almost as bad (The Perfect Storm). Now he has given us "The Perfect Mess" - what a waste of time, talent, energy, and money. Even Brad cannot save this movie (even though he does give it a courageous try). Ironic at best (and not even a guilty pleasure). A total loss!

$review_text.: One of those films that I just totally adored from start to finish, `Adam's Rib' is a fantastic romantic comedy that thrives on its stellar cast and smart scripting.  Even when the film starts to fray towards the end (this may be a personal opinion, but I found the last few minutes to be rather off-putting and unnecessary), it never truly leaves the audience.The film is exciting and fun and just all around pure entertainment!Hepburn and Tracy (I love Spencer Tracy SOOOOO much) play Adam and Amanda Bonner, husband and wife lawyers who wind up on opposite ends of a court room when jilted wife Doris Attinger shoots her philandering husband and his lover (she doesn't actually wound the lover).  Adam is handed the prosecution of the case, but his wife (who firmly believes that this is her chance to rally the equality of women) takes the defense and together they turn the courtroom (and their marriage) on its head.The acting across the board is phenomenal.  Hepburn and Tracy worked a lot with one another, and it is obvious why.  They really have such undeniable chemistry, and here they play off one another so beautifully.  Hepburn has the more triumphant and stirring moments, but Tracy, for me, is the standout of the two.  He really understands the quieter moments and plays them to perfection.  Even in the films final frames, where I see the script starting to lose steam, he manages to make his character so likable and memorable that you can't help but forgive the scene.But, and I mean this in a BIG way, the film's grandest performance comes from the GLORIOUS Judy Holliday.  What I love so much about this performance is that it feels so modern in its approach.  I mean, there is no doubt in my mind that that very performance can be seen in a film today, and that is saying a lot since the whole style and craft of acting has changed a lot since the 40's.  It lacks the overtly theatrical stylings of the day and instead layers the character with a sharp sense of pure naturalism.Holliday is flawless!So, the film is really a rich and entertaining ride.  With the ethics of law, love and equality all thrown on the cutting board, `Adam's Rib' really covers a lot of ground.  Instead of coming across as hurried and stuffed though, the film covers that ground very nicely.  Sure, it doesn't really come together on all areas, but the bell was sounded and the players all came to the rescue, delivering something that is the epitome of entertainment.

$review_text.: Voyager pretty much degenerated into implausibility the last seasons, and it even affected Seven of Nine.  But before that, there was Kes, who you can't fail to like.  There was the ever rough-edged Tom Paris, who achieved one of the most convincing transformations.  There was the rough edge of B'Elanna Torres."Prime Factors" has to be one of the better episodes, introducing the Seska arc.  And the writers could have done so much more with the Chakotay/Janeway romance.  This season reminds us of the possibilities that once seemed as endless as the Delta Quadrant.

$review_text.: I am happy to say that the eighth season of EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND was brilliantly funny, and the addition of Fred Willard, Georgia Engel and Chris Elliott as Amy Barone (Monica Horan)'s father, mother and brother were a great choice indeed.  For starters, the Puritan beliefs are a great contrast to the outrageous antics of Ray Barone (Ray Romano)'s parents, Frank (Peter Boyle) and Marie (Doris Roberts).  They make several appearances during the course of season eight.  What's more, the rest of the ensemble maintains a joyous atmosphere of neurosis and genuinely human flaws.  Celebrate their faultiness with them, here, and you won't regret it for a minute.

$review_text.: In The Sensorites, the first Doctor trips over a race of beings who are hypersensitive and they all look alike. Even to each other.The six chapter serial may seem to drag a bit, but there's enough political intrigue to keep this early adventure watchable.Barbara is missing for most of the story, but that doesn't matter as the Sensorites are the focus of it.Misunderstanding leads to fear and treachery and ignorance gets put in its place in this unexpectedly well acted show.It's not perfect. Early BBC allowed many mistakes and goofs. There's missed cues and at one point late in the story you can see the microphone as if it was meant to be part of the cast of characters.Those bits aside, William Hartnell is great as ever and Carol Ann Ford is not annoying at all.There are enough special features, including a documentary about the writer of the episode, Peter R. Newman, to justify the expense.I'd give it five stars, but the clunky sets are hard to get over.The writing is fantastic, though.

$review_text.: [.....] .I like a lot of these low-budget stinkers,but this one was boring,strongly lacking of gore and the soundtrack wasn't that great,(cool electronic?)as the one amazon reviewer stated(A big FU very much  4 trapping me into this purchase). The source material is chopped and patched up with different source materials ranging from dark and fuzzy to then suddenly clean and clear.There are 4 death scenes,2 of which where the victims are strangled.The other 2 death scenes include a small pen sized surgical saw and an oven that last for about 5 seconds,but are hardly enough to hold up the rest of the movie.There is barley a drip of blood ,let alone gore!.I have to also mention there wasn't a morsel of sex,sleaze,nudity(none)laughs(unintentional or not comedy!?!) to be found at all.That's just unacceptable considering there wasn't much of a plot and the gore and sleaze is why I buy Joe D'Amato movies with titles such as 'The Grim Reaper' to begin with.It's not as if you go into one of his movies expecting to be moved by the script that was written,as if there was any real story other then the sex,blood and guts set up there to shock and gross you out.I want gore and sleaze!!!!!Mr. A'Amato,that is what I expect from an A'Mato film!!!!!!!!!!!!!!No less!!!What we get here is a waste of time!!!!!!!!!!!No fun to be had at all.Take it from me.I own many bad horror movies that entertained me enough that I would watch again .I can even enjoy a lot that tend to drag a bit so long as they are tension builders and there is a pay off!!!!!!![...]BTW;Laura Gemser isn't in this movie and beside having George Eastman cast,this has nothing to do with Anthropophagus 1(Grim Reaper 1),which was also a bit of a bore,but made up for it with the creepy atmosphere and(cheezy)gross out kill scenes.

It's ultimately a sweet and hopeful movie about people trying to survive in a world that has been ravaged by war and disease.  There are a few plot points that didn't make a lot of sense to me but overall the acting and scenery were spot on.  The sets were realistic and the scenery was at moments serenely beautiful and at others desolate and lifeless.  I also have to comment on the soundtrack.  The music was wonderful.  If a CD was available, I would definitely buy it.  So, don't let the really bad cover scare you away from a real treat of a movie.

$review_text.: ...and no wonder, it's directed by Christopher Nolan, who did the sensational "Memento" (2000) and almost-as-good "Insomnia."  If you have never seen those movies you should, to understand just what this man was capable of before getting ensnared by the major American studios.  Definitely not your typical big-budget Hollywood cheeseball, Nolan has an original vision and style.What sets this film apart is the fact that it has a well-developed, well-written and believable psychological AND philosophical backstory, rather than being just another special effects and computer-animation orgy.With the exception of the inevitable "Batman saves the day at the last moment in dramatic showdown with the evil head honcho" final 10 minutes, it had me guessing most of the way through.  The weakest link as others have noted, was casting Katie Holmes, who is a cutie but has an acting range of maybe 3 rubber expressions (self-righteous, confused, scared).

Pic is not refrence quility but is still worth the upgrade.  It comes with a decent amont of extras that are fun, and a digtal copy as well.Now the movie, this is one of the funist films I have seen in a long time.  There is also a ton of action.  Crank 2 moves along at an extremly fast pace.  Some may say this film lacks content but I disagree.  Pace, violence and totaly over the top moments (the whole film really) is the content.  The plot is very simple. Chev must keep his body charged and get his heart back, while engageing in "mayhem, murder,and lewd behavor" and say a ton of cuss words.  Now A word of warning if you are offended easaly DON'T WATCH THIS.  There are a ton of shocking moments in this film where all I could do was laugh and say I can't belive they just did that.  This movie's greatest strength is also its biggist weakness.  It will make some people laugh and cheer well others will be offended.

I knew that when I rented it and was not disappointed. There are no awards to be won here. Acting was a hair spotty once in awhile. There was a bunch of annoying camera angle darting abouts that went on too long and didn't seem to fit with the flow. The main male seemed way too ignorant of the potential career-ending relationship that was brewing. His ignorance was a bit annoying to the point that I was happy when he started paying for it.  But I'm a Rose fan and I think she actually did a fine job as the psycho lead. There was one particularly brutal scene that surprisingly made me squirm. Had to do with who was beating on whom. But the dark comedy was rich and often delivered in blase form, which made it enjoyable overall.

$REVIEW.: This remastered version of the pilot of the television seriesStargate SG-1works well as a stand alone feature, and if all you ever plan to watch is this then I would definitely recommend it

However, if you are looking for something to work as an introduction to the television series, then I would say you should avoid this and just stick with the original version (which would be available as part of the season one DVD set or with the complete series collection).Yes, this version does have some improvements

Some of the effects are better


Even though it has its detractors, I think that the redubbing of Teal'c's dialogue works well
Some of the added bits of scenes are nice

And (while I'm not one to object to it) the nudity in the pilot did seem out of place and would also make the show difficult to introduce to children, so the removal of it is not a loss.However, some of the other things that were cut are moments that, as a fan of the show, were memorable and now are very noticable in their absence


The extra banter between O'Niell and Hammond before getting right down to business may have slowed down the pacing a bit, but showed a hint of the relationship those two characters would build as the show progressed

Sam's "reproductive organs" line was indeed cringe worthy, but the fact that much later in the series it is jokingly referenced at least twice leaves those later references as orphaned punchlines with no set up

I hated the removal of Sam's usage of "McGivering" the Starrage, a nice little in-joke that didn't stick out like a sore thumb if you didn't get the joke but would put a brief smile on your face if you did.And worst of all, I think, is removing the elements that led to the episode ending on a cliffhanger that would be picked up on the following episode

That is why I said that this version works well as a stand alone feature, and it is clearly how the powers behind the scenes treated it when they prepared it
But, let us face it, this is NOT a stand alone feature

It is the first episode of a series, and the next episode -- while it still works -- is a lot more confusing and doesn't play as smoothly with the set-up for it cut from this episode.If you have no intention of continuing past this episode, if the small bit of nudity present in the original version would overly bother you, or if you are a Stargate SG-1 completionist, then this release may be for you
Otherwise, you may as well stick with the original version.


$SUMMARY.: Good as a stand-alone piece, but doesn't work within the context of the series.

$REVIEW.: There's a part of me that feels a bit guilty proclaiming King Kong my favorite movie of 2005. After all, as a movie buff I'm supposed to favor serious dramatic pictures with important social and human messages or little independent art house movies shot on a minuscule budget. Certainly not a $200 million behemoth about a giant ape crammed with nonstop action sequences and special effects. However, the fact remains: King Kong is my favorite movie of 2005. I can be biased against big-budget movies as I'm sure a lot of movie buffs are, however what ultimately matters is not the size of the budget or number of special effects shots. Small-budget indie movies can be very bad, and big-budget Hollywood movies can be very good. What makes the difference is the passion and craftsmanship on display. The interest and love that the filmmakers have for the material and the ability to pull it off. With Peter Jackson's King Kong there is not a single frame on the screen in its 187-minute duration that lacks passion or craftsmanship. This is a very personal movie for Peter Jackson, perhaps even more personal than The Lord of the Rings. While watching the movie you can almost see nine-year-old Peter pretending to film Kong climbing the Empire State Building in his backyard. In reality, Jackson is 44 and the backyard is now a huge New Zealand movie set, however the passion is still there. King Kong is not your typical action/special effects movie. If it were, it would not even make my favorite movies list, much less top it. This is an action/special effects movie helmed by Peter Jackson. The man who made it possible for a special effects/fantasy film to sweep the Academy Awards. It should be no surprise that his latest is more than just flashy brain candy.King Kong is a success both as epic spectacle and dramatic storytelling. Essentially it's a love story between a woman and a 25-foot ape. The fact that the woman actually has chemistry with the ape is only one of this movie's wonders. The film contains some of the most amazing sights you're likely to see on the motion picture screen, but never at the expense of drama and characterization. It has moments that are genuinely moving, for example one scene towards the end involving Ann Darrow and Kong on a frozen pond. It has moments that are frightening, such as the second act on Skull Island where Carl Denham and crew encounter any type of slimy oversized beast you could imagine. It has thrills and lots of them. The Skull Island scenes have some of the most astonishing action sequences anyone has seen. Even when the movie seems to be turning into Jurassic Park 4, Peter Jackson always manages to put something new and refreshing on the screen. He consciously avoids showing the dinosaurs in a familiar way. Each time a new dino appears on the screen, Jackson utilizes  it in a way that we've never seen before. Kong's fight with multiple T-Rexes is sure to go down in cinematic history along with the epic battle from Jackson's Return of the King. The final act of the film, in which Kong is brought captive to New York City, is as spectacular as anything on Skull Island. If you've seen the 1933 film, or even if you haven't, you know what happens but it is still an incredible, very moving finale. The whole Empire State Building sequence is just amazing.Much will be said about the actors in King Kong. I think most everyone will agree that Naomi Watts is superb as Ann Darrow, doing justice to Fay Wray in the original. There will be some dispute over whether or not Jack Black was right for the role of Carl Denham and I will say that I don't think he was the best choice. However, Jack truly does his best and I think he gives an admirable performance even if he does seem to be a little bit out of his league. I was pretty pleased with Adrien Brody as Jack Driscoll as well. No complaints. The real star of the movie, however is Kong. Given life by Andy Serkis (Gollum in Lord of the Rings), Kong is a true marvel. Here is a giant 25-foot computer-generated ape that actually gives a believable and quite moving performance. It really must be seen to be believed. In any of the closeups of Kong's face, you will in no way be aware that you are looking at a special effect. Quite a tremendous accomplishment by Andy Serkis and the effects team at WETA.With all of my praise, I do not think King Kong is a perfect movie. It has a few little problems here and there, but for me at least, they did not detract from the movie going experience at all. A lot of people will say that the movie is too long, running a meaty three hours. I think the lengthy running time suits it just fine. This is an epic story and the extra hour allows Jackson time to flesh out his world with details and extra character development that make all the difference in creating a real film instead of just a special effects picture. Also, although I think second act of the film is utterly amazing, it does go a little bit overboard with the creepy crawly creatures. We expect lots of dangerous animal life, but in addition to the dinosaurs we have a giant carnivorous snail-type creature, killer bats, giant spiders and all sorts of huge man-eating insects. After a while it becomes creature overkill which is cool, but slightly redundant. A few less monsters would have been fine. This portion of the movie also does strain credibility at times. I really don't think that you could shoot giant insects off another guy's back with a machine gun without shooting him. Act two does require some suspension of disbelief.Even with those quibbles, King Kong is a spectacular movie. I would highly recommend it to everyone except perhaps small children. The Skull Island scenes will be very frightening to kids. Movie lovers of all ages will find much to love in this beautiful, touching and exciting update of Merian C. Cooper's classic story of beauty and the beast. It is another triumph for director Peter Jackson and one of the best movies of 2005.As for the Extended Edition, well this is King Kong, not Lord of the Rings. The movie is not improved by the extra scenes. I would recommend sticking with the theatrical version, although there are some very worthwhile extras on that DVD set if you're willing to shell out the cash.

$REVIEW.: I don't know a thing about Norse mythology or the Marvel comics featuring Thor

 I had to accept this movie on its own terms as a live action comic book that couldn't decide if it was meant to be funny or to be taken seriously

 It literally starts in the dark and stays there far longer than it should, even when one of the characters teases, "wait for it............."  I did

 What followed was a little fancy in the sky, a dust tornado, and the thud of Thor almost becoming road kill
 A bit of history was imparted in a grandiose manner


 Lots of CGI was employed (it seems these days that action films are becoming more animated than live action)


 The plot involves two brothers born to be kings, but there can be only one!  One is arrogant (Thor), the other is just plain sneaky (Loki)

 What follows is insubordination, insurrection, and expulsion to the planet Earth (the all-purpose penal colony for superheroes)


 There's even a comparison to be had with The Sword in the Stone (who is worthy to wield the hammer of Thor!?)
 Many pull but only one can master it.As far as action packed superhero flicks go, this one does what it's supposed to (which is neither faint praise nor vain glory)

 No one really stood out
 The villain of the piece, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) was a bit wishy-washy

 Anthony Hopkins opted out for a snooze


 I didn't even realize Rene Russo (Odin's wife) was even in this film!It was entertaining

 I did like it
 But I expected more than just a little razzle-dazzle


 If they come out with a Thor 2 I'd see it and hope for the best (because this certainly wasn't).

It goes without saying that &#34;Josie and the Pussycats&#34; would perk my interest, as well.&#34;Josie and the Pussycats&#34; is the iconic cartoon adaptation of the &#34;Josie and the Pussycats&#34; comic by Archie comics (it has quite an interesting history, actually).  And this DVD contains all 16 episodes for you to enjoy at your own leisure.  Just to clarify, this does not contain the spinoff series &#34;Josie and the Pussycats in Space&#34; because that is it's own series...and there is also a DVD set for that, too).  Throughout the series, you follow Josie and company as they travel the world for the sake of performing...only to wind up getting caught in (or more specifically dragged into) some crazy hijinks.  The character archetypes are stereotypical...and the stories are pretty predictable.  But it is well done and the character chemistry simply wonderful.  There's tons to laugh at as well...and the music is always a trip.  It is quite imaginative and stands the test of time for what it is.THE PACKAGE ITSELF:The set contains two discs that are contained and secured in a cardboard case (which opens up like a book or a typical &#34;thank you&#34; card) and is further protected by a second cardboard sleeve.  As far as that goes, I am quite satisfied.  The DVDs, themselves, are arranged on one side in an overlapping kind of plastic clip.  The product images show it quite well.  Personally, I'm not a fan of that, but it's not too big a deal.  At least, there IS enough &#34;air&#34; in between the 2 discs so they don't scratch each other.  The 2nd Disc is a double- sided disc which contains both the rest of the episodes and the special feature.  I'm not a fan of double-sided discs neither...but I can live with it.SPECIAL FEATURES:Well, to be honest, I would have wished for more special features (I do like documentary style type special features) as there is only one special feature.  But at least the one that they do include is rather decent, lengthy (as far as special features go), educational, and plain amazing insight.  Now, this is not a documentary about &#34;Josie and the Pussycats&#34; per se.  Rather, it is a remembrance of the man that brought life to &#34;Josie and the Pussycats&#34; from his wife and the people that worked with him.  A little bit about &#34;Josie and the Pussycats&#34; is covered, naturally...but it's more focused on the kind of man and artist that the late Dan DeCarlo was...that and a bit of where he came from.  Folks wanting to learn tons more about Josie and the pussycats, exclusively, will be disappointed.  But if you are more interested in the man, then this is a valuable piece of insight.QUALITY:I played this on an HD set up, but I found nothing really wrong with it.  Maybe I'm just not that picky on the visual...but it looked fine to me.  And the audio quality is good and solid.  And it goes without saying that the music still shines.  The whole presentation reminded me of the days when I watched it back on Cartoon Network.ALL IN ALL:I'm really glad to have this show in my collection to enjoy time and time again.  Though, I would have preferred slightly better packaging plan and a bit more special features, this is still a solid set at an affordable price.  There's nothing like the Pussycats and I'm glad I can listen to their concerts over and over again ^_^

$review_text.: Like many others in the UK I came across this American sit-com after a recommendation by a friend. It's laugh out loud hilarious, very cleverly written, often subtle, at times quite moving and totally addictive.Episodes are 20 minutes long so watching three back-to-back for an hour is a perfect way to brighten up your evening without "overkill".Just finished Series 1 and find it difficult to believe that the next three series can keep up such an incredibly high standard, but the reviews suggest they do.A brilliant discovery and a view endorsed by everyone else I know who's discovered it...
$SUMMARY.: Series 1 - a sheer joy to watch...

$review_text.: I know I typed a review for this several months back, and I liked it. But  it seems the more time goes by, the less I like it. I really can't explain  why. It ain't the gore (i am a huge fan of celebrity deathmatch). It ain't  the one scene where the guys throat gets slit. (i can take that stuff!) I  DID see Scary Movie though, which really put it to shame. Scary Movie  rules!!!!!!!!! Anyway, I don't know why, but it just isn't as appealing  anymore. The Scream 3 soundtrack was awesome though.

$review_text.: In a sequel the idea is usually not just to continue the story but to do the same thing, only different


 "The Hills Have Eyes 2" is still set in the desert, still involves the nuclear family of mutant cannibals, and still has a group of victims with a propensity for doing stupid things that get them killed


 What is different is that instead of a more traditional nuclear family being the lambs led to the slaughter this time it is a group of National Guardsmen on a training exercise

 The other significant differences would be that this time around the victims know what is happening much earlier in the film and that a lot of it takes place while the brutal desert sun is up
 There is an interesting trend in recent horror films to actually try and scare the audience while characters are running around in bright light instead of always waiting until the sun goes down.I like the idea of introducing a bunch of soldiers with big guns into the mix, but "The Hills Have Eyes 2," but because they are National Guards troops they end up falling apart at the seams pretty quickly


 I would not say that the makers of this film are trying to make a comment on the combat readiness of the Guard in a time when tens of thousands of them are serving on active duty in Iraq, but I would have preferred to see a more seasoned group of soldiers going up against the mutants, something more akin to "Dog Soldiers" or "Predator," with a running fire fight through the hills


 They have guns and equipment, but apparently do not know what to do with them or how to best protect themselves, especially since their leader is one of the first to go down


 But you know this group is in trouble when it becomes clear that Amber Johnson (Jessica Stroup) and Missy Martinez (Daniella Alonso), are two of the best soldiers in the bunch

 When it comes to adding insult to injury, wait and see which guy lasts the longest.While this movie is generally disappointing, it does have several "ewwww" moments that actually got a response from me, starting with the opening sequence and ending with how Amber lets her fingers do the walking in the climax


 For what it is worth, this film makes the best use of a porta-potty of any horror film I can recall

 Wes Craven, who wrote and directed the original 1977 version of "The Hills Have Eyes," wrote the screenplay for this one along with his son Jonathan ("The Outpost")

 "The Hills Have Eyes 2" is a sequel to the 2006 remake "The Hills Have Eyes," but I would not really say it is a remake of "The Hills Have Eyes, Part 2."  That last one had a group of bikers on a bus that breaks down in the desert (talk about a one step forward, two steps back idea)


 Director Martin Weisz had made "Rohtenburg" the year before, with Kerri Russell as a grad student who becomes obsessed with the cannibal killer she is researching in Germany, and he does not even try to emulate everything Alexandre Aja came up with when he directed the remake
 If you saw that film, then you should probably check this one out, but any horror fan knows full well to always expect less from a sequel.


$review_summary.: This sequel to the remake has its moments, but no real momentum

$REVIEW.: This is quite simply one of the best westerns ever made. I don't know why people like to compare this film with other John Ford classics, they don't have anything in common, and they both have very different takes on how a western should be made. Sergio Leone's characters are mythic figures of great proportion, be they heroes, antiheroes or villains. It is true that casting Henry Fonda as the villain was a stroke of genius, and I was amazed at how good Charles Bronson is in this film. But nobody gives enough attention to Jason Robards, I mean he comes this close to stealing the whole film. Robards is now remembered as one of the best of the character actors, but seeing this film I wonder why he never got a leading-man status. He steals every scene and his quiet scenes with Claudia Cardinale are extraordinarily tender and human (rare in a Leone western), his puppy-eyed expression and wis way of delivenring his dialogue accompanied with Morricone's excellent score (one of the best ever for a western) are just pure bliss. The final mythic showdown is also a sight to see and 'experience', Morricone's score adds a lot to the impact of the film. Claudia Cardinale, WHAT A WOMAN, she's an exotic italian voloptous beauty, the kind of girl you'd be more than happy to marry and have kids with. What a pressesnce though. The story is so-so and reality is blown way out of proportions, but one doesn't look for much reality or plausibility in a Spaguetti western. All in all, if you like westerns, you'll love this one, even though there is a lot more attention paid to the characters themselves than to really trying to make a statement on the taming of the west (as John Ford does). Is this the best Leone film? well 'The Good, the bad and the ugly' is also stunning, although not as mythic or overblown as this one and 'Once Upon a Time In America' is also very noteworthy, so it would depend on what you're looking for. I would highly recommend this film, and if you want to buy it, pick up the letterboxed edition because this film was not meant to be seen in it's cropped-up version! All in all, a solid 8.5 out of 10!!!

$review_text.: Thankfully I watched this movie having recorded it on my DVR so I could fast forward through most of the scenes with Uma Thurman and John Travolta.  Their scenes and dialogue were so horrible that fast forward was the only way to get through the movie.  Besides, this is not the kind of movie that you really need their dialogue to understand or enjoy it.As usual, Uma's acting is simply dreadful. I tend to avoid any movie with her in it because I know it will be bad.  How she became a "star" in Hollywood is beyond me.  She is not attractive nor can she act.  She could have been replaced by a nobody and it wouldn't have changed the movie one bit.  I think when they need an actress who doesn't mind playing drivel roles, they call her. John Travolta is not much better.  His version of "cool" just doesn't do it for me. His diction is becoming more slurred as the years go by that I hate to hear him speak.  And someone please tell Uma and John that nobdody wants to see them dance so please just stop finding reasons to do so.The ONLY reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because of The Rock and Vince Vaughn.  Their roles were priceless and had me laughing all throughout the movie.  I never grew tired of Vaughn pimping and The Rock primping.  While I fast forwarded through Uma and Travolta's scenes, I tended to rewind during Rock's and Vaughn's scenes; they were so funny I had to see them again.  Cedric the Entertainer was also pretty good.

$REVIEW.: While some critics claim that season 4 began to lose momentum, and didn't have the same power that the previous seasons did. In reviewing it again I have to disagree. The beginning 4 episode story arc, episodes 'No Sympathy For The Devil,' and Time out of Mind,' just to name a very few of the excellent episodes from this hard hitting and action packed season, really showcase the talent of Peta Wilson, Roy Dupuis, and the rest of this brilliantly chosen cast.If you've enjoyed the previous three seasons you must see this. Better than anything currently on television.

$REVIEW.: Movies like this are why people should read reviews before purchasing. It should have been no surprise about the violence if you were familiar with the graphic novels. I don't normally go for such violent and gory films, but I like watching Stevenson and Salmon so I gave it a chance. At least it's not brainless, hence my 4-star rating. There a plot and a purpose to this film. And, the ending is okay. Not recommended for the faint of heart.

Hosted by Cornelius/Caesar/Galen himself, Roddy McDowell.  This documentary tells the complete story of the films, with loads of behind the scenes information, photos, and footage.  You also get to see some of the original makeup test used to sell Fox on the film (but not the ENTIRE test, as the packaging implies), as well as some promotional material, and an interview with McDowell.  The interview is a mixed-bag, as there is no microphone on the person CONDUCTING the interview, so you can bately hear the questions (if at all).  That minor grievance aside, this is a fantastic, 2-disc set, and I recommend this to any Planet Of The Apes fan.

$review_text.: Daredevil, Theatrical and Director's Cut, is a better movie than half of the films coming out now? So what it didn't make a billion dollars. Daredevil isn't a well known character like Spider-man. It made money, created a few hits songs...It's not a perfect film. The love story in the original, the Coolio scenes from the director's bog it down. But. there's more going for it than against.Daredevil was the first comic movie (or one of the first) to show realistic tolls of being a hero. The scene where Matt Murdock climbs into the bath sore and battered comes to mind. It disregarded strict visuals when casting the Kingpin. It took chances on a whole bunch of things. Get off its back.

$review_text.: Oddly depressing Doris Day film story has more in common with proto-noir type movies like POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE or A STAR IS BORN than later Day musicals.  This one definitely concentrates on "Day of the Locust" spectacle of talent flocking to Hollywood for their big break, only to meet shabby treatment and disappointment.  The movie leaves a sour taste in one's mouth.  I'd say a good 3/5 of this film is all about how hard Jack Carson sweats to get Doris a chance as a singer, but nobody wants to take a flyer on an untried talent.  And you feel for him, but it doesn't change the fact that he's sort of a florid "death of a salesman" sort of loser.Scene after scene, beautifully directed by Michael (FOUR DAUGHTERS) Curtiz, plays up the angle of the beautiful scenery (has Los Angeles ever looked so dreamy>) versus the shattered dreams of movieland wannabes.  I;ve never been a huge fan of S Z Sakalln, the Austrian actor known as "Cuddles," but he's especially repulsive here as a radio sponsor with absolute, godlike powers over the little people who toil on his show, "The Hour of Enchantment."  He has only one soft spot, a tiny dog he calls "Sally."  He's creepy here, like Charles Coburn in THE PARADINE CASE.  Every time Jack Carson has to approach him to ask him to listen to Miss Day one more time, you cringe, for Cuddles doesn't show a single sign of humanity, his self-aborption and selfishness reach Bunuelian levels.And what is with the all girl orchestra, dressed in flimsy pastel togas, run by that martinet conductor?  How lesbian were they trying to get?  The conductor is stern enough to make Eve Arden, the radio producer who oversees their work, seem like a femme next to her.As many have noted, the surreal part of the film is an animated sequence, set at Easter time, in which Doris' little son Freddie, who doesn't otherwise play much of a part in the action of the film overall, is left alone in a fancy bedroom crowded with stuffed rabbits and Easter eggs.  He's sleepy and the film changes to a Dali evocation of his nightmares; the walls pull back, the toys grow huge, and suddenly Bugs Bunny (and Tweety) appear singing this crazy "Wake Up" type number that terrifies the little boy.  It's so anxiety provoking that even watching it I broke out into a sweat.  It just gets worse and worse as two stuffed rabbits turn into Doris Day and Jack Carson, who sing faster and faster while dressed in Uncle Wiggily rabbit costumes.  I haven't seen anything as frightening in years, not since the SCREAM movies came out.  And yet the grim, anxiety-filled mise-en-scene of MY DREAM IS YOURS is a fertile hatching ground for the birth of monsters.Bring to DVD, please!

$review_text.: "Star Wars" stands as one of the breakthrough science fiction classics

George Lucas drew on timeless archetypes (thanks to his friendship with mythologist Joseph Campbell) to make an adventure for the ages


"Star Wars" has an outwardly simple story

Luke Skywalker,an orphan growing up on Tatooine with his aunt&uncle;,wants to leave his homeworld and explore the cosmos
His grizzled mentor, Obi-Wan Kenobi,leads him into an unexpected adventure


Little does Luke know what's in store for him


On the way,he meets up with the witty robots C3PO and R2D2,as well as the handsome smuggler Han Solo

Luke learns the ways of the Force, goes to rescue Princess Leia..
and the rest is cinematic history."Star Wars" succeeds not just because of its simple story (Lucas was daring in having it be in media res as "Episode Four") and astounding special effects,but because of its talented actors

Alec Guinness achieved cinematic immortality as Luke's cranky mentor

Carrie Fisher is spunky as Princess Leia


Peter Cushing is appropriately menacing as the Grand Moff Tarkin

James Earl Jones voices Darth Vader,giving him a diabolical screen presence


Finally, Harrison Ford is appealing as the swaggering,sexy anti-hero/heroic smuggler Han Solo

Needless to say,Han Solo was my first screen crush
Unfortunately,the original Star Wars trilogy is all about Luke's Hero's Journey,and Han is a supporting character

No director's cut can make the trilogy All About How Han Saved the Universe and Won Princess Leia's Heart."Star Wars" has staying power


Nearly 3 decades later,it's still a fun popcorn classic

$review_text.: If you like to flip the channel dexterously between "The Sopranos" and the Food Network, this 2000 movie may be for you

Directed by Bob Giraldi, who is still probably most famous for directing a pre-surgery Michael Jackson in his "Beat It" video, the story is set in one evening almost entirely within the confines of a trendy downtown Manhattan restaurant in the trendy TriBeCa neighborhood

Giraldi succeeds in developing and maintaining a sense of combustible energy when it comes to an upscale restaurant's inner workings
He should know since he is part-owner of several such restaurants of which the one featured, Gigino Trattoria, is one
By comparison, the film feels less assured when it comes to the cross currents of its multiple dramatic elements.Although the movie has an omnibus feel about it, the plot primarily focuses on the inevitable conflicts between Louis, the old-school owner and Udo, his ambitious, hotshot chef son
It helps that Danny Aiello plays Louis in such an economical fashion as he can make his character's melodramatic situation convincing - quitting a bookmaking side-business that got his partner killed and handing over the reigns of the eatery to his son
Screenwriters Rick Shaughnessy and Brian Kalata have crafted a tight script, though there is a cursory feel to the film that gives us a Robert Altman-like hodgepodge of eccentric characters

Their lives are shuffled between courses with some odd casting choices that somehow work, for example, Sandra Bernhard as a harpy food critic in a bad wig and John Corbett as a deceptively casual bar regular.Edoardo Ballerini is not particularly interesting as Udo, but Kirk Acevedo provides jumpy energy to Duncan, the sous-chef whose gambling debt has a domino effect on the rest of the characters


The mob angle is played up with stock characters embodied by Mike McGlone and Alex Corrado as two obvious hoods, and there is even a pretentious dinner party headed by a pompous art gallery owner portrayed with obnoxious languor by Mark Margolis

However, it is the hustle of the food preparation in the kitchen when the film really takes off, in particular, when Udo creates a sensational-looking, customized lobster tower for Bernhard's character


It's surprising that Giraldi has not made more films, but at least he sticks with his obvious passion and comes up with an often-interesting dish that I have to believe Anthony Bourdain would love.

$REVIEW.: On the eastern slopes of the Andes during the Spanish expedition , Gonzalo Pizarro urges his men to continue through the thick Amazon forests despite the dangers within the dark and humid jungle.  The tale of Pizarro's venture begins with an ominous warning as it is revealed to the audience that the only surviving evidence of the expedition is a journal kept by Brother Gaspar de Carvajal, a monk who travels to spread the gospel of Christianity.  This bleak foreshadowing induces an inching uneasiness into the mind of the audience.  This is enhanced by further looming incidents such as native slaves dying like flies from simple colds and food shortage.  The low supply of food leads to a decision to split the group where one group should return for provisions and the other should continue searching for a gold shimmering city.  This tale then follows the ill-fated who continue the journey for the legendary city as they are drawn deeper into the cruel world of the Amazon.  Deaths of several men forebode the grim future of the expedition, which the leadership wants to call off and return to the safety of civilization.  However, Aguirre (Klaus Kinski), a high ranking soldier, commands a rise against the leadership based on a proud vision of greatness and worldly riches beyond imagination that drives him to thrust deeper into the unexplored rainforest.  Aguirre's vision draws the expedition into a personal realm of madness and destruction, which leads to only one certain fate.Aguirre: The Wrath of God has a lingering effect on the audience as the eerie atmosphere created by Herzog persists from the initial shot to the final scene.  There are several components that generate this bizarre ambiance of the story such as cinematography, idiosyncrasies, mise-en-scene, and performances by the cast.  The cinematography is simple and sometimes documentary-like, which produces a real feeling.  This real feeling together with the uncanny knowledge of the unavoidable doom enhances the extraordinary atmosphere of the venture.  The complete portrait of the character Aguirre by Klaus Kinski is nothing but spectacular.  Herzog's choice of mise-en-scene is delicately chosen as all the items had to be transported by the expedition.  Each item within each frame displays a significant symbolism such as the horse and raft, which adds new layers to the unnatural atmosphere.  Lastly, the performances by the cast are outstanding as it is not the dialogue that drives the story forward, but the visual manifestation of their being that elevates the outlandish impression of each scene.

No, it's her performance that really put us off

His wife seemed not at all to be involved in purchase of their house.  What's that all about?  Fred Thompson showing up in one or two small scenes?  Why?  Who needed him? Did he need money that badley?  He's making more money telling old folks to give their homes away to unscrupulous speculators.  D'Onofrio will never live down this one.

$REVIEW.: This film was a spectacular film, with all of the nuts and bolts of Star Wars Romanticism.  Many critiques have been made about actors Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman's acting abilities, but to no avail.  You cannot argue that one of the best filmakers of all time would or has to allow "bad acting" in his films if he didn't intend for the characters he wrote himself to be portrayed the way they are in this film.  To the point, Lucas has enough money and time to make things exactly how he wants them.  And the claims that Lucas stooped to "sex appeal" (Amidala appears in a shoulderless, tight leather outfit) is completely untrue. Remember Return of the Jedi?  Princess Leah is in a metal outfit far more revealing than anything in this film.  Everyone has said that they hate Anakin, because he is corny, cheesy, and predictable.  I would like to argue that Anakin is meant to be hated, corny, cheesy, and predictable!  That is why he becomes Darth Vader in the first place.  I believe that Lucas made Anakin to be resented by the audience, a complete 180 from the way everyone likes Luke Skywalker.  The people who complain about this film are those who made up their own versions of what they thought it should be, and aren't letting George Lucas tell his own story.

$review_text.: The Hunger Games was everything I expected, but not more than that. I am a huge fan of the series, having read all the books months ago, but I've avoided the movie until all the hype died down, so that I could give an honest opinion, and here it is. The film was terrific, one of the best adaptation of a book I've read. Jennifer Lawrence was absolutely perfect as Katniss and if she doesn't get a ton of awards for the role, there is no justice in Hollywood. That's the good news, however the movie was far from perfect. Friends who went with me and had never read the books, found it to be slow, and didn't understand certain things. At times, I could see their point. Several major things were rushed or just left out of the film. This led to some confusion, and then there's Peeta. I love Josh Hutcherson and thought he was terrific, but the portrayal of Peeta wasn't accurate. He was nowhere near as likeable as he is in the books and he comes off looking like kind of a pussy. The end of the games was also problematic, as they changed a key point that I thought was pivotal going into Catching Fire. It will be interesting to see what they do to fix that before the next film. Overall I loved the movie and thought it was awesome, but if you didn't read the books, you might be a little confused by parts of it and see it as slow. Parts of the film that dragged on were explained through thoughts in Katniss's head during the book. Without knowing what was going on at those points, I could see how some audience members may have been bored with it. The movie and especially the books live up to all the hype and are well worth your time, The Hunger Games is something you are not going to want to miss.

Greg Kinnear perhaps has the best performance of all, yet went unrewarded.  The characters are well rounded and flawed, and the interaction is very realistic.  The DVD is beautifully transferred, but the commentary is very dry.  Definitely a nice edition of the film, but the extras are nothing special.

$REVIEW.: I don't understand a damn why people would give this a 'one star' review for the SOLE reason of stage lighting.Instead of bemoaning such, why not concentrate on the music?We have three solidly outstanding leads in this opera: Florez, D'Arcangelo and Machaidze.Let's begin with Nino Machaidze.I don't think she is a natural coloratura. However, she has GOOD coloratura technique.  Comparing her with Anna Netrebko in the same role, surprisingly Machaidze is much MORE convincing both vocally and visually!Machaidze's voice has not yet gained that requisite freedom of negotiation in passage work; that said, she sings accurately, cleaning, musically and FAITHFULLY.Not the same can be said of Anna Netrebko in her MET I Puritani DVD, alas.  Netrebko's passagios are muddled; her characterisation superficial.  Nino Machaidze is at least much more conscious of the role's mood changes and musical demands, and it shows in her performance.  As a very young soprano, she is one to watch.Needless to say, Juan Diego Florez is the major attraction for this release.  While not necessarily the best in Bellini (as compared to his Rossini), his is a sterling performance, and he looks every inch the part.  He also has a wonderful chemistry with Machaidze that Eric Cutler so sadly lacked with Netrebko in the MET version.D'Arcangelo is of course one of the major reasons why this performance is superior to the other MET one.All the three leads pour in committed and superb performances that makes this Bologna production worthy.The stage setting and direction are not comparable to the MET's, but the performance is far better both musically and dramatically.
$SUMMARY.: Musically superb, visually less so.

$REVIEW.: KILL YOUR DARLINGS seemed like the film for me out of all the slop I've seen released thus far in 2014. Imagine, an old Beatnik like me, acquaintance of Allen Ginsberg, huge fan of Daniel Radcliffe--and here's a biopic about Ginsberg, played by Radcliffe. DREAMLAND! ... I was right and wrong ....Well, to be blunt and sweet: the film hits all the right notes as an artistic/period production. There is something missing--Capotewas suffused with it (see my review), this wasn't--but what there is leaps out pleasantly. Set at the time when a young Ginsberg was just off to Columbia, the remainder of this is not so impressive. It is, to be perfectly frank, a huge bore except for the stunning performances.Radcliffe is growing as an artist, and I would expect to see him in something like this at this stage of his career. The problem is, this film should have been about theHowl and Other Poems (City Lights Pocket Poets, No. 4)trial, and about far more important things than it presents. Many will disagree with me: a reviewer must press on. This film is trivial, a showcase for some pretty faces (plus a woefully miscast Jack Kerouac).The story here, that of Lucien Carr's commission of murder, is one I know vaguely and did not want to know about any further. Hence the idea I always had that any film about Ginsberg would concentrate first onHowl, and Other Poems, then on the characters. This film is a yes-no proposition for me and I will be even more honest: I refused to watch any more of it after about 90 minutes or a bit less. I'd had enough, even Radcliffe's presence being unable to sustain me any longer.Get it if you must; there is no other film quite like it and as I said, it has value. Perhaps I am missing something and it is a great film ... but it will never be a classic, nor do I think it will even be remembered except as another Radcliffe jumping-off point.
$SUMMARY.: I'd like to HOWL at the dummy who picked this era of Ginsberg's life

$REVIEW.: "The Box" is a metaphoric and atmospheric film, to say the least. That it is meant quite seriously becomes obvious through the deliberately serious acting by Cameron Diaz in a role unlike any other roles she has played.A mother close to her son approaching his teen years, a wife faithfully bound to a brilliant scientist-husband who has not yet earned an elusive success, a teacher who inspires her students in non-traditional ways--Diaz plays each with aplomb, with serious intent. I always think of Diaz as the co-star of that Vegas movie with the handsome Ashton Crutcher and her partially fluff role. There is NO fluff in "The Box." This is a serious, even if freaky and strange, film about the nature of man/woman.When faced with a decision to push a button (no alerts needed here because the premise of the button is shown on every advertisement). We know she pushes it and that someone will die, but we don't know the consequences. Consequences...Wouldn't you just know that pushing a button to get millions BUT simultaneously causing someone's death would have consequences?The Prophet in the Old Testament warns  that there is nothing new under the sun--that we commit the same ol, same ol, over and over. "The Box" shows us that premise so clearly. It's the Garden. Here's the apple. Obey or eat it? We know that decision and those consequences, but a box? With a button? Causing someone's death? Didn't Eve's decision cause Death, more or less? Metaphor. Life is metaphor, symbol, virtual reality. This film is just a reflection.Diaz's character's decision is not arbitrary. We experience her day. We know she has this disintegrated foot which becomes part of the hallucinatory aspect of the film that contributes to the button-pushing decision. We know she is not a fluff character. This woman is a high school teacher who is discussing a Sartre play with her class when one of the students asks to see her foot. Oddly enough (as odd goes in this film), she removes her boot to show her foot. Cause-and-effect, cause-and-effect.Frank Langella plays the messenger, the delivery man, the executive's assistant who was struck by lightning only to become an other-ly type of human. He works for an-other, the "Boss." God perhaps? If it's God, it's that God to which some attribute evil. A loving God would not force such a decision on his creation. Except--the concept of Free Will. I could make either case that Diaz has free will or is fated (because of Eve's long-ago decision, or even God's Will that humans be disobedient so that he can show the Way back to obedience).Dear Reader, do you "get" that this is a twisted film, full of darkness but potential light, OR light until darkness (evil decisions) enters? We are born into a "box" of our physical bodies, we live in boxes (houses), we travel in boxes (cars), we are buried in boxes. Langella's character points out the box metaphor (easily discerned). Much like good and evil, the box reflects man's nature. Good or evil? Both? And the decision? It hasn't changed. Just the consequences.

$review_text.: I enjoy this film quite a bit.  I like the story.  I like the acting...the fact that everyone had fun making it is apparent.  Like one or two other men, I have a weakness for the female human body, which the audience is tastefully treated to throughout the film.  I like Elle MacPherson in it, even moreso after I found out that she gained weight for the role and pulled off a very decent performance to boot (also, I disagree with a previous reviewer that considered her looking anything but at her best; I think she looks fabulous with the less-anorexic look).  And finally, I like the film's underlying themes and philosophies and lighthearted tones, which reflect the way I also prefer to see the world and make for pleasant viewing.So why only three stars?  The DVD is frankly horrid.  The film is presented only in standard, not widescreen.  The picture quality itself is really quite noticeably poor (for DVD).  There are no language selections at all aside from English.  There are no subtitles available at all, for any language.  And although I'm not a stickler for extras like commentaries and documentaries (and in all frankness I think most people could care less), those that are really into them should note that there is nothing of the sort to be found here either, aside from three text-based cast &quot;biographies&quot;.  In essence, this DVD is nothing more than the movie itself, providing few of the advantages of DVD over VHS at all.  One thing that is, fortunately, included is a decent soundtrack; it is in Dolby 5.1.A very pleasant film overall, with a very pleasant story, and certainly very pleasant scenery, but a disappointingly substandard DVD release.

$review_text.: This so-called movie is the most pathetic attempt at parody, and comedy I've ever seen. I like to think that a parody should be a movie that has a plot that can stand on its own while it parodies a movie with a similar plot. This movie has nothing that resembles a plot. It literally could be chopped and hacked to pieces as it rightfully should be and most of the scenes could stand on their own as sketches, and very poor sketch comedy at best. This waste of money seems to be the brainchild of a group of so-called writers that got together and said that they were going to take scenes from Scream, and I Know What You Did Last Summer, among other recent horror movies and simply redo them in a funny way. The writers of this crap have it all wrong. You don't try to redo a scene from the exact work that you are trying to parody. What you should be trying to do is make reference to the scenes that you are parodying in something new that you have created. Watch Spaceballs, a parody of Star Wars, and you will get the idea. You break into your own story and then make comedic references to the work you are parodying. You do not redo the same exact scene and try to make it funny. It just doesn't work that way. It is incredibly sloppy. Scary Movie is garbage with a capital G, and not worth your money to buy, or rent.

$review_text.: I had watched this series on German television on my English speaking channel. I was never sure if I'd seen all of it. Now that I've moved back, I've been trying to find it again. Some of the Seasons I watched on videos from the library and eventually began looking for the other seasons online. I was happy to find them on Amazon.This series takes place in a small town in Ireland. I believe it's aim is to show typical everyday life through several diverse characters. A new priest comes to Ballykissangel. He's English. The community shows its reluctance to accept this person in many ways. For heaven's sake he's English!! It's great fun to watch the interactions. And then there's the priest needling his boss. Brian Quigley another character runs just afoul of the law and his two bumbling helpers add great comic relief. Other characters are just as compelling and believable.I have loved every moment watching this series. Especially the first few seasons. Other reviewers have said the last two seasons were not as fun and were not as well written. I agree that they moved slower and seemed a bit blander, but I enjoyed them anyway.Ballykissangel remains one of my favorite tv series.

$review_text.: On the heels of the extremely enjoyableRambo (Special Edition + Digital Copy)Sid the Elf decided to finally review Rambo III. Also, due to the recent oppresive heat wave that has crashed upon the North Pole, Sid halucinated and thought he was in an Afghan desert, so Rambo III just felt right. However, whileFirst Blood (Special Edition)andRambo: First Blood, Part 2were clearly good enough to recieve 5 stars from Sid, Rambo III fell short. Please note that we're talking about the movie here, not the trancendant Rambo III video game on Sega which would recieve roughly 38 out of 5 stars. As always, visit Sid the Elf's Movie World for the Rambo III trailer, all our reviews; and some of our favorite pics, sound clips and videos. If you don't crack up at least 10 times on our site, you don't have a soul. Ok, back to the review.This time, Rambo is somewhere in Asia living in a Buhddhist monestary--now this is true. And, the first appearence in the film by John J. is at a seedy Asian fight club. He is stick-fighting some guy who looks like he just missed the cut to be in The Samoans. Anyway, Rambo is eventually approached by his old mentor, played by Richard Crenna. He needs Rambo to help him out with a mission in Afghanistan against the Russians. Rambo declines and Crenna predictably gets captured during the mission. So, word gets back to Rambo and he decides to...yep, infiltrate the camp where Crenna is a prisoner and bust him out. Rambo gets some help along the way from Bilo and Bilo's son. They give him some stellar backup, ammo and teach him a new sport. Aparently, in Afganistan, the sport of choice isn't anything remotely cool. No, it's mounting a horse and carrying a gym bag covered in faux fur across a sort of goal line. "Like football," Rambo says. Um, yeah Rambo, kinda. This is one of the funniest and best scenes in the entire film. Not a good sign.Now, Rambo makes it to the prison camp. He has to take out roughly 78 guys by himself. But, he has the wonderful old explosive tip arrows, a grenade launcher, and a ton of other awesome weapons. This is great and all, but where were these things being stashed? Did Rambo carry them in his black wife-beater? Were they kept in Bilo's cage? It was just a distracting thought. As in all action movies, the hero has to take out the top bad guy after he takes out the top bad guy's henchman. These were the shining moments in Rambo III, well, except for gym bag-horse football. Rambo takes out the henchman in quite possibly the coolest way in action film history. The henchman has Rambo in a ferocious bear-hug. Rambo wraps some rope around the guy's neck, pulls the pins from the grenades hanging from the guy's jacket, gets out of the bear hug, and kicks the guy down a hole leading to a cave. So, as he's decending into the cave he freakin' blows up! This scene is absolutely awesome. Above all else, if you're on the fence about seeing Rambo III, see it for this scene. If you like action at all, you will love this part. Then there is the little matter of Rambo vs. the head bad guy. He was the warden of the prison camp, the Russian Drumgoole. So, this guy is in a helicopter and Rambo is in a tank. These two are moving towards one another, playing chicken, but neither swerve. Sid would love some feedback on this: When the helicopter and tank crash, is it actually realistic that the guy in the helicopter dies and the guy in the tank walks away merely dazed?Rambo III was a strange entity. It had no descernable plot, terrible acting, and the tired 80's theme of Evil Russians. But, it was a Rambo movie. So, you're guaranteed Stallone and an inordinate amount of explosions which make it watchable. This was an interesting point in Sly's career. Rambo III was preceded by Rambo II, Rocky IV, Cobra, and Over the Top. Impressive. His next film, after Rambo III, was the legendaryLock Up. Very impressive. But, after that, Tango&Cash;, Rocky V, Oscar(which bombed but isn't awful), and Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot. Wow. Nobody loves Sly more than Sid, except for maybe Santa, but this is just a laundry list of crap. Not good times for Sly. Did he and Frank try out their famous lounge singing act during this stretch? Anyway, thankfully Sly recovered and got back on track with...um,(scrolling through imdb feverently)...Rambo(2008) was good! We'll give that one to Sly even if it wasn't him in the movie, just some guy in a Stallone mask.

The affair they begin  despite her husband`s suspicions and what to do about it all.  It is a great build up for what is to follow.  I recommend this film wholeheartedly.I believe it is based on the old Barbara Stanwyck, Fred MacMurray film `Double Indemnity`.  Certainly there are some similarities but it is different too.The film was not shot in Florida despite its look.  Evidently is was shot in a freezing studio in the middle of winter.

$review_text.: This subtitled film gives a very good feel for everyday life in a nation that was  economically prosperous but ruled by a tyrannical right-wing dictatorship.  Within that setting, the "revolutionaries" are viewed as bickering non-violent intellectuals lacking a coherent strategy.  The dictator's supporters are depicted as repulsive thugs.  The conflict between these two groups provides the dramatic thrust of the film and is very effective. Some pointed lessons on the philosophy of advertising and morality are also central to the plot.

$review_text.: I'm still trying to figure this movie out. I got it mostly because I loved Lucio Fulci's great &quot;Zombie.&quot; House of Clocks was made for Italian TV and looks it. Bad photography, lighting, terrible performances and a script that makes zero sense. The story involves a large Italian villa filled with clocks and clock hands that turn endlessly backwards. An old couple murders a maid. Then three jerks--a gal and two guys--break in and mayhem ensues. The clock hands turn even more furiously backwards. I think it means that the past keeps coming back to this one villa but then you're confronted with a dead married couple whose bodies lay in coffins in the attic. They suddenly come alive. Then...oh, I can't go on. It gets so confusing that I may have to go back and watch it again. God forbid. For Fulci addicts only.

$REVIEW.: I was not sure at first if I would care for this film, but it turned out to be an excellent depiction of a true story of WWII.  A group of German officers, disgusted with Hitler and what he  is doing to their country, decides to assassinate him, blame it on the SS, and take over.  They hatch a daring plan to set off explosives during a briefing.  The main man in all of this is Col. Stauffenberg, played ably by Tom Cruise.  Disregard Cruise's personal life and focus on his stoic, determined demeanor as a man who is risking everything to save the country he loves from a madman.Nice production values also abound, with superb locations in Germany and crisp direction as well.

$review_text.: After the box-office bomb that was Joel Schumacher's Batman & Robin&#34;, back in Fall 1997. DC Comics and Warner Brothers decided that with the next &#34;Live-Action&#34; adaptation of the caped crusader to take a different route. From a live-action adaptation of the then current Batman cartoon, Batman Beyond with the creators Allan Burnett, Paul Dini and Bruce Timm involved to a live action adaptation of Frank Miller's iconic &#34;canonical&#34; origin to the Dark Knight, 1987's &#34;Batman: Year One&#34;  and was to be helmed by Darren Aronofsky (Pi, Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain).Around Fall of 2003, it was announced that writer, David S. Goyer (Blade 1-3, The Crow: City of Angles, Nick Fury 1998 TV movie) and at the time up-and-coming, Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia) reshape the Dark Knight and would retell his universe with 2005's Batman Begins.Batman Begins (2005):This was the movie that not only reintroduced Batman/Bruce Wayne and the character's universe to the going public, but also introduced and popularized the idea of making Comic-based films &#34;Realistic&#34;.The tone of Batman and of Gotham rang true to what comic creator, Bob Kane originally thought of back in 1939. This was a Gotham that we've never seen before in live-action; a city was corrupt to the bone, gritty and a shell of it's former self. Same thing goes with Bruce Wayne.Unlike the previous interpretation of the duality of both, this take shows the true trauma that Bruce not only suffered as a child when originally seeing his parents gunned down, but also showing that traumatic experience still haunted him as an adult. An adult that was fueled with hatred and going a far to use the same weapon that struck his parents down, on the culprit.With this reintroduction to the material, Christian Bale was casted as Batman/Bruce Wayne. A lot of bat-fans were going &#34;Wha?&#34;, when it was originally announced before production even started, but like Keaton as the tittual role in the 1989 Tim Burton film, &#34;You can't judge a book by it's cover&#34;. While I think he's a good Batman, his Bruce Wayne was phenomenal. Compared to the others that took the character as they're own, Bale actually acted like a playboy would in the real world.Now I'm gonna get this out of the way, Yes. He and Nolan overdid the realism when it came to Batman's voice. When Bale opened his mouth as Batman. I wasn't trembling in fear, I was laughing. Granted, I get why they went with this decision and yes, they did improve it by toning it down with the last film, but still it was an annoyance to an already amazing performance.Michael Cain as Alfred has got to be the perfect personification of the character to date. The way he interact with Bruce and the other characters in this trilogy felt he was really give it his all.The same could be said with Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon. It felt like the look and characterization of Gordon was ripped right out of the Frank Miller classic origin, Batman: Year One.Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox. He gets the job done, but feels like deja vu. Basically, it feels like Morgan Freeman as Morgan Freeman or in Batman's case, Morgan Freeman as Deus Ex Machnia.Katie Holmes as the love interest Rachel Dawes was basically good in general. In some parts, it felt weak but as a whole, she does the job done with the role she was assigned.Liam Neeson as Henry Ducard/Ra's al Guel was another stellar performance in this film. His interpretation was not only his own, but also felt like he did his homework on the character and was influenced by different interpretations of Ra's from the now iconic Batman: Animated Series from the 90's to the character's influence during the Danny O'Neil run of the Batman comic series.Cillian Murphy as Scarecrow was also damn impressive. His take on the character was another well-done interoperation of the character from the original source. When he's &#34;The Good Doctor&#34;, he does come of that one thinks is sane but in reality is down right nuts.The Director of the trilogy Christopher Nolan was a perfect choice to reintroduce the character and the universe. Not only does he pull it off with the material at hand but throughout the Whole trilogy, he make you feel for the characters and what has transpired with the story. The only complaint I've had with Nolan is that he doesn't know how to direct a fight sequence. While he improved with both The Dark Knight and the recently released Dark Knight Rises, that was the only catalyst with Begins.Main composer of the trilogy Hans Zimmer, did a phenomenal job with the soundtrack. With the character's themes and the overall &#34;themes&#34; of the movies separate plots, he really mixes it well.Batman Begins - 5/5The Dark Knight (2008):With the start of The Dark Knight we get to see Gotham in a better state, one that has never been seen before. That is until we're introduced to the Joker (Heath Ledger) and his plan for the &#34;fair&#34; city of Gotham? He doesn't have one. He wants to see it return to it's original state &#34;a cesspool for criminals and killers&#34;. Like  what Alfred said with the Joker's psyche &#34;Some people just want to see the world burn&#34;&#8230;While I still say my two favorites Joker's are both Mark Hamill ( Batman: The Animated Series, Batman: Arkham Asylem/Arkham City) and Cesar Romero (60's Batman TV Series), the way Heath Ledger portrayed this iconic villain from Batman's Rouge gallery was down right amazing. He made it his own character but took some cues from the comics, animated series and other media that the character has appeared in. In other words, He was the breakout performance and it was a damn shame that he passed away so young.The character of Rachel Dawes was re-cast in the sequel from Katie Holmes to Maggie Gyllenhaal. Honestly, I preferred Ms. Holmes as the character than how Maggie portrayed her. When some critics said back in 2005 with Begins that Holmes felt out of place in the movie, I felt that with Maggie. That she was both out of place but her acting was Highly wooden. When her character was killed off, I was shocked but shrugged it off a little later. This is when re-casting an already established character will hurt the film in the long haul.Another stellar performance was by Aaron Eckhart as Harvey &#34;Two-Face&#34; Dent. His portrayal was not only refreshing to what the common conscience remembers the character of from 1995's Batman Forever (ironically, a Batman movie I like) but one that is true to the character in general.The Dark Knight Rises (2012):It's been 8 years after the events of the previous film and we see Bruce as we saw Howard Hughes later in his life, a recluse a shell of his former self. Jim Gordon, the commissioner of Gotham Police has resigned during this time-skip due to his guilt of knowing the truth about Two-Face and falsely painting Batman as a killer. After Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) broke in the Wayne estate to copy Bruce's fingerprints, they fall into the hands of Bane! (Tom Hardy)Like the Joker in 2008's The Dark Knight, my favorites interpretations of Selina/Catwoman have been both Adrienne Barbeau (Batman: The Animated Series) and Grey DeLisle (Batman: Arkham City). And then Anne Hathaway happened. Ms. Hathaway's take of Selina is the breakthrough performance of this film. She's sarcastic, charming, beautiful, smart, I can go on and on but the bottom line is this, We finally have a Catwoman that is true to her comic counterpart!Another stellar performance was done by Tom Hardy as Bane. Unlike 1997's Batman and Robin, which was the character's big-screen debut. This interpretation of Bane is one that is right down to it's core, true to the comic original. unlike both Joker and Scarecrow, Bane was in the same plane on villainy as Begins' Ra's. He both has the Brass and Brawn to kill Batman if he wanted to. What I'm getting at is this, Bane is the first villain in this trilogy that shows Batman what he truly is, a vulnerable human being.Joseph Gordon-Levit as Det. John Blake is, in some ways, how we were introduced to Bruce back in 2005. He's a calm, collective cop in the force that holds to the same ideals that both Bruce and Jim once believed in. And in some ways like both Bruce and Jim, he to is a hot-head. I won't spoil it but when it's revealed who he really is, it's cool but like his character deducing that Bruce is Batman, it was one that was seen a mile away.The Dark Knight Rises - 5/5With the Dark knight Trilogy, I'll say this. While the Dark Knight Rises was the more comic book focused one, it's predecessor was more realistic/bank heist/drama focused. Batman Begins was the one that had the perfect mixture of the comic book mythos and the stylistic reality that this trilogy created and popularized in the comic/superhero adaptation genreFINAL SCORE: The Dark Knight Trilogy - 5/5

$REVIEW.: I'll admit that upon first look this film seemed like just another run-of-the-mill revenge action flick with mediocre writing and substandard acting, yet I was very pleasantly surprised by how deep and emotionally involving this film actually was! While Jet-Li has never been known for his acting talent, he shines here as young man is taken under bondage by his sleezy and greedy uncle who uses him as a sort of pitbull fighting dog, who makes his uncle vasts amount of money in underground street fights by keeping him sort of captive through the use of a electronic metal collar


How this collar works exactly is never really explained, but given how engrossing the film is, it doesn't really need to be
Danny also deals with a struggle with how his mother died and what exactly happened to her.Jet-Li's character Danny soon becomes separated by his uncle and gang and gets taken in by a blind piano repair man played by Morgan Freeman (who surprised me that he actually decided to be in this film), and his stepdaughter Victoria (played by unknown actress Kerry Condon who puts on an absolutely charming and adorable performance as a young and extroverted high school senior - you know, the sort of young woman every man dreams of finding and marrying..

really, she's that good)

All in all, Condon and Freeman steal the show, as without these two actors playing middle-class citizens in London just trying to get by this film would most likely just be another substandard washout
Jet-Li also puts on a surprisingly good performance as we see his character develop from a somewhat very shy and introverted mute to an more open and joyful young man who is reborn into a new life.Things soon get dicey when it is discovered that Danny's uncle is not actually dead as originally thought, and Danny's two worlds collide.While the film is only 95 minutes long, and doesn't really do anything that other films have already experimented with, it is the performances that keep you involved
Yes, there are some great action scenes and good fighting choreography in this, but what is relieving is that the fighting is not what is meant to keep your attention during this movie, but instead it is the characters and their relationships, their growth and emotional involvement
You come to care about the characters and what happens to them, you begin to feel bad and worried for Danny as well as his new family
This is just good writing.Now, sure this movie could have been better if the script was more tweaked and more time was put into the few plot holes that exist or things that aren't readily explained, the villains also could have been more "hate-able," and there could have been room for more sideplots involving the new family..


but really, as you watch the film, you just accept it for what it is and do come to like it

So in another sense, this film can't immediately be dubbed an "action film." While there is action in it (fairly violent at many points) there is good dialogue and drama, so this could be placed in the borderline action/drama category
The Unrated version is only 1 minute longer than the theatrical version (both version exist on the disc), and I'm sure plenty of brief violent scenes are restored, although I have only seen the Unrated version.As for the Blu-ray transfer, I must honestly say that it's pretty good, but not great

There is some grain that is left over so while the picture is good, it is no Lord of the Rings Blu-ray quality, but it is quite a few hairs better than what a DVD would be
The sound excels over the video as the audio comes out even across the entire film, and things sound plenty rich and crisp and crystal clear
I would say in some ways the audio in this film exceed many of the more mainstream Blu-ray hits
So definite Kudos for the studio on that one
As far as extras, don't expect anything, you don't get any behind the scenes or anything like that, but considering the price, you won't miss it.So for action fans this is a good pick up and flick to watch over the some dinner or with some friends

I definitely recommend it, even for those non-action fans.

$review_text.: This is my favorite movie of 2011 and my favorite sports movie of all-time! I saw the trailer to this movie around spring of 2011. My reaction was, 'This is probably gonna suck really bad when it comes out.' The more I watched the trailer, the more I couldn't help but find myself building up my anticipation to see it. I guess the reason why would be because I love movies and I love MMA! We all know most or all recent MMA movies suck and haven't really been taken too seriously due to the previous attempts like 'Never Back Down', 'Fighting'(Not sure if it's even considered an MMA movie, but might as well be.), 'Unrivaled', 'Undisputed' 2 & 3(Great action in these 2 flicks), 'Flashpoint', and 'Redbelt' which was pretty good and realistic but was more of a drama than an MMA or sports movie. Now 'Warrior' has all the elements to make it a great picture. It was one of those rare movies that had you expecting it to be really good even though something inside you said it might suck. Boy was I wrong and glad! Great story, great acting, great action, great music, and an awesome cast. Nick Nolte deserves an Oscar nomination for doing such an awesome job. I am officially a Tom Hardy fan now. Now the most important and favorite part of the movie for me was the conclusion before the credits. I haven't found myself seriously tearing up like that during or right after an action scene since 'T2' or 'Braveheart'. It was such a bittersweet ending when the song 'About Today' starts playing at the end when the brothers are fighting. I'm gonna stop here because I feel myself tearing up just thinking about that final scene in the movie as they're walking back to the locker room and the father is looking at them from a distance. WOW!!! It's almost impossible for me to believe that there will ever be a better MMA movie than 'Warrior'! Great job to director, Gavin O'Connor! Too bad I don't see the movie getting a Best Picture nomination due to the nature of the media and the public's reaction to MMA.

$REVIEW.: While I normally like these kind of shows, Prison Break was one of those kind of shows that always fits through the cracks. For every show like Lost or Heroes that manage to stay on the air, there's always those that get cancelled prematurely so I didn't bother to check it out. Not having anything to watch I thought I'd give it a shot. With season 2 nearing DVD release and season 3 on the way, it's nice to get a head start. While I wouldn't say it's one of the best shows on television right now, it's certainly one of the more entertaining and addictive ones.Most spend their life trying to stay out of prison but for Michael Scofield, he wants in. His brother Lincoln Burrows is on death row framed for the murder of the Vice President's brother and so it's Michael's plan to get into the prison as an inmate and with knowledge and a near full-torso tattoo of the prison's layout, sets in plan an elaborate escape. But that's not so easy as some inside the prison find out and want in while others outside the prison want to make sure Burrows is dead one way or the other.One of the strengths of a show like this is each episode gets you more and more excited about nearing the end as the story continues to leave you guessing. And with a show like this where every episode ends with some kind of cliffhanger, you'll find you keep putting on the next DVD to find out what happens. However that can also be the show's weakness as it's hard to re-watch the show since you know where it's going and how it'll end. It's good TV anyways although it's hard to tell if the show has lasting power if you already watch the whole season.One of the things you need to do when you watch is to turn your brain off just a tad. It's not a show where anything can and does happen but there's some many instances of coincidence or convenience that you just have to forget all of it and just go along with it. There's some trouble spots such as a big cliffhanger followed by a flashback show of all things and you start to get a little impatient at just how long it's taken to get to the breakout but then we have the last 3 episodes which are probably one of the more exciting season enders around.While Wentworth Miller and Dominic Purcell do admirable but not stellar jobs in their roles, the strength largely comes from its supporting cast from Robert Knepper playing the creepy pedophile "T-Bag" to "C-Note" to Scofield's cellmate, the likable Sucre who's suspicious that his girl will move on while he's in jail, it's easy to like the cast around them and root for them, particularly Knepper who somehow manages to be darkly funny yet a huge dark part you don't want to be near.It may be a bit too macho for some since not only is it predominantly male in its cast but in its tone, it's also compelling TV so why not?
$SUMMARY.: 4.5, fun addicting TV

It is great to see Mitzi at her prime and performing all the songs and dances and it is brilliant. Like the title, it is razzle dazzle all the way and a wonderful DVD to while the time during the Christmas season. I really recommend it for people who enjoy variety and light entertainment TV shows.

My three year old Paige loves Minnie so she was excited to see Minnie's The Wizard of Dizz!We had just watched Oz the Great and Powerful and Paige actually recognized the similarities in the stories. The story added an additional element of magic to an already magical show. All of our favorite characters from the Wizard of Oz were there but of course, played by more recognize able friends!Disney is always creative and this adaptation of an old beloved story that is once again popular is imaginative and so creative in all it's elements.Since Reed already got The Quest for the Crystal Mickey, Paige was excited to have her own "girl" DVD. Although they both watch each other's DVD's whenever I put them on so they are definitely great for both sexes. Even though Minnie is the star of this DVD, all of your favorite characters are there as well.Minnie's The Wizard of Dizz was a joy to watch and one that parents actually won't complain about watching with their kids!

$REVIEW.: The show needs no comment other than it is fantastic, essential, viewing. However, I am very disappointed in the packaging. It is poorly conceived, and even more poorly executed. The drawer holding the printed material is jammed and split, and the interior of the box that holds the DVD's is ripped all along one side. All of this was undetectable when the product was received, as the box comes factory shrinkwrapped, and the drawer is covered by a fold-over front flap. Other reviewers have clearly had the same issues, which, as has been said, are unacceptable for a set costing as much as this one does.In respect of the price, I paid $230 before Christmas, only to find that it is now $165! I appreciate Amazon agreeing to replace the set for me due to the damage, but the price drop does rankle somewhat. Amazon customer service flat out could not explain to me their pricing policy, so I guess all I can do is suck it up, and hope for the best with the packaging of the replacement set.

$REVIEW.: This movie had SO many cool action/shoot out scenes

 Clive Owen stars as a man who knows how to shoot and make the best use of a carrot

 He's a scruffy, ( but very handsome ) man who innocently stumbles upon a woman about to give birth

 Some bad guys start shooting at the woman and he assists in birthing her child, all the while blowing away said bad guys
 He protects the child from a really nasty head scumbag -playing against his usual, amiable and likable character type, by Paul Giamatti- and the body count climbs higher and higher
Clive enlists the help of a lactating prostitute ( the baby does need to eat ), and eventually a high ranking government/business consipracy is revealed

 Lots of action, blood and great one-liners/puns


 Oh, and the carrot bit.....you can pretty much take a stab at what Clive uses it for....

$review_text.: A small film done for television and it shows. Too many close-ups for one and the movements are so slow, including the final lethal accident, that they seem suspended in mid-air. And these moments of absolute concentration on one face with one expression that is stretched out to unbearable proportions are definitely too long.But there can be very good TV films? Sure, honey pie, sure, when David Lynch is the master of ceremonies.Now what about the subject? A university professor that makes himself academically and pedagogically available to his students. The film cheats at once and only shows girls. Of course such open relations with students can be verging onto flirting, with the girls or with the boys, or both. Students need to meet listening ears and professors need to meet mirror neurons that are going to mimic or mi-mock them. Sex is at times even the only thing they all have on their minds but they would never do it for a myriad of reasons.The wife is a gynecologist who has become frigid with her profession and she starts imagining for one thing among others that her late teenager nearly adult son is still a little boy who does not look at himself in the mirror and does not even know bees and birds have some kind of moss-life. Frigid I told you. Then she starts fantasizing her husband having an affair. So she hires a prostitute to approach her husband and test him.What had to happen happens of course and what's more the wife falls for the girl, and what's more the girl makes the boy trip and fall for her and even spend some good time in the mummy's bed, and mummy really is the right word.After a lethal accident everything will go back to normal. Three semi-strangers living under the same roof and nearly frigid to one another, estranged in all possible ways and only carrying on a life of boredom and dumb perversity. The husband will eventually assault a hotel maid and the wife will eventually have an affair with a female secretary of hers. As for the son he will probably be just as warped and twisted as his parents especially since he witnessed the lethal incident in his hastily put on briefs.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

$REVIEW.: Many reviewers have commented on how accurate Spike Lee's portrayal of 1980's college life in "School Daze" was


I cannot claim this, but having graduated college in 2006 I can say that I have seen nearly all of Lee's poignant scenes with my own eyes during my college career in the 00's
 In this sense, Lee has a gift for seeing things, writing about them and directing them so realistically on film

Not to mention the fact that his insights have obviously stood the test of time (well, at least 20 years)
The insanity of fraternities and sororities, the social activists on campus, the virgins, nuances of being a lighter skin African-American or a darker skin African-American, the sweet innocence of bringing someone to your dorm room at home (when your roommate is not there, hoping to get lucky!), the sports games (which Spike doesn't even show you the field, only the reactions of the onlookers), men teasing each other, woman teasing each other, the non-student townies wandering the streets


Spike's got this film jam-packed with the essence of college.Lee's father's music is once again in this film, which is great


The actors, are great


Everything is perfect, however not me.I can't quite explain it, but after watching this movie I thought, "Well, that was OK"
This is now, the second film of Spike Lee's that I have watched, and I must say that, if I did not know who the director was before I watched the movie I think that I would easily guess that this was made by a young person

A person who is still hoping to change the world by shouting, rather than by doing

For this, there is something about this movie that is annoying

 Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this movie, it was surely fun, entertaining and poignant to some extent, however I just can't seem to get over an air of immaturity
 But what am I looking for? Spike Lee is just over thirty when he made this picture
Before I talk smack about Spike, let's see what I have accomplished by the time I turn thirty! Enjoy Spike's second joint.

$REVIEW.: This is probably Michael Bay's second best film, behind the original 'Bad Boys' (the sequel to which is surely one of the very worst pieces of "cinema" I've ever had the displeasure of seeing). The reason 'The Rock' falls behind his debut is obvious: Bay can't, to my mind, produce any sort of convincing dramatic effect; what little emotion the movie does evoke comes courtesy of the outstanding cast -- primarily Cage, Connery, and (by far the most of the bunch) Ed Harris. 'Bad Boys', on the other hand, was much more suited to Bay's ludicrous, a.d.h.d mentality; it was bogus, but never strove to be anything more -- and it was fun, and funny.The concept of 'The Rock' is intriguing and unique, but the problem that reveals itself fairly quickly is that Bay uses it as a catalyst to throw in action scenes around every corner. I personally don't have a problem so much with the sequences themselves being ridiculous. The car chase scene, for example, in which Cage just happens to handle a ferarri (or lamborghini -- not really sure) like a professional driver of whatever sort, making his way through a circus-esque obstacle course of insane proportions, is beyond unrealistic. But hey, Bay's sense of speed and excitement, alongside Hans Zimmers' adrenalized score, provide for good, stupid fun. It's that, following this scene, the action just does not stop, and it's usually far less creative and ambitious. It's just quarrel after quarrel, gun fight after gun fight, and though Bay employs neat tricks here and there that make him a unique director, most of it ends up becoming monotonous and stale.I don't even know if the film deserves three stars, because it's so hokey and implausible, but, it must be said, 'The Rock' was one of my very favorite movies back in high-school. Bay was also one of my favorite directors at that point, in contrast to my general spite towards the man at the current place in time -- times have changed; it doesn't help that every film proceeding 'The Rock' has been fairly atrocious, either. But the fact remains the man has incredible talent at establishing a particular visual mood and is able to conduct a sequence of shots that provide a rousing, flashy response. The final standoff in the film, as well as the climactic scene of Cage injecting the holy needle into his heart as jets prepare to blow-up the island, is, in its own way, exhillirating and awesomely impressive. But you know what? 'Armageddon' has sequences as such laced with brilliance too, but in the end it doesn't matter much when the overall film is such a turd. 'The Rock' isn't a turd, but it's not one of the greater action flicks out there -- not by a long shot. To my 14 year old self it might be, but to my more evolved, rational brain, it ain't I'm afraid.

$REVIEW.: I'll be honest, I did not and will not purchase the set because I have all of these Royal Rumble events taped on VHS already


So therefore I do not know what has been edited or blurred out or what music has been altered.1998 - Royal Rumble this year saw the return of Mick Foley entering the Rumble Match under all three of his personas (Cactus Jack, Mankind, & Dude Love)
This is the first Rumble Match that gets "hardcore" as we see the chair swinging Cactus Jack and Terry "Chainsaw Charlie" Funk go off on one another, the Nation Of Domination members fighting each other, the Jeff Jarrett & Owen Hart incident, and everybody in the Rumble Match gunning for Stone Cold Steve Austin

Shawn Michaels and the Undertaker faced off in a Casket Match for the WWE Championship that led to HBK being out for four years & the ending with Kane lighting the casket on fire with the Undertaker inside to set up their match at WrestleMania


Other bouts from this Rumble includes Intercontinental Champion The Rock vs


Ken Shamrock, Vader vs

"The Artist Formely Known As" Goldust, Tag Team Champions New Age Outlaws vs

Legion Of Doom, and a Six Man Mini Match with Sunny as the referee.1999 - This year's Royal Rumble was a bit of a lackluster as the Rumble Match was centered by the Austin/McMahon feud as again everybody in the match gunning for Austin to collect the bounty McMahon placed on Austin's head


Also Chyna making history by being the first woman to enter the Rumble Match

But the match that stands out the most is the violent "I Quit" Match as WWE Champion Mankind vs


The Rock where Mick Foley took a dozen unprotected chair shots to the head


The rest of the card is pretty much below average as it holds Hardcore Champion Road Dogg vs


Bossman, Intercontinental Champion Billy Gunn vs

Ken Shamrock, X-Pac vs

Gangrel, & Woemn's Champion Sable vs

Luna in a Strap Match.2000 - The Royal Rumble came back to Madison Square Garden as it hosts a historic Street Fight between WWE Champion Triple H and Cactus Jack, Tazz making his WWE debut as he broke Kurt Angle's undefeated streak, and the first ever Tables Match as the Dudley Boyz took on the Hardy Boyz
The Rock won the Rumble Match this year as it was average at best while having some funny moments that includes Rikishi & Too Cool getting down and Funaki being eliminated the most times in a Royal Rumble Match and to include a special entrant from Bob Backlund

Also on this Royal Rumble card was the Triple Threat Match for the I.C
Championship as the Co-Champions Chyna & Chris Jericho went against Hardcore Holly, Tag Team Champions New Age Outlaws vs
Acolytes, and a Miss Rumble Bikini Contest where it has Mae Young flashing her "puppies" that scared the living heck out of Jerry Lawler and leaving everybody in the arena grossed out.2001 - New Orleans hosted this year's Royal Rumble Match with Stone Cold winning it for a record third time, Drew Carey making a appearence and eliminating himself, Kane being dominate like nobody else has ever been in a Rumble Match and eliminating a record of 11 superstars after entering at #6, the Big Show making his return, and the interaction between Austin/Triple H and Austin/The Rock
Other matches from this night includes WWE Champion Kurt Angle vs
Triple H as it was higlighted by the Trish Stratus & Stephanie McMahon catfight, Edge & Christian vs

Dudley Boyz for the Tag Team Championship, Women's Champion Ivory vs

Chyna in a match that led to Chyna re-injuring her neck, and a classic Ladder Match as Intercontinental Champion Chris Benoit vs
Chris Jericho.2002 - This Royal Rumble was highlighted by many big returns in Mr


Perfect, Goldust, Val Venis, & the Godfather with Triple H also making his PPV return and in the end winning the Royal Rumble Match


But the true highlight of the Rumble Match was the rookie Maven doing the unthinkable and eliminating the Undertaker
Other bouts from the night are Ric Flair also returning to PPV as he took on Mr

McMahon in a Street Fight, Edge vs


William Regal for the Intercontinental Championship, Tazz & Spike Dudley vs


Tag Team Champions Dudley Boyz, Women's Champion Trish vs

Jazz, and the Undisputed Champion Chris Jericho vs

The Rock.Overall I recommend this set
Only with one Rumble not being so good as the other four (that being 1999), this is a good set to add to your collection.

$REVIEW.: When Dracula returns from the dead to assemble an evil army of monsters, it will be up to a group of courageous young kids to save the world in THE MONSTER SQUAD! Following his cult zombie hit NIGHT OF THE CREEPS, director Fred Dekker sets off to create one of the most beloved children's Horror films of all-time, combining all of his own childhood favorites into a single film: Dracula, The Wolfman, The Gill-man, The Mummy, Frankenstein's Monster, and other ghoulish creatures. With the help of Stan Winston and other talented makeup artists, THE MONSTER SQUAD features incredible redesigns for each of the classic monsters, making them scary without driving away his intended audience. Tom Noonan is playfully naive in his role as the Frankenstein Monster, while Duncan Regehr stands out amongst the monsters with his flamboyantly over-the-top but menacing performance as the sinister Count. The Squad, itself, is perfectly assembled as well, with a range of talented youngsters that remind us of Sean Astin and the gang from THE GOONIES. They bring to life much of the innocent humor, including memorable lines like "Wolfman's got nards!" THE MONSTER SQUAD is fun for all ages, a timeless cult-classic when it comes to monster movies.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies

Though only half of it is English dubbed right now, the second half gets a lot more intense and the content gets a little dark despite being a light hearted shounen. The animation is pretty good, but the voice work is phenomenal. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys action, comedy and fantasy all tied up with a ribbon weaved with incredible storytelling, a tidbit of pg-13 style fan service and some heartwarming romantic notions.

$REVIEW.: This is the story of the last years of officer Bill Tighlman's life. For those not in the know, Tighlman was the most famous law enforcement officer of the Old West, making Wyatt Earp look like a greenhorn copper miner. Sam Elliott with his whiskey baritone and commanding presence really delivers here, from the first minutes (with Tighlman attempting to make a Hollywood film) to the bitter end of Tighlman's life.Expect a realism and genuine Western fun, though recall that this movie is set at the end of Tighlman's career, so Prohibition is an issue and there are no old-fashioned gunfights at high noon.Anyway, who cares? This film, though it sags at moments, is great fun for the whole family...if you keep in mind that it doesn't shy away from the violence of Tighlman's demented archenemy.

$review_text.: Let's see.  Let me get some readers out early: this film is better than "Iron Man".  Gone? Ok, for those left then.  This is a reading of the film, not a review of its entertainment value.  Hancock can solve problems in the world.  Not only crime problems (although we only see that kind here) but bigger ones.  Does he want to?  At the beginning, it seems not.  The same happens with the all powerful companies that Jason Bateman's character is trying to convince to donate something to the world.  They can do things to make a better life for everybody.  They simply don't want to.  They only care about themselves.  That's how capitalism works, you will say.  Ok, right.  But we have Hancock now.  He is here to stay, and at the film's end he is on the brink of taking his godlike status to hearth.  The bad guys in this film are not the petty criminals, but the corporations that laugh at the idea of giving up a (probably small) part of their profits for the rest of us.  If Hancock can fly to the moon, he can also cause a big change on the way things are conducted on this planet.  And that conclusion can only be found in the world of this film, not in "Iron Man"'s entrepreneurship, and not in the sad, sad world of equally "bored rich guy" Batman.  Hancock can secure "order and progress" (what seems is Batman's motto) but he also can change that order.  It received three stars from me because certain effects are overused, the back-story could have been expanded, and the consequences of Hancock's existence for the world are not explored.  The plot scratched the surface, but that is better than empty discourses about ethics, values, and chaos (you know about what movie I'm talking about, right?).  So sequel please? (Interesting how many negative votes I'm gonna get for this one).

$REVIEW.: Olmi's follow-up to the much better and more rewarding 'Il Posto', is an exercise in the old adage "absence makes the heart grow fonder" gone awry. Sure, the cinematography's gorgeous, the acting fine, the set structure near perfect and the male lead is perfectly cast as the worker sent away from his small hometown to work in Sicily, where his wages and status will improve as a result, but the characters and plot are severely under-developed, IMHO.My problems with this film are the fact that almost nothing happens for most of the movie, and the man's fianc&eacute; is a horrible beast of a woman who resents his opportunity for advancement - she would rather he stay in their little town and they live in poverty out of her petty selfishness and small-mindedness rather than see a bigger picture and a brighter future on the horizon.Too much sedentary down time makes this Italian neo-realist flick drag unbelievably until the love letters, tender and touching, are exchanged at the finale, but by then, I had a difficult time caring about the outcome. I believe the protagonist was too good for the woman who was ultimately going to make his life wretched, regardless of what he did after the final credits rolled. I infinitely preferred 'Seduced And Abandoned' for a similar neo-realist flick from the same time period, or 'Mama Roma', 'Umberto D.', 'Divorce Italian Style',  'Marriage Italian Style', 'Big Deal On Madonna Street', etc. over this one any time. "Absence makes the heart grow fonder", maybe, but only if I never sit through this one again.

$review_text.: Did a tour as a FAC with a TACRON (Navy) back in 70/71.  I'm now an educational counselor (after a 30 yr Navy career)for the military and have contact with combat vets constantly.  Got someone who's been in combat? WATCH THIS MOVIE!  I relate to the character and numerous others I've loaned this movie to have come back in tears - but good tears.  Bill Murray is the perfect Larry because of the fact that the humorous little boy continues to shine through, THAT'S WHO HE IS, in spite of what he's endured, the experience of watching friends die and knowing human nature in a manner of which only combat veterans and law enforcement people ever experience.  Larry stays Larry, he just changes in a manner that only another PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) victim can relate to.  It's my opinion that many people miss the depth of the character Larry and see only the exterior of the character.  Do you have to act like Budda or Ghandi to seek the meaning of life, the reason for you existence?  The whole point of the movie is that Larry is just an average person tossed into circumstances and situations that preclude him from returning to what his existence was "planned out" to be (work in an office/firm, get married, kids, summer home, etc, etc)- life's experiences and fate dictated his new journey - a journey he obviously was forced travel, with truth always just steps further away.Hey, could go on forever about this movie.  Just to say I understand my feelings and thoughts about Vietnam (and other experiences) in a completely different light after watching a man that reminds me of me going through the same emotions.

$REVIEW.: 'Boys Don't Cry'is a honest and at times sad story about the story of Brandon Teena. This film is charming, compelling yet the outcome is sad. What drew me to liking this film is the love story between Brandon and Lana. Hilery Swank did a fantastic, believeable job of portraying the ... identity crisis of Teena Brandon. Chloe' Sevigny was mesmerizing as Lana. There was fantastic chemistry between the two, and I completely understood what the director was saying. This is a important film that should be seen with a important massage. By Justine Ryan

$review_text.: The main difference here is that the director of this film got a more impassioned performance from Skaarsgard and cast than Paul Schrader
This fails mostly on the throwback reliance on Friedkinesque special effects


Sorry, but we did that already


Maybe on the large screen it came off better, but having watched Schrader's version first, I was convinced that it was the better story of the two


Much goes unexplained here, and in fact this film almost pre-supposes that you've seen Schrader's version for the background


There are huge gaps in why things happen in the sequence they do, and yet elipitical references are amde to film Schrader shot


Quite odd.On its own merits, everyone looks more involved in the picture

For Skaarsgard, he has a prettier, sexier Rachel to work with
This actress doesn't exude the guilt of the actress in Schrader's film, but she has asmoldering sexuality and a body to match


The reference to the Psycho shower scene comes off effectively


Ben Cross makes a cameo to begin and end the story that would have worked especially well in Schrader's film.And that's the odd part
Were you to select the better parts of each film, you would have had a really terrific thriller


Where this one falls down is the gore and goofy satanism
I can't imagine that Lucifer is that much of a dweeb.I watched both on Halloween, copied them onto my hard rive and hope to release my own synthesis in China in the next few weeks


That is the plan, anyway

$REVIEW.: Synopsis: We Were Soldiers tells the story of the first large-scale battle between U.S. forces and North Vietnamese, November 14-16, 1965, in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. The fight was also the first test of our Army's brand new "air mobile" tactical doctrine, which would become a signature of U.S. troop deployment in Vietnam. Lt. Colonel Hal Moore and 450 men of the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment (George Custer's old outfit), were inserted by helicopter into the Ia Drang Valley, where Army Intelligence suspected that North Vietnamese Army (NVA) units were headquartered. What Moore and his men didn't know, but were about to find out, was that several NVA divisions - numbering thousands of troops - were waiting for them in the Chu Pong Massif overlooking the Ia Drang. After three days of constant, fierce fighting and severe attrition to both sides, the North Vietnamese broke off the engagement and left the field to the Americans.The movie follows Hal Moore (Mel Gibson), as he prepares his green troops for Vietnam, then chronicles their bloody struggle at Landing Zone X-Ray in the Ia Drang. It also highlights the effect of the struggle on the families left behind, including Moore's wife Julie (Madeleine Stowe) and children.The Good: We Were Soldiers benefits from the talents of such likeable stars as Greg Kinnear, Sam Elliot, Barry Pepper, and of course Mel Gibson. It also devotes some time to the North Vietnamese view of the battle, which is unique and welcome.The Bad: An instructive comparison can be drawn between We Were Soldiers and Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down. Both are based on true stories of Americans who faced battles against long odds and prevailed through skill and courage. Whereas Black Hawk Down hews very close to its unflinchingly objective source material, though, We Were Soldiers pulls out all the stops to manipulate our feelings. Randall Wallace, who shanked one last year with Pearl Harbor, errs even more grievously this time with a cheesy script and heavy-handed direction. His players are good, but they can't save this one. Shame on Wallace for failing to do justice to Hal Moore and Joe Galloway's moving yet unsentimental account of the battle.The Bottom Line: The Vietnam War has produced a remarkable crop of great films. We Were Soldiers is not one of them. Read the book instead.

$REVIEW.: I am taking away one star because most of the "live" playing is on laptops (with a controller synth).  When I saw them live in 1998 they used actual synths throughout the whole show.  Okay once they found their style their live show was basically preprogrammed (they even tossed around the idea of having remote controlled robots play their music live for them) but watching someone play a laptop is far less interesting than a synth (which is the reason why most of the great electronica groups can't hack it live-see Do You Know Squarepusher for evidence of that).  However, the background videos that overwhelm the viewer more than make up for it. Some of them (such as the Model and Autobahn) use the same footage they've been using for years (using archival footage makes it more interesting with nostalgia for a past workshop of techonology).  However, the pieces off Tour De France (except for the title track) are not very creative and are only saved by the video footage.  And quoting anti-nuclear disasters in Radioactivity is an unnecessary piece of revisionism, the song was always anti-nuclear, its like the Cure leaving Killing an Arab off the re-release of Three Imaginary Boys. Other than that heck its Kraftwerk live(to an extant, I'm sure there was post production work on the music)and for a group that next to the Beatles were the most influential musicians in history, that is something to be thankful for.

$review_text.: So glad the Academy rightly ignored this film


 Bigelow always puts her garbage out strategically at the end of the year to be fresh in the Academy's eyes and steal an Oscar, like she did with Locker.First...I saw Bigelow on Letterman and she was such a jerk


 VERY arrogant  and acting all high and mighty and self-important


 Never really cared for her, but didn't hate her guts, but that Late Night interview made me hate her

 I tuned in to learn about the movie at the time, and she made me hate her guts in like 2 minutes


 Letterman would ask her stuff and she was all "OH that's classified, can't say BLAH BLAH BLAH."  Um, if it was classified, YOU wouldn't know, wench


 You are a stupid Hollywood wench, no one will tell you anything.But she acts like a witch - hate her


 Glad Cameron dumped her


 Bin Laden was probably killed years ago
 But her movies stink - she makes the same movie over and over - what will her next one be about?  Some other war?  INGLORIOUS BASTERDS blows away anything she's ever done

 Tarantino is a million times the director she is


 Hurt Locker wasn't even any good and didn't deserve Best Picture
 Renner is the only thing that made that movie watchable

 Bigelow makes boring, badly made, overrated inaccurate garbage propaganda


 I hate that overrated self-righteous jerk Bigelow
 She's ugly on top of everything too.

$REVIEW.: WHAT THE....??That was me for most of this dvd. The fact that the books this miniseries is based on were written by the Lord of the Flies author should have told me that I was not in for a laughs-a-plenty tale of adventure on the high seas. Rather, I was in for a strange and sometimes meandering lesson on how repulsive human nature can be. Which is fine. If you're looking for that. But if you're not expecting it, it's not a pleasant surprise!On the one hand, this is a well done miniseries. Well done as in great cast, great production and compelling script.On the other hand, I will never again voluntarily watch this due to the inordinate amount of vomiting, pant-crapping (or, more accurately, nightdress-crapping?), farting, and generally animalistic behaviour. Illuminating, but not fun to watch.Side note for fangirls: yes, you do see Sherlock in the buff - many times, actually, to the best of my memory...

$REVIEW.: Bruno Ganz is absolutely compelling in this performance of Hitler's final days.  There has been some criticism of this movie for tending to romanticize the doomed occupants of the final days in the bunker, but I disagree.  Although some of the charecters come accross as desparate, the contrast between those accepting their fate and fanatics loyal to end is dramatic and distrubing.  Ganz portrayal of Hitler is chilling - at times quiet and disinterested, and suddenly riping into subordinates with the fury of a madman.  The movie is in German and well it shoud be - you get the full effect of Hitler's mania.  Although the movie will appeal to WWII buffs, the movie is a charecter study of a tyranical leader and blindly loyal followers, all trapped in a fate that they created.  Highly recommended.

$review_text.: Contagion might be described as a "cinematic documentary" (oxymoronic, I know) that realistically imagines what might happen if a new, initially unstoppable virus sprang up and killed people on a global scale. The movie doesn't actually sound particularly unique from the outset, with quotes like "it's figuring us out faster than we're figuring it out", but when you think about it, most epidemic-themed films are completely fictional, while Contagion tries to paint a picture of what might really happen.The story mostly centers around Dr. Ellis Cheever (Laurence Fishburne) and Dr. Mears (Kate Winslet) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mitch Emhoff (Matt Damon) who is immune to the disease and must protect his daughter from society's collapse, Alan Krumwiede the amateur freelance journalist with a conspiratorial mind, and Dr. Leonora Orantes (Marion Cotillard), an epidemiologist sent to Hong Kong to find the origin of the disease.Most of the performances are solid and make you believe that what is happening in the movie is possible, as they react realistically to it. Cheever has to deal with the accusation that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is overreacting to the virus and he is also harassed by Krumwiede. He's an intelligent and affable person, be he makes some bad mistakes.I feared that the filmmakers might be trying to hard to give a "normal" perspective on things by including Matt Damon's character, but fortunately he sold the idea of a normal dad who has to become a desperate survivor in a dire time. Through him we can see a lot of how the contagion has a affected the masses, civilization committing suicide, if you will.The other two protagonists are the weakest. I like Jude Law, but his character is a cardboard "villain" who gets more and more inhuman as the film progresses. Marion Cotillard's story line is useless (sans the scenes that show us how the disease spreads) and disappears for most of the film, before returning with zero resolution. You must sit through these parts of the movie wondering what the point is.As the global situation worsens, people start rioting and looting and the like, and cities are quarantined. I felt like one or two sections where people started rioting were a bit abrupt, like there needed to be more build-up to show the insecurity of the populace, and then showing them finally snap and begin with the killing and destroying. But overall it's believable, and there are many sequences that portray the utterly ruined city littered with the dead. There is something intense about parts of this film, the cinematography and music combined with the believable premise and shots of the damage done. It constantly made me think to myself "What if this happened? What would we do? What would I do?"As great as it is, Contagion suddenly ends without ever coming to a point of absolute tension. The audience is suddenly sees how the contagion came about, though the characters are never shown to have learned this themselves. I could have used some more resolution to these character, who I had grown to care about, and perhaps to re-cooperation of the world. But Contagion just ends. It's great while it lasts though. It want to give it a 9, but it falls just short.8 out of 9

The most impressive character was probably the hero, though


He was so stuffy and stoical at first, but as he felt more compelled to get to know the heroine and was drawn to her, he softened up quite a bit
It was aggravating how she doubted him so much, but I was delighted when she started to see that out of love he had helped her family numerous times to save their reputations, etc

$REVIEW.: Seriously, I'm a big fan of Lizzy Mickery and Daniel Percival for The State Within, to which I've given 5 stars

But in this production of The 39 Steps, the writing and dialogue-editing together undermine any sense of depth or feeling of urgency in the main character; if we don't care about the character, we hit 'backspace' and look for something else

Sorry to say...

$REVIEW.: I'm not even going to bother nitpicking about how inaccurate the dinosaurs are or how rough the picture quality is; it was 1925


 There is no point in comparing it to a modern film


 For those who insist on complaining about the unconvincing dinosaurs: This was one of the first feature-length movies to employ stop-motion animation


 It was the first movie to combine stop-motion animation effects with living actors
 Cut it some slack

 (It was also shown as the first in-flight movie.)It's _Jurassic Park_, Version I.I'm aware that the plot of this film was panned even when it was new, and it deserved it
 The story line is somewhere between weak and nonsensical
 There are some unpleasant racial stereotypes that, unfortunately, were more common at the time
 The filmmaking is beyond dated; the movie was released in 1925 so that shouldn't surprise anyone.The stop-motion dinosaurs look like home movies in comparison to today's computer animation, but they were state-of-the-art at the time and are still surprisingly effective if you watch the movie with the technological limitations of the silent era in mind and are forgiving
 Even if the movie itself is unimpressive by modern standards, it's very interesting from a historical perspective.

$REVIEW.: This is based on the life of David Helfgott, an Australian piano prodigy who escaped the stifling influence of his strange, domineering father to attend the Royal College of Music in London. Apparently he was always  eccentric, but his career was cut short by a mysterious seizure that turned  him into a chain-smoking, shuffling, manic-mumbling, confused person who  spent years institutionalized. Eventually he wandered into a piano bar and  was re-discovered.

$REVIEW.: "The Social Network" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: On a fall night in 2003, Harvard undergrad and computer programming genius Mark Zuckerberg sits down at his computer and heatedly begins working on a new idea. In a fury of blogging and programming, what begins in his dorm room soon becomes a global social network and a revolution in communication. A mere six years and 500 million friends later, Mark Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire in history, but for this entrepreneur, success leads to both personal and legal complications.The cast led by Jesse Eisenberg (impressive as Mark Zuckerberg), Andrew Garfield (excellent as Eduardo Saverin) & Justin Timberlake (terrific as Sean Parker) is brilliant! The directing by David Fincher (who also directed "Alien 3" (1992), "Seven" (1995), "The Game" (1997), "Fight Club" (1999), "Panic Room" (2002), "Zodiac" (2007), "The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button" (2008, for which he received his first Oscar nomination for Best Director) & the upcoming remake of "The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo" (2011) is brilliant! The Oscar-winning screenplay (based on the book "The Accidental Billionaires" by Ben Mezrich) by Aaron Sorkin (who also executive produced) (who also did the screenplay to "A Few Good Men" (1992, which was based on his play), "Malice" (1993, story & screenplay), "The American President" (1995, story & screenplay), "Charlie Wilson's War" (2007, screenplay) & the upcoming "Moneyball" (2011, screenplay), he was also the creator and an executive producer on "The West Wing" (1999-2006) is brilliant!The Oscar-winning music by Trent Reznor (who is well-known for headlining the rock group Nine Inch Nails) & Atticus Ross (who also did the music to "The Book Of Eli" (2010) is brilliant! The cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth (who also did the cinematography to "Fight Club", "One Hour Photo" (2002) & "K-19: The Widowmaker" (2002) is brilliant! The Oscar-winning film editing by Kirk Baxter & Angus Wall (both of them did the film editing to "The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button", for which they received a Oscar nomination for their work for Best Film Editing) (he also did the film editing to "Panic Room" & "Zodiac") is brilliant!

This is a well-made film that is better than most of the films out there, recently. David Fincher & Aaron Sorkin are at the top of their games on this one. This is one of their best films, if not, the best film, of their careers, thus far. This is also one of the best films of the year and it is a film that will be remembered when Oscar time comes around.

$review_text.: COMES A HORSEMAN is a romance wrapped in a western.  The local cattle baron (Jason Robards) wants to drive out rancher Jane Fonda, who has hired on local wrangler James Caan to help her make it through one more hard year.  Complicating things in this World War II era tale is the oil company that wants everybody's land.With some truly beautiful wide angle photography, a plethora of establishing shots and a dearth of tight close ups, COMES A HORSEMAN is an more an actor's than an editor's movie that works as well as it does because it has an excellent cast at the top of their game.  Director Alan Pakula often pulls the camera back and allows his actors room to discover their character and the meaning of the scene.I only had two problems with this movie.  I felt the ending, the final confrontation between bad guy Robards and good gal Fonda, was a bit contrived .  The other problem was a puzzler - weren't their any doctors in cattle country America in 1945?  A couple of characters get busted up pretty badly in the course of things and they're dumped into a bed with a damp handkerchief on the forehead with nary a doctor in sight.  It didn't bother me much when Caan was laid up without professional medical care, but I hated to see poor Dodger (Richard Farnsworth) treated in such a manner.

Out of sunrises and into sunsets, through rainclouds and thunderstorms, past geysers and avalanches and collapsing icebergs, under trucks and over boats.The music fits perfectly, a la Disney's Fantasia, but it's the magical photography (and the wonder of birds) that really makes this film fly.

$REVIEW.: Star and I watched this animal story


 She not only watched the cats but was riveted to the talking dogs, too


 Only once previoously has my cat, Star, aged eleven years, looked at anything on t.v

 One Sunday she watched all of Sagwa the Chinese Siamese animated show


 But she liked this motley crew of talking dogs as they plodded against felines of her kind.When the hound went around in circles attempting to catch his own tail, I laughed so much she left her favorite chair to console me


 After that, I had to temper my enjoyment of this assorted group who learned of the ancient Egyptian fascination with cats from a book.The cats had no faces, only pug noses and lots of fur -- maybe that is Persian


 They were the strangest looking cats I ever saw, must be Japanese


 Star has a very pretty face and is short-haired
 Some weird alien cats arrived (and left) in kamisake planes to attack the hound dog

 These weird fat cats resided with a comatose factory owner

 Watching them drive his black limo and propel him around wired with several IVs as they gave orders for the workers to abandon the Mason factory, it was quite something.The stray, a greyhound, was evocative to the puzzled hound

 These dogs had decided they were Russian spies

 A conference of dogs takes place  similar to a Russian agency something like our United Nations

 On Canine News Network, we heard Wolf Blitzer heralding a Revolution against the human race.The cats took over the Mason factory and captured the hound's human family as hostages to secure a potion to make humans allergic to dogs

 The leader uses a World Domination booklet to indoctrinate the mice on how to infiltrate the sewers to infect human existence.The dogs save the day and the scientist's family in the midst of a fire
 As the cats maneuver heavy equipment in the factory, the hound jumps through the air like Mighty Mouse to &quot;here to save the day.&quot;  He exits the inferno in falling snow to discover his valuable place in the family.The big fat white cat ends up modeling outlandish outfits made for him by a foursome of sisters in a big house, seemingly a fate worse than death.

$REVIEW.: Bill Cosby is as fine a comedian as he is an activist, who also made some of thegreatestshowson television

 Sidney Poitier is a well-respected actor, who broke racial barriers with his stellar performances in the late-60s movies


 Together (with Poitier in the director seat), they couldn't make a ghost comedy work
 I wonder if this was just bad timing that "Ghost Dad" was released in the same year as when thatironic Patrick Swayze tearjerkercame out (a zillion-times better movie, I might add)
 If this movie had been pushed back a year or so later, it probably would've been well received by the audience, but if that's the case, than the same could be said for "Over Her Dead Body"
 Alright, "Ghost Dad" isn't worse than that Longoria ectoplasm, but it didn't make me spirited away in good terms.Part of the reason for my lack of enthusiasm is the way the film used the premise

 Cosby's character was killed when a satan-worshipping taxi driver crazily drove themselves off the bridge, which was quirky in a way, but there was a series of gags before it where he avoided very elaborate death traps; since this circumstance is also an elaborate death trap, it was disappointingly predictable


 Once he became a ghost, that's when the film is full of rotten Jello pudding

 According to the film, when Cosby introduced his ghost self to his kids, he can only be seen if there aren't any lights around him AND he can only talk through telepathy

 The movie is largely inconsistent on the whole seen-by-darkness aspect, since there are many scenes when he's surrounded by sunlight or even active lamps and he can still be visible to the living; as for the telepathy, while I'm not a pro on the subject, he doesn't really need to use his mouth to form audible speeches to the family who knew he's dead, and I doubt he can juggle telepathic speaking with physical action without flubbing it up
 And then there's the reveal that he can just jump back into his old body whenever he likes, which is probably the most contrived and implausible plot device just so the movie can have a happy ending.But there are other things about the film that bugs me besides just how loose the movie's concept of a ghost is described

Bill Cosby's character is established as an uncaring, overworking soon-to-learn-his-lesson-by-laws-of-probability father, who often yells at his character for distracting him or disregard their special days in the most asinine ways (a hat with shaving cream on top as a birthday cake...really?)
 Trouble is, Cosby isn't convincing at playing such a character
 He has that SAME speaking HABIT of the EMPHASIZING of words and the PAUSES and the WEIRD shifting tone of his, and the faces he makes made him incapable to see him as an assertive, unruly father
 And then there's the children of the film, who seem way too humble about the fact that their daddy is dead, and soon they'll have to fend for themselves
 There's no sense of love or care in their interactions, they're incredible whiny and selfish for a good majority of the film, like the father's death isn't really a big deal
 All played for laughs, I suppose, but that's the issue I had with this movie: it's mocks the very subject of death.There's a sense of neglect and false wholesomeness surrounding "Ghost Dad"

 When I think about the circumstances that happened within the film, it's actually very morbid
 The movie made it seem like it had a happy conclusion, but certain events preceding it meant the family is actually worse off in the end than they were in the beginning; without spoiling it, let's just say they'll be begging for food stamps


 You can't make a happy ending out of those grim prospects.

$REVIEW.: We received this movie from Netflix by accident, so we decided to give it a try.  Simply put, this movie is so weak that we had to bail out after half an hour, rather than wasting even more time by finishing it.There's plenty of action, the special effects are good, and there's eye-candy for the guys.  But the plot is utterly juvenile and the acting is weak.  The actor playing the lead character is particularly bad.If you're a 12-year-old boy and you like blowing things up, you might like this movie.  Otherwise, be sure to skip it.  I'm giving it 2 stars (rather than 1) only because of the special effects.

Who can be trusted?  ...I dunno.  It's like my old roommate used to say:  "I don't trust anyone except me and you, and I'm not too sure about you."Good production values and acting make up for a story that kind of meanders around.Rated R for "some violence, sexuality, and language".

The way the story unravels through the persistant digging by the reporters is very exciting. The focus of guilt keeps shifting and keeps you on the edge of your seat. This works better as a movie that you watch all at once, rather than the episodic treatment currently seen on BBC America. I recommend the DVD.

Hill Harper's character is days away from marrying his beautiful fiance Charli (Zoe Saldana) when Charli runs into her former fiance and still aspiring actor Cool. Cool's reappearance in Charli's life makes her rethink her pending marriage. It's not that this is a completely horrible story, but the story line and production are average at best. These movie is slow in parts and contains out of place comedic scenes that border on buffoonery. Too bad for these amazing actors and some of the other good African American characters in this film.

$REVIEW.: In the concluding season of Red v/s Blue, Rooster Teeth has stayed true to its original characters and added some new characters that are outrageous enough to establish themselves in just a few short scenes.  There is no doubt that these new characters will give the writers plenty of ammunition for future projects.  Season Five has everything; love (or lust in Tucker's case), hate, mystery, intrigue, triumphant acts of courage, heartbreaking death of both human and AI.  Of course there will be sweet laughter at someone else's expense.The ending left me a little cold.  At first I didn't believe it did the characters or the previous season's justice; but after listening to the commentary on the DVD, I believe the ending chosen was the best choice.  Thankfully, this is the ending of the series and not the ending of all the characters we've grown to love in Red v/s Blue.Caboose rules!

$REVIEW.: In THE DOOR IN THE FLOOR, we have an older woman seducing and sexually exploiting a teenage boy
Since the older woman is the spitting image of Kim Bassinger, how lucky can a guy get?Author Ted Cole (Jeff Bridges) and his wife Marion (Bassinger) live on the seashore in the East Hamptons with their daughter Ruth (Elle Fanning)
The couple had also had two sons, but they were killed as teenagers in a particularly gruesome auto accident


Since then, Marion has withdrawn emotionally from her husband


It doesn't help that Ted, also a sketch artist, has sordid sexual affairs with his models, mostly local women drawn to his fame as a writer of children's books


So now, Ted and Marion begin a trial separation, the two alternating solo nights at home caring for Ruth with stays at the "apartment in town"


In the meantime, Ted hires a high school junior, the 16-year old Eddie (Jon Foster, resembling a very young Ryan O'Neal), to help with the editing of his next book

Eddie immediately falls in lust with Marion, who subsequently seduces him with minimal effort, and who, by Eddie's reckoning, has coitus with him 60 times by the film's end.THE DOOR IN THE FLOOR has manipulation as its theme; Ted and Marion manipulate Eddie and each other


Eddie is the innocent party here, though it could be argued that sleeping with another man's wife isn't blameless


For his part, Ted wants custody of Ruth if his troubled marriage leads to divorce, so he hires Eddie, who resembles the oldest, dead son, knowing the attraction he'll have for Marion, and vice versa

Ted wants Marion to have an affair with the boy, thus rendering her judicially unfit to be a guardian
On the other hand, Marion freely admits that having Ruth was a mistake, so perhaps she doesn't want custody anyway; her seduction of Eddie certainly seems calculated
Indeed, she wonders out loud if her oldest son ever had sex before he died, and substitutes the virginal Eddie for the former in her own private Sex Ed class.This film has a superficial resemblance to 2004's CLOSER in that it's about adults assaulting one another using sex as the weapon

While the emotional violence in the latter is more spontaneous and heated, here it seems coldly calculated


The dramatic tone is better maintained in CLOSER, however


THE DOOR IN THE FLOOR includes a slapstick sequence wherein Ted's current mistress comes after him first with a carving knife, than an SUV

While this provides the audience with comic relief, it mars the film's consistency


For that reason, I'm subtracting a star.Ted and Marion are two world-wise grown-ups emotionally exhausted with each other probing the limits of their residual relationship and seeking justification for the ultimate break-up, and Eddie is the means to an end

While I'm not an avid fan of Jeff Bridges, I've seen enough of his screen characters to suggest that this is perhaps his most complex and nuanced role to date

It's a performance worth an Oscar nomination

Bassinger's Marion is perhaps too controlled a character to provide the substrate for a great dramatic performance, but, at 51, Kim is still a Hot Babe, and that's enough for me.

$review_text.: Don't expect a lot from this DVD, it offers just two buttons for you to touch: &quot;View trailer&quot; and &quot;Play movie&quot;. No scene access, no special features. Yea, that's sad. But the film itself makes up to what's missing on the DVD. Melanie Griffith gives a superb performance as a schizophrenic ex-girlfriend and distressed mother. You'll love the nostalgic scene of her and Patrick Swayze, from different corners of the world, watching &quot;The Hustler&quot; on TV and getting lost in their memories. And the fabulous musical score is definitely some &quot;bonus material&quot; to this romantic drama -- especially the last song (&quot;Say Goodbye&quot;, written by Serge Colbert, Mark Portman &amp; Alan Rich and performed by Lauren Kinkade). That melody, along with Griffith's childlike smile, will surely capture your heart.

flash foward to the 80's and after a long time the school has another prom,so guess what,right the killer is back

$review_text.: There aren't enough superlatives to descirbe this collection.  Within a span of 20 years, we have the best expamples of the best actors and actresses all in one huge story.  It is so amazing that almost 30 years since I viewed the first Godfather when I was only 16 years old, that I am still amazed with this saga.  It only goes to show that good movie-making transends all generations and time.  Francis Ford Coppola is without a doubt, the most prolific movie-maker of our generation.  Many Scorsesse buffs may refute this, but, none of Scorsesse's flicks can hold a candle to the Godfather Collection. The movies must be watched in the order in which they were made...never mind the sold-called Saga which re-edited them.  Each one of the individual movies themselves is a story within itself...and, produced as such.Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duval, all are the most important actors of our time.  I do not see any inkling of the brilliance of these performers in any so-called movie-stars of our time...and, I have tried and tried to find some sort of greatness in today's actors which comes close...I haven't seen it yet!.

$review_text.: &lt;strong>Cleaner&lt;/strong> (Renny Harlin, 2007)The fact that Renny Harlin has made some of the worst movies in recent memory (&lt;em>Exorcist: The Beginning&lt;/em>, &lt;em>Cliffhanger&lt;/em>, &lt;em>Deep Blue Sea&lt;/em>, and &lt;em>A Nightmare on Elm St


4&lt;/em> were all Harlin projects) tends to obscure the fact that sometimes he puts out a serviceable, if forgettable, thriller
&lt;em>Cleaner&lt;/em> is one of those, and if it's muddled, overly complex, and kind of silly, at least it's not &lt;em>The Adventures of Ford Fairlane&lt;/em>
Yes, Harlin was responsible for that, as well.Tom Cutler (Samuel L


Jackson) is a police detective who got out of the life and started a crime-scene cleanup business
Everything is going along just fine

Well, okay, "fine" is not the word

His employees are having problems dealing with the messes they're being asked to clean up, he's a single parent with a rebellious teenager, and his hot secretary hits him with two jobs that need done while he's the only guy in the office: an old woman with forty-five cats who died of natural causes and a run-of-the-mill homicide
He takes the latter
(That the former is never mentioned again is the movie's single biggest failing.) Everything goes as scheduled until the next day, when he realizes he's forgotten to leave the keys, so he goes back to the house to return them..
and Ann Norcut (Eva Mendes), the homeowner, knows nothing about a cleaning company being retained to sanitize a crime scene

Cue web of deceit.The biggest draw here is that you've got four actors with proven track records (along with Jackson and Mendes are Ed Harris as Tom's ex-partner and Luis Guzm&aacute;n as a detective investigating departmental corruption), and all four of them deliver good performances
A number of other solid actors turn up in smaller roles; the Robert Forster cameo is worth the price of admission by itself.Balancing that out is, well, Harlin's direction, which is about as lackluster as it usually is when he's not in stuff-blows-up mode, and Matthew Aldrich's script, which doesn't do quite enough in the way of jacking up the suspense or hiding the predictability

It's got some really nice touches (the movie's opening scene is fantastic; if Aldrich and Harlin had been able to keep up that level of humor/gore mix, they'd have had a hit on their hands), but the longer we go, the more the movie fails at keeping the viewer guessing, despite the actors doing the best they can with the material given.Short answer: Harlin's best movie since &lt;em>Die Hard 2&lt;/em> seventeen years previous..


but not as good as &lt;em>Die Hard 2&lt;/em>, which wasn't great in the first place
** 

$SUMMARY.: Wow, Renny Harlin is still capable of making a decent movie!

$REVIEW.: I've often said that Cinderella 2's biggest problem, when you get beyond the fact that it was clearly made purely for kids and is really just another form of  princess "merchandise," is that it was falsely advertised to increase sales. Disney does that quite often with their direct-to-video releases, and it makes it difficult to distinguish the good ones from the bad before buying or renting. And, make no mistake, Disney DOES make some very good direct-to-video releases. Cinderella 3, for example, is an excellent film. Cinderella 2... not so much. It's the title that's the biggest problem for the consumer though. "Cinderella 2: Dreams Come True" implies some grand, feature-length sequel to the classic Disney film. In fact, that is nothing like what you actually get here. Again, for something like that, I recommend "Cinderella 3: A Twist In Time." Cinderella 2 would have been better titled "Mouse Mouse Tales" or "Tales From Cinderella's Castle." See, that's all it really is. It's three tales from the mice that were Cinderella's best friends since before she became a princess.In truth, the stories really aren't that bad. Okay, the first one is kinda weak, and it's the one that is the most about Cindy herself, but the other two are pretty interesting. The stories are introduced by the mice and the Fairy Godmother as they work to make a gift for Cinderella, a book she can read to them about their first experiences after moving into the castle. Something I found a bit odd in these sequences was how these storybook-period characters had access to Crayolas and number-two pencils. The first tale is about Cinderella struggling to do things right in the castle in preparation for a ball and finally realizing she must do things "her" way. The Second story is about Jaq the mouse making a wish to be a human so that he can be more helpful to Cinderella. Of course, by the end of the story, he learns that he's better off being a mouse. In the third story, Cinderella plays matchmaker for her apparently not so bad stepsister, Anastasia. Anastasia has fallen in love with the village baker, and he with her. It's probably the best story, but in the sad tradition of Shrek and OTHER films, in teaching its moral it also teaches that unattractive people belong with unattractive people, and beautiful people with beautiful people. I'll jump for joy when one of these films gets the anti-superficiality statement right! Oh, and Lucifer the cat makes a deal with the mice to help him win the heart of Pom Pom, the palace feline. Naturally, that doesn't work out.While the film is watchable, depending of course on how much you love animation and how much quality is necessary in said medium to hold your interest, it all feels like a long episode of an animated series aimed at a very young, female crowd. The songs are atrocious. They're not good and they don't fit! The voices don't do much to recall those in the original film, especially Cinderella's and the Fairy Godmother's. The mice are fine but speak too clearly in comparison to the original film. Cinderella is out of character at times (seems more like the more recent Disney princesses), and the film does nothing to help us get to know Prince Charming more. As for the animation, well, while the characters are recognizable, they are extremely flat and without style. It all basically looks like TV animation. Sometimes good TV animation, sometimes bad TV animation. Overall, it's a cheap Cinderella experience to recruit younger consumers and maybe provide a little enjoyment for those fans of the original that aren't too particular about quality or substance. "Cinderella 2: Dreams Come True" isn't without its entertainment value, especially for small girls or fans of Cindy's mice, and surely it's a must for the completist collector, but if you're looking for something really good to compliment the original, go for "Cinderella 3: A Twist In Time." It's not perfect, and the very first moments might make you worry, but if you give it time, you'll find it to be a wonderful experience. Cinderella 3 succeeds nearly everywhere that Cinderella 2 fails.As for the extras on Cinderella 2, they're nothing to write home about. There's a simple game that basically lets you experience what it's like to be Cinderella. You have to clean up parts of the castle. It's actually kinda fun, but I can't imagine playing it more than once. There's a DVD-Rom activity called "Cinderella's Doll House Game," but I don't bother with DVD-Rom stuff. You also get a music video of one of the horrible songs set to clips from the film and a featurette on the film's awful music. Finally, there's a pretty lame Cinderella story that you can have read to you or read by yourself. Yeah, the extras are pretty awful on this DVD. Still, as I said, it's okay if you just have a Cinderella fanatic in your home that doesn't require everything to be feature film quality. If you ever had the desire for a Cinderella animated series, this might be welcome in your DVD collection. Myself, I am a Disney fanatic, and I love their gorgeous princesses, so owning this is simply a must, even if it is disappointing on many levels.

$REVIEW.: I am very impressed with this movie.  It addressed an issue of major importance in a time when that was "just not done".  It is sensitive and moving.  It does not condone nor condemn, it simply tries to present an objective view of a very serious issue - AIDS.The acting was well above average.  The emotions and fears of everyone involved were extremely evident.  It drives home the circumstances in life that these people had to deal with.It also allows us to look back to 1985 and see just how far we have come with the treatment of AIDS.  The facts presented were certainly relevant and "right-on" for the time.  It also allows us to see the courage it took for the actors and networks to produce and broadcast this movie in a time when it could have back-fired.  It has the same message as "AS IS" and "Longtime Companion", but presented in a very different manner.  I strongly recommend this movie if you want to try to honestly and objectively understand the people - parents, doctors, society, and certainly the patients - involved with AIDS.

$REVIEW.: The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is that the format is pan &amp; scan.  I realize this is/was a television production, so perhaps it was never filmed with a widescreen aspect ratio.  In any case, aside from that it is wonderful.  The picture looks good; I have seen none of the artifacts (pixelization) mentioned by another reviewer-the picture looks fine.  I might suggest getting a DVD lens cleaner-I had the same problem with all of my DVD's before I got one, and now I never have the problem.The sound is pretty good and the extras are nice.  The full-length commentary is a treat.  My wife and I sat down to watch a little bit and ended up watching over two hours.  The director and editor shed a lot of fun light on the production.  There is also about 15 minutes of Megan Follows auditioning which is fun.  There are a few missing scenes from the version that aired in Germany as well as production stills.Very nicely done.  Widescreen and perhaps more booklet notes would have been nice.  A treat.  (4 &amp; 1/2 stars)

The acting was first rate, the attention to detail in the sets and costumes enthralling, and the over-the-top characters, such as Atia of the Juliae and Cleopatra, were also absolutely enthralling.  A must-see, most definitely, and a cause for great regret that the project has finished and we won't have a third season devoted to the reign of Augustus (Octavian), which was full of incident.  Such a third season would provide a nice bridge to the old TV series, "I, Claudius," which would pick up with the next generation for those into dramatization of Roman history.

The instructor kept up a steady flow of instructions; some were pertinent, but others were simply extraneous information, and it made relaxing and fully engaging in the moves distracting.  Also, I was anticipating a yoga tape with moves that flowed from one into the other; this tape is a series of instructions in each segment that teaches one stretch at a time.  When instruction for that one is completed, the scene fades out and an entire new movement begins.  This would be a good tape for someone who wishes to just focus on individual movements or stretches.

So I knew going in that this was probably gonna fail, but it's one of those types that it's so bad it's funny. Now being an Insane Clown Posse fan (lette), I was instantly in love with Pervo the clown not only was his facepaint awesome, but he's obsessed with sex which is hilarious and he only wants to be known as Pervo the clown as he refuses to remove the facepaint remind you of someone? *cough* ICP. The comedy was great! The pooping midget with the stupid faces he makes and the grunting has to be priceless, a straight ten minutes of him swatting in zombie infested woods. Then you have naked or at least topless zombie chicks and again the sex obsessed clown is a win. Especially when he considers having sex with one of the zombies, but then realizes that she will eat him in a not so pleasant way and let's not forget TITTY HAMMERS! LOLIt's the type of movie that my friends and I would probably make just for laughs. I urge any horror/zombie fan to watch this movie knowing that it's low budget and mostly unknown actors going in, but you have to have an off the wall sense of humor in order to truly enjoy this movie. I've been raving about it since I saw it and movie night with friends will be epic thanks to this gem!

$REVIEW.: If there is one thing to say about this movie, it is fast paced, filled with many many different scenes, angles, flashbacks, settings, characters, and lord, never a dull moment.  The filming is quality, the concept with flashbacks is good, some settings are real and the views are generally beautiful.  But there is so much happening here, so much it is impossible to understand given that you are to, own your own, attempt to grasp the story as it unfolds.  I have not seen a film where so much has happened to a character that it becomes unbelievable.The lengthy Italian film is a dark psychological tormenting drama.  Ugly sex, nudity, brutality in flashbacks, abusive, graphic, violent and bloooody.  It unfolds with furthering complexities and played out too weird.  A child actor plays an important role and it is difficult to watch a child handled abusively while simultaneously, a graphic violent scene from Irena's past plays on.The focus is a young woman who has been in the sex slave, sadistic industry and gave birth to 9 kids and the kids would be sold on the black market.  She is in search of the latest child and becomes employed as a nanny/housekeeper and on the hunt with false information.  From there everything happens, including fast paced flashbacks, violent episodes.The DVD cover description is deceptive as it provides a mellow description that is clearly not what is described.  The film is lengthy.  I think I dozed off for 15 to 20 and she was still going through hell when I awoke.There is an excellent commentary by the director and a Behind the Scenes feature.  Again, if you haven't figured out the storyline, try the commentary, if not, you might need guts to view again or skip the entire movie, because there isn't enough time to try to figure it all out.....Rizzo

$review_text.: I teach a course at my University about films that either promote peace or have a peaceful subject, and this film is ideal. The "warrior" is a man who works for a local lord, raping, killing, and pillaging those who don't or can't pay the lord tribute. It's a little like a Mafia protection racket set in 18th century India. The film never directly shows the blood-spattering violence, but there's enough footage to fuel the imagination. Early on in a moment of extraordinary insight the hero vows never to lift another sword. However, the lord has other ideas and sends the same killers after him that he had previously led. One of the beauties of the film is the way the hero deals with these deadly assassins without resorting to violence. After the initial incidents, the movie turns into a road trip, with the hero encountering many fascinating characters and adventures along the way, but the action is never superficial or unnecessary. The characterization is wonderful, and the director uses a real blind woman to play a sort of blind sage whom the hero meets in his travels and wants to protect. The filmmakers have generously supplied one of the best Special Feature presentations of any DVD I've watched, which lays out in detail how it was made and is as enjoyable as the film itself. The stories about the blind woman and the street kid hired to act in the film are really touching. Highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: Starting last year, I began a new annual tradition of taking my daughter out on a date. Last year I took her out to a restaurant of her choice (McDonalds!), and then to a movie of her choice (Arthur Christmas). I figured this movie would be OK, but not great. I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy the movie from start to finish, and it was quite a bit better than expected. Though this is definitely a Christmas movie for kids, it's not the typical Christmas movie. This Santa is a high-tech, modern marvel guru who employs all sorts of gadgets and highly-trained squads of elves to deliver all of the Christmas goodies to the kids. The problem is, Santa is getting old, and it's time for him to choose his successor, and he can't decide which of his sons to pass the mantle to. Both sons have great character qualities that prove them to be deserving, but which one will he choose?A great movie for kids, and one that the adults will likely enjoy, as well.
$review_summary.: Much better than I expected it to be, and sure to be a kid-pleaser in most every home!

$review_text.: Sadly My First Mister basically went unnoticed in the theaters and quickly came to video where it sadly will sit on the shelves and gather dust like so many other smaller films but it is usally those smaller films that have the most heart and soul put into them but sadly some studios don't feel they will rake in the money and they don't release them to more theaters but with the word of mouth for this one I feel it would've been a hit! I saw Ebert and Roper review this film earlier this year on their show and both had so much great things to say about the film and eventually gave it two thumbs up, which is rightfully deserves. I rented the movie just the other night, not expecting that much from it but just a dark little comedy or something because that's how the reviews made it seem but by the end of the film I was totally blown away and in tears because it's such a great film. I think i'm even more saddend by the fact that not many people are going to pick up on this film and would rather rent one of Leelee Sobeski's other films like the Glass House and pass this one up because they never heard of it. Leelee has given us her greatest work in this film and truly shines in the role of J, the gothic loner who has nothing but eventually has more than she thought in her life. Of course the whole thing on the cover about the "new odd couple" really in my opinion makes this film seem more of a comedy than a drama but like the back of the box says...the movie is unpredictable, which it truly was to me because I didn't expect this film to blow me away like it did! Please to anyone that's reading this...go rent, buy, or steal (just don't tell them who told you to steal it you get caught!)this film because it truly is a wonderful piece of work that needs to be noticed and it's just far to good of a movie to collect dust on the video store shelves.

$REVIEW.: "The Glass House" (2001) is one of those films that you enjoy during the viewing thanks to good directing, good technical film-making (production design-nicely staged action sequences-odd camera angles), and convincing dialogue; but look back at feeling generally dissatisfied. In part this is due to the moronic final ten minutes but then you realize that the premise itself is the real problem. You don't mind suspending disbelief during the viewing but afterward you resent the fact that a less elaborate script would have made your efforts unnecessary.The film is yet another example of Hollywood's ability, given a relatively large budget $20-30 Million, to put together a good-looking and visually believable suspense movie. It brings skilled technique to a plot that's a foregone conclusion, so the viewer must wait patiently for the characters to catch up.For film buffs (those who like to read a film) there is a fairly ambitious subtext inside "The Glass House"; working on both conscious and sub-conscious levels. Warm (orange tones) lighting for the safe/secure scenes and cold (blue tones) lighting for the places where things are off-kilter. The Glasses (Diane Lane and Stellan Skarsgard) literally live in a "glass" house above the Malibu beach. The theme, that nothing is what it appears to be, is supported by a production design of reflective surfaces; mirrors, glass, and water (its always raining) that distort the images. Mrs. Glass is a physician in a pain center who is secretly addicted to her own medications. Mr. Glass runs a seemingly thriving limo service transporting famous clients behind smoked glass windows.There are several references to "Hamlet" with Ruby Baker (Leelee Sobieski) essentially in the role of the Melancholy Dane. The writer must have had this linked together much better in the screenplay but apparently several key elements of this dynamic never made it into production. This story is told entirely from Hamlet's point of view, a Hamlet who is frustratingly slow on the uptake and unable to make up her mind. And the viewer is supposed to be wondering what is real, what is wrongly perceived, and what is paranoid illusion. They even try to fool you with a dream sequence involving the return of Ruby's mother. Fortunately Sobieski (who looks like a young Helen Hunt) is an excellent actress and up to the challenge. Her performance (she is in every scene) keeps you focused on her story. The many scenes between her and Skarsgard are the film's real strength; they must carry the film since no one else in the cast is much of a factor.The film opens with a "film within a film" device, which turns out to be a horror film, late- night viewing for Ruby and her rave-loving high school friends. This is an early clue to the "nothing is what it seems to be" theme. It turns out that Ruby is quite a party animal and has been successfully deceiving her parents about her nocturnal activities. This night she returns home to find police cars parked outside her house. Believing herself finally busted she enters the house only to be told that her parent's were both killed in a car accident earlier that evening. This sets the stage for life with the Glass family, a childless couple who were friends with her parents. You instantly know that they are odd because the director works so hard to make them appear normal.Ruby and her little brother Rhett (Trevor Morgan) leave the San Fernando Valley to live with the Glass's in their expensive hilltop house. Can you say: "Hansel and Gretel in a Gingerbread cottage"? Things are weird from the start as the two children must share a room. Whatever the original rationale for this idea might have been got lost in the deleted scenes of the screenplay and it just seems silly and illogical (given the Glasses long-term plans). I assume that it was originally included to reinforce the idea that living in a glass house offers no privacy but who knows.From this point a lot of stuff happens which can be taken in several different ways with the director constantly laying misdirection. Wesley Strick's screenplay gets way too elaborate and cute with this stuff and the film must rely on many convenient coincidences to advance the storyline. But since this starts at about the midway point its too late to stop viewing now. Listening to the Strick's commentary track on the DVD it is clear that there was considerable meddling with the original story by producers, dumbing down the more intellectually compelling elements.Still little would have been lost and the overall credulity would have benefited by a less ambitious conspiracy, there was no reason for the parent's deaths to have been anything but an accident; it would have raised the film's IQ if the Glasses had been opportunists rather than conspirators. And the attempt at irony with the brake fluid would have worked better if Mr. Glass had been knocked out and put in his car; only to wake up as it is speeding down the road.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

$review_text.: Hey now, the way this starts out seems fairly innocent, including a young couple making love in a phone booth while on the phone to the young man's mother, but you sense that things are not what they seem when the young man takes a liking to a goat in the garden during an early morning stroll, WHOA.  And things build from there.  This squeaky clean young couple are not at all what they seem to be, and they proceed to off every pervert, sexual deviant, and drug addict that they can find while still managing to maintain that they're just there to have a nice time.  And I supposed they ARE having a nice time, but kee-ripes!  After having seen a few other films by Nico Mastorakis this has to be one of his most disturbing and thought-provoking pictures.  It's definitely a strange mix of things, Greek folk music, American folk music, hippies, and ex-patriate Americans & Brits who apparently came there to enjoy what they were not appreciated for elsewhere.  A nasty little film that will stay with you for a while, and I'd recommend it.

Very happy that Undertaker won and not Heidenreich, as the latter with a victory in this match would have been truly pathetic booking.

Nothing exceptional here and possibly one of the worst triple threat matches on PPV I have seen period.RATING: 67/100Orton vs. HHHI was expecting a lot more out of this match and a lot better counter wrestling with close kickouts and nearfalls. I was disappointed that this match failed to deliver on that. It was still a good match that was solid all the way through however.RATING: 78/100Royal RumbleGood Royal Rumble match that met the standards of the past but didn't really set new standards.

$REVIEW.: "The Talented Mr

Ripley" is a subtle and sometimes elegant thriller, of course, it helps that the movie has such a talented cast that includes Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law, Cate Blanchett and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, all of them carefully directed by Anthony Minghella.The strongest points in this movie are the cast of course, and the story

The plot of this film revolves around Tom Ripley, a very clever guy whose specialty is to assume other people's identities

Soon we learn that Ripley has a lot of hidden talents and secrets, most of the time Ripley is using his intelligence to get away with his tricks and scams, but even though he is an elegant criminal, he is also a very disturbed man that once in a while allows his inner demons to dominate him."The Talented Mr

Ripley" is a showcase to Matt Damon (by the way, he is a better actor and chooses better roles than his untalented fella, Ben Affleck), but the rest of the cast is equally impressive
When the movie came out, we all knew that Gwyneth Paltrow was more than just a pretty blonde girl, she is a fine actress and this movie is another example of her acting talent


"The Talented Mr
Ripley" also was the introduction of Jude Law to the big audiences, and the supporting cast includes talented people like Cate Blanchett and Phillip Seymour Hoffman.The locations in this movie are beautiful, and the director Anthony Minghella and the cinematographer John Seale used the beautiful backgrounds to create beautiful visuals


"The Talented Mr
Ripley" is a clever film and its very interesting to see the story of these characters.

It's entertaining watching the other girls show up and its also quite obvious that the main guy character isn't going to fall for any of them.The one gripe I do have is with the american girl who is constantly grabbing other girl's chest.  who is their right mind would do that?  No one!! This is obviously thrown in for the sake of fanboy eye candy but like I said, this does little to take away from the main storyline.The characters of this show are extremly compelling and I, someone who greatly dislikes romances, found myself moved to tears and some points of the show.

$review_text.: &#34;A Star Is Born&#34; (1954) is the artistic apex in the careers of both director George Cukor and star Judy Garland. 2014 is the 60th Anniversary of this masterpiece, providing a perfect reason to view it again on Blu-Ray. If you've been blown away by the intense emotions and talents on display here before; well, the Blu-Ray will blow you away again; this time almost to another dimension. The Cukor-Garland &#34;Star&#34; has never shined brighter than it does on Blu-Ray.The Blu-Ray Book Packaging is classy. The book, compiled by Judy Garland &#34;historian&#34; John Fricke, details the making of the classic 1954 version. After opening to rapturous critical reviews, the film was senselessly edited by 27 minutes (Fricke correctly calls this &#34;the preposterous purge&#34;). In 1983, late film historian Ronald Haver restored &#34;A Star Is Born&#34; to 2 hours and 56 minutes, almost Cukor's final cut). Haver used still photo frames to &#34;fill in&#34; for a little over 10 minutes where footage could not be found. In 1988, Haver wrote a book about the film and &#34;restoration experience.&#34; The restored version was released on VHS tape and DVD. And now, here it is, better than ever on Blu-Ray. Fans are still hoping that a complete version will be discovered and released some day.The 1954 &#34;A Star Is Born&#34; completely eclipses the other versions (a glossy 1937 melodrama starring a sweet and undisturbed Janet Gaynor, and a nonsensical 1976 ego trip for Barbra Streisand) for excellent reasons. Both George Cukor and Judy Garland were battle-scarred Hollywood veterans. Both knew all too well how Hollywood can use, abuse, and throw away talent. The tone of Moss Hart's screenplay is more dark, cynical and acid than the 1937 version. The 1954 version is intensely, painfully personal. And that is why this version is the masterpiece that leaves the other &#34;also ran&#34; versions in the dust.George Cukor, a highly successful and respected (but not very &#34;in the closet&#34; gay) director knew exactly what you had to conceal about yourself-- and the games you have to play-- in order to survive in Hollywood. But Cukor's &#34;A Star Is Born&#34; is all about revealing, rather than concealing,  everything. Cukor deftly explores, and in several scenes exploits, the darker, edgier aspects of Judy Garland's complex personality. Judy's potent performance power was often held back in her more lightweight MGM musicals. Here, in Cukor's full-force drama, Judy's talents and emotions explode. The musical numbers, mostly by Harold Arlen and Ira Gershwin, are brilliant.  Judy is nuanced, intense, and mesmerizing singing &#34;The Man That Got Away.&#34; Her 15 minutes &#34;Born In A Trunk&#34; medley ends the film's first half on a thrilling high note. Later, Judy enchants us again with a seemingly &#34;impromptu&#34; performance of &#34;Someone At Last.&#34; And when Judy breaks down, she breaks our hearts. After a near nervous breakdown in her dressing room, Judy as Esther Blodgett/Vicki Lester returns to complete a take of the now restored number &#34;Lose That Long Face.&#34; The instant switch she makes, from tearful despair to cheerful smiles, is dramatically arresting. Judy had to make that same switch countless times at MGM. By now, she was frighteningly convincing at it.James Mason, as the falling alcoholic &#34;star&#34; husband Norman Maine, is Judy's equal in heartbreak. The Academy Awards scene, where a wobbly and drunk Norman begs for a job and slaps Esther across the face in the process, is haunting and unforgettable. Norman Maine is the star who falls and fades out, but James Mason plays him with a respectful and even remarkable dignity. Charles Bickford as Studio Boss Oliver Niles, Jack Carson as devilish and devious press agent Matt Libby, and Tom Noonan as Esther's stalwart (and possibly gay??) best friend Danny McGuire are all equally excellent.Cukor biographer Patrick McGilligan describes &#34;A Star Is Born&#34; as Cukor's most passionate and accomplished film; a &#34;gut chuck  of nerves and misery-- a musical noir. Was there any  musical in Hollywood history, before the deviations of the 1960's, with quite the shock value?&#34; The film effectively captures the &#34;all-time thrill&#34; of Judy Garland and George Cukor at their artistic apex. But we never forget the pain. As McGillian  notes, this &#34;A Star Is Born&#34;, one of the most essential and seminal films of the 1950's, also captures a brutal Hollywood where happiness is &#34;trampled by the blood, sweat and tears of personal ambition.&#34;

$REVIEW.: About a year ago when suddenly there were no copies of this available through the retail market, I took notice of the incredibly high asking prices that some individual online sellers wanted. I knew there was no way I would spend big bucks for something that was originally worth a lot less. Then I happened to find a brand new copy of the DVD in a local record store. I bought it cheap, never opened it and sold it on the Internet for a huge profit. I believed a lot of the reviewers on Amazon that the DVD transfer of"This Island Earth" was nothing to write home about so had no problem with making a little money on it. The problem is, where is a re-release of this film from Universal? What's taking them so long? Are they planning to wait until the film is destroyed? This is an important science fiction classic that needs and deserves to be preserved and presented on DVD. "This Island Earth" is arguably the most imaginative science fiction film of the 1950s and it seems Universal is brushing it aside. C'mon, get with the program, Universal. You got this film and a whole bunch more from the fifties like "Tarantula," "Monster on the Campus," and "The Mole People" that a lot of fans would like to see offered on DVD. Let's get rolling on this stuff.AddendumWhat is up with the good folks at Universal? This little gem has been making sellers of "Rare DVDs" rich over the past three years, yet the clowns in charge of Universal sit back and don't try to cash in on their own product. There's obvious bootlegs floating around, and the Image Entertainment release is selling for big-time bucks.And it's not just "This Island Earth" where Universal, and unfortunately, collectors and fans, are losing out. The studio has an entire plethora of classics sitting in their vaults rotting away. What about "Tarantula," "Monster on the Campus," "The Deadly Mantis," and "The Monolith Monsters?" Those titles along with a bunch of others haven't appeared on DVD at all yet. Now, rare video salespeople are peddling VHS copies of "Tarantula" for the low, low price of only $30 or more. Soon, they'll be asking for $300 for a VHS copy of "Tarantula." Maybe some of these rare video sellers will start offering a package deal that includes a DVD copy of "This Island Earth," boxed together with vhs copies of "The Mole People," "The Incredible Shrinking Man," and "Monster on the Campus" for the bargain-basement rate of $7,999. What a steal!!Addendum #2The party is finally over for sellers of "rare" Image Entertainment copies of the "This Island Earth" DVD. I can't wait to see the new bargain basement rates. They won't be able to give those older versions away now. I'm glad I cashed in on mine a long time ago on Ebay.

$REVIEW.: This is clearyly Clint Eastwood's greatest work.We all get to see Iwo Jima. We all  know the image of the guys hoistng old Glory atop the Japanese Hill. We Americans have seen it in many films like the one with John Wayne but this time we get to see it through eyes of the other side that of the Japanese. From the ordinary grunt to the Japanese Navy officer who goes so gung ho that he tries to find himself an american tank to throw himself under but ultimately gets captured (This is based on a real person who was there in the battle and captured, read about him once in The Rising Sun by John Toland, wish they had shown more with him). To the General in charge. From the first arrival to the final charge, it shows the Japanese soldiers well. And Clint Eastwood serves us well telling us about them through their eyes with this film of his. Just as I respect him for showing what American soldiers were like as well. Since Japanese troops did not take prisoners and mistreatedt hose they took many American units did not take prisoners either.Admittedly, the battle was well fought and due to lack of opprtunity, no major crimes typical of Japanese soldiers such as the rape of Nanking or the butchery of Manilla or the Bataan Death March or the murder and eating of captured American Airmen at near by Chichi Jima, so it is very easy to admire the Japenese here. Certainly I would have liked to know more and see more of Korean Labour units but apparently none were employed on the island.Great film.

$review_text.: Joss Whedon's "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" is one of the best shows ever written for television, but this spin off featuring Buffy's first love, Angel, is even more consistantly entertaining than its parent show

Co-created by Whedon and David Greenwalt, "Angel" features the adventures of Angel (David Boreanaz), the vampire cursed with a soul as he roams Los Angeles, battling demons and helping the helpless in hopes of finding redemption for his past crimes


Joining him is Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter), one of Buffy's classmates who has moved to L.A, along with half-demon Doyle (Glenn Quinn)


Over the course of the series, Angel and Cordelia are joined by a cast of great characters, including Buffy and Faith's ex-watcher Wesley (Alexis Denisof), vampire hunter Gunn (J

August Richards), the cute and brainy Fred Burkle (Amy Acker), and kareoke singing demon Lorne (Andy Hallet)
The show gets better and better with each passing season (whereas Buffy sore of jumped around in quality after season 3), with the final season being by far my favorite season of any show ever

If you enjoy dark, sprawling epics, interesting characters and writing that will actually make you think, I cannot reccomend Angel (as well as "Buffy") enough
I also reccomend picking up the "Angel: After the Fall" comics, which is the official continuation of Angel's story written by Whedon and author Brian Lynch.


$SUMMARY.: My favorite show

$REVIEW.: When friends come over for movie night, the first thing I always ask them is; have you ever seen 'True Romance'? It is always my first pick out of the 1100 movies I own, when company comes. It is Tony Scott's masterpiece, and the best thing Quentin ever wrote. Over the top, way way violent, and unforgettable performances by a star-studded cast. So many memorable lines to add to the pop culture. And am still amazed at how unknown this film is to movie fans! Tony Scott will always be remembered as a high octane film maker. One who could make sense out of the kinetic editing process, to give us many thrills. Thanks for the wild ride Tony, may you rest in peace.

$REVIEW.: It should be said that I'm only giving this movie 4 stars because it's strictly a guilty pleasure.  It's a guilty pleasure because I enjoyed the action sequences, but overall the movie is poor and good to watch MST3K style (hopefully rifftrax.com will get busy on that).Anyway, no this isn't a movie where everyone dies at the end, though when you witness the acting, you will wish it did.  Yes the lighting is bad at parts, but some people blow it out of proportion.  It's watchable enough to keep up with what's going on, though it's at its worst in 1 part in the hospital scene, a couple other times in the sewers.  The Predalien was interesting, but I didn't care for the concept of it impregnating other women to make more aliens.Eh, let me put the positives in a nutshell:*Good action sequences.That's it.  Now the negatives:*Subpar lighting*Laughable acting (not quite sci-fi channel bad)*Lack of a storyline (or at least one that anyone cares about)*Overall quality of the movie seemed lesser than the first AVP, except for some of the action sequencesThe audio commentary is worth a listen though.  The directors discuss some things they wanted in the movie that they couldn't afford (impressive what they could do with what they had on a low budget, whatever your opinion may be on the movie), such as making the final fight between the Predator and Predalien 3 times longer than it was, or even character development (though no matter what they say, the human characters were a lost cause, no one cares, they weren't capable of making them carable).So if you don't mind subpar acting, no story, but enjoy good old sci-fi action, this is at least worth a rent.  Afterwards, decide if it's a guily pleasure for you too.  Some say this is better than the first AVP movie, but I say it's equally as enjoyable, and that the first AVP is unjustly bashed upon.

$REVIEW.: "Parasite" is a movie that proves the British can make a movie every bit as bad as any other country. This film is a veritable grab bag of terrible acting, ridiculous plotpoints, horrid CGI, the evils of capitalism, and mind-boggling continuity errors. It starts out with a self-important group of environmentalist eco-warriors breaking and entering (for justice against the evil big oil companies, of course) with a sequence that oozes pretentiousness (much of the film aspires to this, but of course being so bad, really doesn't bolster the environmental lobby.) The "Alliance for Green Protection" headed by outlaw Mickey (unappealingly scruffy Conrad Whitaker) is about to expose an oil company for an amorphously evil project, forcing evil oil company tycoon Richard Reiser (Nick Rawlinson) to accelerate the testing of a revolutionary cleaning solution by several months. (Ponder.) Unsurprisingly Reiser names chief scientist and token oil company hottie Dr. Christine Hansen (Saskia Gould) to test the enzymatic cleaner on an abandoned North Sea oil rig the next day. She protests that it isn't ready for testing, etc., but Reiser insists.Since Hansen is in charge you would think she would lead the project, but Reiser sends a squad of the most utterly dysfunctional roughnecks out to the platform under the leadership of Officer in Charge Jacob (G.W. Stevens) a cowardly idiot with no sense of humor and a scarring past involving a plane crash that killed his wife (although that plot diversion wasted lots of screen time, it was never revealed how it was in any way relevant to the story.) These buffoons spend most of their time on the rig playing with kid's toys (you just know that this will be a moronic plot device later in the film, and I'm afraid to reveal that you are correct,) messing about on the computer, and showering, but also have plenty of time to work on a wonky generator, inspiring great dialogue like "I need to reach the inlet valve." They also have time to get the top-secret stuff that has very specific instructions for its use, and numerous biohazard warnings and disclaimers about how it poses a genetic risk, and spray it with hoses all over the inside of the rig. The directions? They went unread. Of course.When Dr. Hansen shows up she is mortified at the misuse of her chemicals, but now they are all stuck on the rig because the weather is so bad that helicopters can't land. (This is all shown with bad CGI of an oil rig with waves around it.) As violent as the weather is, and as far from land as the rig is, the eco-terrorists manage to take a rubber raft to it and capture the oil company workers without difficulty. (Surely this will lead to justice!) Mickey has a lot of ponderous dialogue, and it's quickly revealed that his ex-girlfriend is...no points for guessing this one...Hansen. Oh, please. She explains lamely that she is now battling the system from within, but Mickey will have none of it. Very soon ludicrous CGI caterpillars start eating the crew (no points for guessing who will be left at the end) and after a bit of Stockholm Syndrome, everyone bands together except for the ostensible OIC Jacob, the only one with keys to the rig, who hides. (Ponder.) There's a lot of footage reminiscent of "The Blair Witch Project" from the vantage point of the eco-warriors, and some reflux-inducing dialogue like "welcome to the food chain" delivered ominously. The worst dialogue in the film is this exchange between Hansen and Mickey: "Last minute words of advice?"..."Yeah. Don't die." I couldn't make that up.The group collectively decides to abandon the rig, but, oh yeah, they need to get to the escape pods on the other side of it. (What happened to their raft?)  Since they don't have the keys and Jacob is pointlessly antisocial, there is much ado about starting a second generator, and getting electrical power to the escape pods, which require enormous amounts of electricity to run (what the cast actually needed was an electrician, obviously.) The power goes out every couple of minutes inspiring flicker vertigo more than anything, although it was presumably meant to instill fear and apprehension. There's heroism and self sacrifice (especially in the unique electrical worm ignition escape sequence) and a predictable and hilarious moment when Hansen rips her t-shirt into a scanty halter top to use the cloth for a Molotov cocktail to immolate the CGI menace, which she has revealed to be giant bacteriophages thus providing minor titillation to the teenage boys and the biochemists in the audience in equal measure.I was amused by the premise that vast electrical distribution grids were necessary to power "escape pods" from a central control room far from the pods themselves on an oil rig. (As if it needs to be said, this is completely unlike reality.) I was equally amused by how much light there was and how many computer things worked inside the rig with allegedly no power available. I was less amused by the romantic rendezvous the escape pod ride enabled for Mickey and Christine, though you can't say you didn't see it coming. As a grand finale you know Reiser will get his comeuppance, and he does so at the hands of The Alliance for Green Protection, courtesy of the new dynamic duo of eco-terrorists, Mickey and Christine. I'm sure you are as surprised as I was.This unmitigated mess of a disaster film was filmed in England in 2003 mostly in Oxford, with a lot of location work done at "G" Site Boiler House, MOD UK, Bicester (how's that for a grand location?) and oddly at the Army Air Corps Museum, Middlewallop. The locations actually provide a reasonably suitable background for the action; unfortunately none of the action is worth seeing. "Parasite" is an utterly boring and relentlessly bad motion picture that is nigh-impossible to enjoy even if you have a more powerful knack than most people do for suspension of disbelief. Diehard fans of Z-grade horror films might find a few inappropriate laughs here or there, but the film takes itself way too seriously for any kind of widespread adulation by B-movie fans.With material like this to work with nobody from Director Andrew Prendergast to Clapper/Loader Ossian Bacon could save this tawdry nonsense from the rubbish bin of terrible movies. My advice? Let it rest in peace. Or better yet, in pieces.

Moore may not be as good as Connery, but he comes pretty damn close

He's much better than the non-  personality Brosnan
This film has one of the more intelligent plots

Bond  sets out to find who is forging international jewelry


Along the way he  uncovers a plot to detonate a bomb in West Germany, and give Russia a  chokehold on the world


Louis Jordan has never been better and is as good  as Christopher Lee during the Moore years


The train sequence, and the  opening jet plane are highlights
&quot; All Time High &quot; is one of my  least favorite theme songs, but it is romantic

$REVIEW.: I went with my dad to see this in theaters and it was truly pathetic. It wasn't very scary at all. It only had a couple of jump scenes at the beginning and that's it. The "eight legged freaks" look fake. They're so darn computerized and cartoonish that you'll wish to return this to your local rental store. Don't buy this movie. It's not worth your hard earned money. Now if you want to see a REALLY good thriller with spiders, then buy Arachnaphobia (starring Jeff Bridges and John Goodman. Trust me, you'll get your money's worth. But if you still want to see Eight Legged Freaks, then rent it first before deciding to buy it. If you rent it, watch it, and really enjoy it, then go ahead and buy the darn thing. But keep in mind this is my opinion. Watch it for yourself & make up your own mind about this 'freakin' movie.  It had some O.K. action scenes in it but nothing to blow me away though. I've seen better than this. And that's all I've got to say.

I could not believe it! And the average age of the actors increased by 20 years? Also in Part I, I thought the set was like cheaply rented and badly thought, here in part II, it is again, far worse...I don't know... if part III comes out, it may be like, it's so bad, it could be really good!Well, maybe I am quite unique here, because I am more or less forced to get into this Atlas Shrugged thing.... If it wasn't for my coworker friend, I would have watched this thing for 5 minutes and moved on to something else and forgot about it completely.In a word, I am the wrong audience here!

$review_text.: Not what I had hoped for, this film barely classifies as a slasher film; you can count the number of victims on one hand, with a digit leftover!  The plot plods along in no hurry to get anywhere.  There's little in the way of suspense, no fright.  The pacing is way off; most scenes feel as if they're skipping a beat, trying to be something they're not.  There's no great secret who is doing what and why.  The villain is standard fare, employing the usual affectations: wild eyes and a crazy grin.  Even the ending is lazy.  For me, this was a huge disappointment.

$review_text.: I understand the message that the director and writers were trying to convey
They wanted to show a creative and artistic montage of race relations in the United States


But instead I feel that the film was a huge exaggeration of the situation and therefore losing the effectiveness of the message that they were trying to convey


There were times in the movie that I just wanted to slap my forehead
The "comedic relief" in the film was Ludacris and his friend with their hypocritical ramblings

Those scenes just made me mad because they were on serious issues that shouldn't be taken lightly.Some people may disagree with me, but this is just my honest opinion


This film won Best Picture only because the old, conservative Oscar selection committee didn't want a "gay" movie to win


Brokeback Mountain was an obvious winner over this one.I am not saying that the movie is trash, it certainly isn't but it shouldn't be watched lightly


It's a serious film that should be watched WITH AN OPEN MIND and preferably in an academic setting so that critical analysis can take place


And this is certainly NOT a film that would be used to introduce an outsider to race relations and racism in America simply because it is so exaggerated.

$REVIEW.: Piranha is a well directed, fast paced, tongue in cheek, homage to Jaws. A young Joe Dante shows his directing talents, and Rob Bottin, (fx-effects-then only 17), shows his early talents too. Rob later went on to The Howling, The Thing, etc. a genius. Dante, directed The Howling, and Gremlins, both films have so many hidden tributes to other films I can't count them all. Now back to this film, based on the unprecedented success of Jaws, sooner or later ripoffs come. But this isn't a ripoff, characters differ hugely, unlike Grizzly(read my review), and humor is splattered throughout, where Jaws was in the whole, intensely serious. The effects are pretty darn convincing, you learn to actually relate with the characters, and hey, it's a Corman film, king of the B movies, and his best, hands down. This is a cult classic, remade identical for T.V. with William Katt, which sucked. Not a heck of a-lot of scares, but very fast paced and keeps ya glued to the screen. Looks great on DvD, the visuals are very bright and clear.....and that piranha sound is enough to leave you a little on edge. Enjoy the film, don't expect Pacino performances or awards, but instead, what a group of young, talented, dedicated, people set out to do, a fun film.

$REVIEW.: There was little doubt that there would be a sequel to the hit 2009 comedy about a group of friends trying to put together the pieces of an alcohol soaked night in Las Vegas. Hollywood is first and foremost a business and no one is going to pass up the opportunity to squeeze more money out of a popular commodity. What's so frustrating about The Hangover Part II is the complete lack of anything resembling creativity or originality on the part of everyone involved. This movie is one of the most blatant examples of "phoning it in" that I have ever seen.The plot is an exact replica of the first film. Once again the wolf pack (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galafranakas) find themselves hung-over after a wild night of partying (this time in Thailand) and working to figure out what happened. I could spend more time discussing the plot, but if you've seen the first film, then you've seen this one. The jokes are essentially the same, but the laughs are few and far between. The movie does seem to be striving to be cruder than the first, but it falls flat in that respect as well. Even the cast doesn't seem to be having as much fun this time around.If you saw the first movie, skip this one since it is merely a faded copy of the much funnier original. If you haven't seen it then watch it and forget about this lame excuse to cash in at the box office. The Hangover was fun but the party is over and it's time to move on.

$REVIEW.: This show is one of the best to come out of the last few years.  If you like Wes Anderson, Kevin Smith, or any other weird, quirky humor than you will enjoy this show.  Jason Schwartzman and Zach Galifiankis have really good chemistry, and the dialogue between them is really great.The show is about a down-on-his-luck author, Jonathon Ames (Schwartzman) who gets dumped by his girlfriend, which inspires him to begin moonlighting as an unlicensed private detective.  The stories are funny, but not completely outrageous, and the acting is really fun as well.The best part of the show is Jason's boss, played by Ted Danson.  His acting is incredible, and his jokes are VERY funny. His dialogue makes the show.  Again, if you like quirky humor this show is really for you, and please give it a chance so it stays on TV.  It's great!

$review_text.: First off, this is the Star Wars Trilogy DVD set, so it's still worth the price just to have a clean set of these movies.  And I'm not going to harp on the scene changes because I liked them and thought they added nicely to the movie.  What kept this from becoming an "Epic" release for me was the music audio problems on "A New Hope" for the final scene.  The John Williams theme that so clearly defined this final battle originally is barely present and detracts from the dramatic effect of the ending.  Before now, the music heightened the tone and helped put us on the edge of the seat....but not now.  It's dull and inaudible.One other note.  I also read the channels of music audio came out wrong/reversed.Just for those glitches, I dropped a star.This will work until he releases another updated set in a few years....but that's all.  Consider waiting for a sale unless you can't wait.

$review_text.: As with several other ABT rep. programs and galas captured for television, this DVD contains several pas de deux, an ensemble piece, and in this case, the pas de trois "Remanso".  And as with galas and rep. programs, it is a mix of classical and neo-classical choreography.  The interspersed interviews with the Artistic Director Kevin McKenzie and the dancers provide context: roles, preparation, importance to ABT's repertoire, and biographical info re both dancers and choreographer's intent.  As an overview of ABT's vast eclectic repertoire and intro to ballet in general, it is an excellent dvd to own--and the strength and technique of the dancers is also well worth viewing.  But the MOST important use of this dvd is when it is viewed in comparison to other ABT performances (available on similar dvd's) of the same pieces...BLACK SWAN: It is wonderful that Susan Jaffe (sadly now retired) was captured on this dvd with the always impeccable partnering and technique of Jose Manuel Carreno.  Her beautiful extensions, relish in the role, and slinky grace are very much evident.  Is it the ultimate fluid grace of Cynthia Gregory and bravura of Fernando Bujones (What a shock his passing was! How sad.)on the video/dvd "ABT in San Francisco"?  Or Makarova? Or the technical mastery of Gillian Murphy in the recent HD performance for PBS? No, but that's why balletomanes view different casts, to compare.  Personally, Carreno still does the most complex controlled (dare I say difficult?) improvs to the standard male variation of most present/previous ABT casts.ROMEO & JULIET Balcony Sc.: Of course the Ferri-Bocca partnership is legend at ABT and around the world. But I am sorry, this performance looked majorly under-rehearsed. Even Ms. Ferri herself, says they don't need to rehearse or speak often.  Ok, they have done it countless times in the last twenty years; but if not together in a while, timing/placement issues will arise.  And that's what's visible here.  The placement on many of the lifts looks rushed, glossed over, and a bit uncomfortable.  The follow thru and epaulement is missing. All in all, the fluidity and flow through each move and phrase to the end of this beautiful pas de deux is sometimes rather choppy.  How can I say this?  Because I have seen them dance much better elsewhere.  And when this performance is viewed in comparison to the Ferri/Corella pairing at La Scala, those slips are more evident. Though taken at a faster clip, (with a better orchestra), the Ferri/Corella Balcony pas de deux is probably the more perfect technically and dramatically.  Of course, both Ferri and Bocca are accomplished actors and this performance is fine in that department, if a little overdone. (That's to be expected from dancers so comfortable in the roles and with each other.) Comparisons can also be made with Ferri/Eagling 15 years earlier,and even an excerpt of Kent/Stiefel on the "CenterStage" dvd. (I except Fonteyn/Nureyev which stands alone.)LEAVES ARE FADING: A lovely performance by a lovely dancer, Amanda McKerrow, who embodies Tudor's eloquent choreography as naturally as breathing.  That she is partnered by her husband, John Gardner, only makes it more special for the delicacy and trust evident in their partnering.  An excerpt that makes one yearn for the entire piece. It brought back memories of Gelsey: different, bolder, but still amazing.  Other Tudor pieces by ABT are available on dvd for comparison, it not "Leaves..." entirely.DON QUIXOTE Grand Pas: In the interviews prefacing this performance, both Herrera and Corella admit to being young--21 (and 23?)at the time--but are they really the "unseasoned prodigies" a NY critic called them?  Not in this performance! View this in comparison to the Baryshnikov/Harvey performance, and both the technique, partnering, and interplay are very much superior.  Again, Corella takes things at a faster clip than Baryshnikov. Corella's speed allows more rotations in the pirouettes, and that, and his astonishing ballon make that jete entrelace/entournant amazing both for speed and precision. But watch the details in the partnering: The mirrored line in both partners' sautes, epaulement, and turn of hand & foot; the precise musical phrasing; and the joyous insouciance in the interactions between them. (Even Baryshnikov & Gelsey in '74 missed that, though technically equal.) Paloma Herrera, too, has formidible technique and she takes full advantage of the chances this pas offers, and her partner displays, with aplomb. Bravura dancing is always going to elicit loud claps and cheers, but as McKenzie notes earlier, technique is not all, and here it's the glow that emanates from both dancers, coupled with that technique that really makes this work.REMANSO provides a different opportunity to view Malakov and Parrish in a nonclassical performance.  And a chance to see Duato's choreography beyond the limited dvd's released here. Others have reviewed this, and I have no disagreements with their superlative assessments.  It is a small jewel of a ballet that slyly comments on human interactions, through the comparison, contrast, and collaboration of three very talented dancers.CRUEL WORLD and the concluding BRUCH VIOLIN CONCERTO lets one see the Kent/Hill partnership in action and like the other partnerships on display in this dvd, it is a joy to watch.Finally, Ethan Stiefel's comments are always pertinenet and that very precise, powerful technique is always worthwhile viewing.  It's a quick view, but it's there.  Ditto, Ashley Tuttle. And yes,unfortunately, the camera gets a little sloppy in this final piece--too many bodies to watch?--though the TD seems able to punch on the beat.So, this dvd is definately worth purchasing for a chance to view most of the current stars of ABT in performance, and to sample various classic (and soon-to-be-classic?) choreography.Enjoy.

$review_text.: I'm sure you've heard this is a great movie - it's true! The storyline is great, characters are wonderful, comedic timing is perfect - and there's no cheezy musical interludes you'll find in every other Disney movie.In fact, this hardly seems like a children's movie at all. It has a PG-rating, which means the action and storyline is more exciting than something you'd find in a G-rated movie.This is a double-disc DVD set and they've really tried to include as many extras as possible. The Behind-the-Scenes footage was a little disappointing (mostly Brad Bird cracking his crew up or arguing with other producers) - I had hoped for some more in-depth footage of actually animating the film, whereas this is more of how the film was "produced" and "managed".This is something worth owning.
$SUMMARY.: Fun Movie!

$REVIEW.: In more than twenty-five years of watching Trek, from childhood on, I have never been so disillusioned with the series. Never before have I been so ... frankly, bored. The Romulans are my favorite villains and were completely wasted here. I expect some Star Trek fans (the minority who feel it is wrong to criticize any Star Trek story, any time) to therefore find this review "unhelpful," which is too bad - I cared very deeply for this series, and for many of the characters, but the actors seem tired.Given time - and by that, I mean time away, with the franchise hibernating for a while, kind of like Disney and their "vault" for animation releases - Star Trek will probably come back and regain the love and loyalty of both diehard fans and the average person who enjoys these adventures. Star Trek can get away with being goofy or politically incorrect, then too politically *correct* - and still tell a classic tale. Having rewatched "First Contact," it still holds up years later, marvelously, and the Borg are if anything more menacing than they were on the TV show. But now the series needs time off.While this will probably antagonize Battlestar Galactica purists, I recommend tracking down some web-based interviews with Ronald D. Moore, who left Star Trek: Deep Space 9 and discussed very candidly the problems accumulating with Voyager, Enterprise and this movie, and how televised science fiction could grow. Even if you hate Moore's version of Galactica, that interview will help you appreciate the tensions that went into the most recent incarnations of Star Trek, and why so many ardent fans have stopped watching. For real entertainment, of course, you could just get "First Contact" or "Wrath of Khan"....

To keep this short and simple if you liked the first film you'll love the 2nd. Robert Downey Jr. plays Holmes even better the second time around and Jude Law's Watson is unforgettable. However the most amazing performance is that of Jared Harris as Professor James Moriarty who is SuperB. Noomi Rapace (The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo) also co-stars and does an admirable job. Overall its a slick, stylish, fun adventure. A Game Of Shadows is one of the best Holiday films we've seen in a long time. I highly recommend this film to anyone as well as the first. 5/5.

 In the investigation of their crimes Murdoch's scientific dabblings lead him to develop tools and methods to aid the investigations which include everything from using coal dust to recover &#34;finger marks&#34; to devising a machine to monitor sound waves underwater (sonar)
Allow his inability to express his love to his colleague, pathologist Dr

Julia Ogden (also very cutting edge for her time) is the frustrating undertone of the series
 The characters of the Toronto Constabulary are lovable and quirky
And although the topic of murder is not funny and the series is not a comedy, it does take a lighter aire and does not have the blood, guts and violence of most crime dramas
 Sadly this is the last season I've watched because despite enjoying the series, I refuse to pay $2.99 per episode for subsequent seasons.

$REVIEW.: SPOILERS FOLLOWUpfront, "Savannah Smiles" is a classic.  It relies on a simple, humane story and gives a profound message emphasizing the need for compassion and love in life.Starring Bridgette Andersen, Mark Miller and Donovan Scott, it tells the story of a young runaway girl named Savannah Driscoll who unknowingly hides in the backseat of the stolen car of two escaped convicts.  Alvie and Boots are very solidly played by Mark Miller and Donovan Scott as opposite sides of the same coin, with Miller's Alvie being the more hardened of the two.  There is an entire family backstory for Alvie that heightens the realistic tone of the storytelling.Also starring Barbara Stanger and Chris Robinson as Savannah's politically connected parents, and featuring Pat Morita and Peter Graves, "Savannah Smiles" is excellent.

$REVIEW.: I'm a huge fan of old movies, and especially of Audrey Hepburn.She's proved how lovely and talented she is time and time again through such films as Breakfast at Tiffany's, Sabrina, My Fair Lady, Roman Holiday, Two for the Road, How To Steal a Million, etc.However, "Love in the Afternoon," really fails to capture the essence of her other films. There is very little charisma and attraction between Cooper and Hepburn. Cooper looks like he's trying way to hard, and seriously the man looks almost in his 60's, and Miss Hepburn was in her 20's. Maurice Chevalier performed an excellent role, but it made me grimace because Cooper is only a few years younger than Chevalier. If they wanted to do the whole "playboy" thing, they didn't need to go for Hugh Hefner age. There is a lack of chemistry in this film, and although parts of it are charming, overrall, I felt let down.

Chucky lives in his basement and has never seen his parents, the only time they come into contact with him is when they throw food down to him.  His buddy Allen crawls through the basement window to visit him.  And that's where we always visit with Chucky, through the basement window.  He and Allen talk about their adventures and crazy stuff they do.  There is one Chucky Margolis skit over on Youtube, I think it's the very first one.  Chucky and Allen talk about how they snuck upstairs when the parents were away, Chucky drank some green water from a long tube, then threw up in the aquarium.  Hi-larious.

$review_text.: This dvd I was a little excited about so I read some reviews on here to see what people had to say about it.  I would have to agree on the negative reviews with this dvd.  The quality isn't very good.  Too many cheesy effects over the video which to me is very distracting.  This dvd was taken from 9 different concerts on their Festival tour in various countries to very huge audiences.  This is also the first tour with Porl Thompson since Wish.  The song list is pretty good.  They actualy play some rare songs in here that I haven't seen them play live in a while but some of the playing is a little sloppy and Robert's singing sounds lazy at times.  Probably the worst part about this dvd is that there are no keyboards at all.  This was a very big mistake from Robert as I always thought keyboards were an essential part for The Cure.  Oh sure Three Imaginary Boys was without keyboards.  But that was 1979 and the band was just getting started.  After many albums later all with keyboard we all expect to hear keyboards.  I am a huge cure fan and have collected a lot of their work including bootlegs.  This is worth having for the collection but don't expect an amazing concert film like In Orange.  When they will ever put In Orange or Show on DVD I have no idea but we really need those.  In fact I also agree with other reviews that Trilogy is a better live dvd then this.  If you don't have Trilogy get that one first then get this.  This is an ok dvd but The cCure can do better.  I know this was edited by Robert Smith and I think he's gone off his rocker ever since he let the horrible Ross Robinson produce The Cure album for them.

$review_text.: Wheewww! have to get some fresh air? After watching this british exploitation film, i must say that it is a totally off the wall, freaky, gore filled, totally insane film. every minute it gets even more weird, and you are bombarded with total insanity. It has a really bizarre storyline and is a cross between FILMS such as Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Two Thousand Maniacs, Friday the 13TH, and other horror classics. I even noticed a little Monty Python thrown in with the naked piano player. alot of gore and blood was in this movie, and it even made me a little squeamish. Found this little film really warped and surreal and think that this may become a cult classic. The 5 teens did a fantastic job with their acting, just wish the main guy and cute girlfriend could have made it out alive. I'm sure that this film could be watched... dont know if it would be approved by all... but it is a full fledged assault on your senses. Wonder if this film company will be making more likewise films, would be anxiously awaiting to see more of their future works.

$review_text.: "Atonement" turns out to be a much better movie than it is a book.  But before I explain what I mean by that, a little background on the story may be in order.Ian McEwan's novel - which spans eight decades, from the 1930's to the present day - centers around Briony Tallis, a precocious 13-year-old who lives with her family on a country estate in England.  Briony is an imaginative child who revels in a world of fantasy and make-believe, a writer of stories and plays who is actually less equipped to interpret the realities of the adult world than she gives herself credit for.  One unusually hot summer day in 1935, Briony witnesses a series of events involving her older sister, Cecilia, and the caretaker's son, Robbie, that her child's mind misinterprets in a way that leads to tragic consequences for all involved.  Her choosing to act on what she believes to be true winds up echoing down the corridors of time, through World War II and beyond.  As time passes and Briony grows to adulthood, she comes to see the error of her ways and spends the rest of her life trying to find a way to atone for what she has done.  The coup de grace is that, due to circumstances beyond her control, Briony is forced to achieve her redemption in the only way she knows how - as a writer.At the risk of offending devotees of the novel, I must confess to being somewhat less than enamored with a book that many seem to rank among their all-time favorites.  For despite its sometimes impressive dreamlike quality, the novel is too contrived and self-conscious to make the reader anything more than a mere dispassionate observer of the events it is portraying.  As a writer, McEwan has an undeniable flair for narrative voice and description, but it frequently comes at the expense of characterization and story.  His plotting is often arbitrary and clumsy, and his dialogue, when indeed he deigns to use any, is almost always stilted and unconvincing (I have to admit to laughing and rolling my eyes when I was reading the crucial letter-swapping scene).Yet, something has gone terribly right with the material in its journey from the printed page to the silver screen (suffice it to say, I didn't roll my eyes this time around).  Since film is a largely visual medium, screenwriter Christopher Hampton and director Joe Wright are able to convey through images what it takes McEwan endless reams of paper to get across.  Here, an idea can be suggested through a simple shrug of the shoulders, a meaningful turn of the head, a barely noticeable gesture or wave of the hand.  And, indeed, the movie is rich in beautiful and unforgettable images that evoke a feeling, a time, a place, sometimes even an entire theme, all on their own.  Even though the screenplay remains faithful to the three-act structure of the piece, that structure comes across as less fragmented, less arbitrary and less self-conscious than it does in the novel.  Thanks to the seamless fluidity of Seamus McGarvey's stunning cinematography and the unifying tones of Dario Marianelli's brilliant musical score, everything in the film version of "Atonement" feels perfectly integrated and all of a piece.Of the performers, only Keira Knightley is in any way problematic.  She looks positively gorgeous as the seductive Cecilia, and there are moments when she achieves the proper mixture of tenderness and haughtiness essential to the character.  But she has a tendency to spit out her lines in a much too rapid fashion and her tight-lipped poutiness (a problem, too, in "Pride and Prejudice") eventually becomes annoying and distracting.  As Robbie, James McAvoy proves again why he is one of his generation's most exciting screen talents, while young Saoirse Ronan is remarkably poignant and poised as the 13-year-old Briony.  Ramola Garai and veteran actress Vanessa Redgrave do nicely as Briony in later stages of her life (although the ending, while moving, is a bit more reminiscent of "Titanic" than it needs to be).Wright is often at his best when turning what could have been mere technical "stunts" into integral pieces of the drama: a beautifully realized, five-and-a-half-minute long tracking shot of the carnage at Dunkirk, the effortless incorporation of a clicking typewriter into the musical score, a row of nurses marching in time to the rhythmic clacking.  Through sight and sound, Wright creates a surrealistic, dreamlike tone, perfectly appropriate to the material at hand.  What's amazing is that, even with all these stylistic flourishes, Wright never loses sight of the human drama at the story's core.  In his direction, he displays an astonishing economy of means, moving the story along at an almost breakneck speed yet never allowing the movie to feel telescoped or rushed.  Not only does his pacing not sacrifice the emotional resonance of the piece; it greatly enhances it."Atonement" ends on a lyrical note of melancholic uplift that leaves audiences wrung out and emotionally exhausted, as Briony engages in her final and greatest act of storytelling creativity.  Watching "Atonement" is nothing short of a rapturous experience.

$REVIEW.: I thought this movie was spectacular. Ridley Scott did a great job with the film location and the directing. Anthony Hopkins, yet again, did a great job as the bone-chilling Dr. Hannibal Lector. I also believe Julianne Moore did a good job acting out Clarice Starling. The Italy scenes were wonderful and Mason's home was beautiful. The movie had some spots that were gory but what can you do, it helped in understanding those parts. So if you dont want to make Hannibal mad, go buy this movie which has a great dvd. The dvd includes just about 15 deleted scenes, multi-angle views of how they shot certain scenes, behind-the-scenes featurettes, and much much more. It's the best two-disc dvd this year(2001)!

This is the weakest of the episodes, but still quite good.&quot;Breaking the Lease&quot; finds the Ricardos and Mertzes fighting after the Ricardos make some noise late at night.  Will the Ricardos really leave the building?  (I'll give you one guess.)Finally, the first of many personal favorites over the course of the show.  &quot;The Ballet&quot; finds Lucy once again trying to get into one of Ricky's new acts.  (How often do they change anyway?)  He needs both a ballet dancer, and a burlesque comic.  While most of this show is Lucy without the other regulars, it's really gives her a chance to show off her impressive physical comedy skills and always makes me die laughing.This DVD is a collector's dream.  The episodes are presented in their entirety, and they look and sound sharp.  There are occasional flaws in the picture, but considering the source material is 50 years old, it really isn't bad at all.  The sound is presented in mono.  While it won't challenge your sound system at all, it serves the purpose well and is faithful to the original audio recording.  I thought it sounded a bit off at times on this disc, but going back again, I didn't notice it.  Maybe that was just me.  The extras feature the original opening and cuts to commercials plugging the show's sponsor (the episodes themselves use the heart we're used to from reruns), info on the guest cast, some mistakes that made it into the episode, footage restored to the first episode, a couple trivia type notes on the last episode, and one episode of Lucy's radio show &quot;My Favorite Husband.&quot;This DVD shows why the show has become such a classic - absolutely brilliant comedy.  Even casual Lucy fans will want to have this disc in their collection.

$REVIEW.: Ashton Kutcher takes a break from playing his usual goofy doofus and takes a more serious approach in this time-travel thriller from the writers of "Final Destination 2"
Kutcher is Evan, a good-natured kid who seems to be suffering from blackouts
He uses a journal to document the events surrounding them in hopes of better understanding them

Many years later when he appears to have conquered his childhood problems, he decides to take a trip down memory lane and discovers that he has the ability to travel back in time by reading the journal entries

When he suffers a fatal tragedy in his life, he uses his newly-discovered powers to alter the past and subsequently change the future
Of course, the more he tries to change things the worse things get

Despite a lot of the negative criticisms the film received, "Butterfly" is actually an effective take on a classic Ray Bradbury tale
A good deal of the film is disturbingly sadistic and contains a good deal of scenes involving kids being hurt, kids hurting each other, and even kids hurting animals


Despite its far from uplifting content, it's a lot better movie than it gets credit for
The DVD contains two different versions of the film, the theatrical version and a never-before-seen "director's cut" with an alternate ending.

$review_text.: After a successful first year staring in January 2005, MEDIUM is now in its fourth year of interviewing ghosts and tracking down their killers.  It will return in January 2008.  When I first saw the trailers for the show, I didn't know if I would be all that interested.  After all, the concept of a psychic solving crimes isn't new and has been often times been nearly run into the ground by movies, books, and television episodes of characters that get haunted by apparitions.But "Do you believe in ghosts?" seems to be a popular perennial topic.  People love arguing over the afterlife and what shape it will take.  Interestingly enough, at the same time MEDIUM was airing, GHOST WHISPERER was already in development at another network.  GHOST WHISPERER focuses more on relationship-driven plots, but does occasionally deal with crime victims.From the very beginning, though, MEDIUM was all about the crimes.  Think of it as CSI with ghosts.  Court TV also offers PSYCHIC DETECTIVES, a reality-based recreation of criminal cases that were solved, or at least investigated, by real psychics.  There is plenty of interest in the subject, and the market doesn't appear to be nearing saturation yet.In fact, the show is based - somewhat - on the real life of Allison DuBois, a practicing psychic who once interned at the district attorney's office in Glendale, Arizona.  The character Allison DuBois, portrayed so charmingly by Patricia Arquette, is also a wife and mother of three daughters.  Haunted by her dreams and contacts with the afterlife, Allison is drawn to solving crimes.  In the opening season, she was met with staunch resistance but eventually won a position in the district attorney's office.Now in this third season DVD collection, Allison is an old hand at shepherding ghosts and solving crimes.  As she's gone along, though, the crimes have gotten more personal and hit closer to home.  Jake Weber plays Allison's husband, Joe.  He's, literally, a rocket scientist.  Together, they couldn't come from more different backgrounds, but they make everything work.  Their relationship is the backbone of this show, and Jake's reaction and struggles with dealing with Allison's "gift" is what brings me back again and again.I love how the whole family gets along.  Joe is adrift in a sea of estrogen and female stress, yet he's got his own problems as he battles job pressures and Allison's dreams that haunt them both at night.  Not only that, but the stress that Allison and his kids bring into his life isn't something he can talk about with any of his work buddies.  Allison is the hero of the show, but Joe is my personal hero.  The way he deals with everything, the way he's just one inch away from constantly being overwhelmed, makes me root for him all the time.Season 3 brings a lot of the action into the family arena.  The past couple episodes have touched on the family, but as the girls have gotten older and come into their own powers, more emphasis has been placed on that.  The girls - Bridgette, Ariel, and Marie - are amazing in their own right.  They're not perfect.  I like the fact that they come across as real kids with real issues and real rebellion at times.  Marie is played by Madison and Miranda Carabello.  Bridgette is played by Maria Lark.  Ariel is played by fan-favorite Sofia Vassilieva.The season opener is a two-part story, "Four Dreams Part 1" and "Four Dreams Part 2", has Allison and Bridgette working together to solve one of Allison's cases.  Marie's problems surface in "Profiles in Terror" and tie into Allison's battle with an abrasive FBI profiler whose findings don't agree with hers.  "Mother's Little Helper" focuses on Allison and Ariel as they share dreams.  One of the strongest episodes of the season is "Second Opinion" because it involves the possible future Marie, and Allison's fears.  Those fears are the same ones faced by many parents in the world today.  This one hit especially close to home for me because I've had to deal with a cancer scare with my own daughter.  This is the kind of writing that makes an episode of MEDIUM double-down with excitement and emotional weight.The episodes involving the volatile relationship Joe and Allison share are the best.  That relationship gets touched on in "Ghost in the Machine" as the result of a camera Allison gets for Joe as a present.  The idea of a camera (although it's a camcorder in this case) that can show images from the future or past isn't new, but the episode still manages to throw an edge on the story.  "Apocalypse, Push" reunites Allison with the Texas Ranger she first helped in the series' premiere episode, but it also features Joe as he has to deal with issues that again make him a real character to me and the show's fans.  "Very Merry Maggie" has Joe worrying about his health, and Allison is so busy that she can't give his situation or mental drain the attention she otherwise would.The best of the Joe-centric episodes come at the end of the season, though.  In "Joe Day Afternoon," Joe gets held hostage at his job.  The problems he has to deal with as a result crop up again in "No One To Watch Over Me" as he has to go back to work and still has a lot of residual fear.  "Head Games" and "Heads Will Roll" features Joe's decision whether to join a lawsuit against his employer.  I love Joe.  My heart goes out to him.  I know he's a fictional character, but Weber just plays him so well that I believe if he really existed, this is just how he would be.In addition to her husband and daughters, Allison also has a brother.  Michael has some of the same powers Allison has.  He's featured in "1-900-Lucky" where his job as a hot-line psychic leads him into the same crime investigation Allison's already working on.When the family isn't featured in the spotlight so much, the season relied on the fabulous and intriguing natures of the crimes Allison becomes involved with.  "Be Kind, Rewind" slams Allison with haunting dreams about losing her legs, and plays the emotional card that brings in the viewers.  Dr. Charles Walker, Allison's recurring foe that first appeared in first season's "Penny for Your Thoughts," puts in an appearance in this season's "Blood Relation."  These episodes are always chilling."The Whole Truth" is a heartbreaker because it involves Allison's search for a little boy.  These episodes where a ticking clock is involved always fuels the interest and I can't help but love them.  "Better Off Dead" has a twist involving ghosts that is fantastic and fun.  "Very Merry Maggie" is creepy, and shows how much the series can bounce back and forth between fun, interesting, and downright scary."The One Behind the Wheel" puts Allison at risk, and those episodes are always crowd pleasers.  I can't help but be more interested when Allison is menaced.  No matter what the other people in her life think, she's always alone ultimately.  "We Had a Dream" has a psychic killer who tracks her down to her home.  Allison's younger self puts in an appearance in "The Boy Next Door" and gives viewers a glimpse of what her life was like as she was growing up.  "Whatever Possessed You" has two investigations that ultimately pull together in a surprising way.The final three episodes of the season pull a lot of things together and build a larger, more emotional story.  "Head Games," "Heads Will Roll," and "Everything Comes to a Head" builds tension and the threat level to Allison, Joe, and their marriage as outside pressures threaten to cave in on them.  And Allison has to go outside her normal activities to bring a killer to justice.MEDIUM is an amazing show.  I love the episodes because most of them are self-contained and don't require constant attention to the series to understand what's going on.  You can dip in and out of the season and keep up - except for the continued shows.  But that's what I pick the DVD sets up for: to see the episodes I might have inadvertently missed and to revisit favorite episodes.If you're a fan of the series, the third season set is out and keep the same great standards as the first two sets.  If you haven't seen the series before, this season rounds out the series and makes the characters even stronger than before.  You can start here with this one and know what's going on.Unfortunately, special features are almost non-existent.  I would love to see some behind-the-scenes stuff, some interviews with the real Allison DuBois and maybe the district attorney she worked for, as well as background on real-life cases that the medium solved.  I love the show, but I would love finding out more about the real person it's based on as well.

$REVIEW.: Killadelphia is a fantastic DVD that captures Lamb of God in 2005 just as they were really breaking into the big time, with a mixture of documentary segments and a sixteen track concert that has a total playtime of almost two hours.The concert is of very high quality, the band deliver music from New American Gospel in a clear and professional way and give tracks from Ashes of the Wake an energy and rawness that improves them similarly. The band are brilliant performers and know how to command an audiences attention, when to play up to the crowd and also crucially when not to, in order to preserve the spirit of the written songs.Randy is the type of singer who you may expect might not be able to pull it off live, given the intensity, speed and complexity of what he delivers on record; but in reality his live performances are astounding, if anything better than on record.Performance is only one quality on which a live concert stands or falls, and thankfully a very strong performance is not the only thing which Killadelphia has to offer, the sound is terrific, with a very clear drum and vocal sound, heavy guitar tones and a good clear mix which gives each instrument a fair chance to shine without sacrificing much in the way of heaviness.Furthermore, the camera work, direction and editing, in addition to the lighting and stage show are excellent bringing a real excitement to the video without having to resort to cheesy wipes or frequent quick cuts like other concert DVDs sometimes do, but which only ever give the illusion of energy.On top of all this, the track list is excellent with tracks from each of the band's early albums together and performed to the highest quality. Then as if the concert wasn't interesting enough (and there is an option to play only the concert, plus a CD copy of the concert for added value) you get a really candid and informative set of documentary segments which are of the same tone as those on the band's Walk With Me in Hell DVD, and include the infamous fist fight which fans always seem to love.Overall, Killadelphia is a brilliant DVD, honestly one of the best metal DVDs on the market and an absolute must buy for Lamb of God fans.

$review_text.: There was a time when this opera was regarded as erotically graphic in a "crossing the line" sort of way.And it is that, truly--but times have changed, and nowadays it is just another fascinating tale of thwartedlove, as almost all non-comic operas are. This filming of a stage production in the Netherlands is superbin every way--very well sung (especially by the lead soprano, Westbroek) and played and an excellent recordof a brilliant staging. Basically, all you see is a unit set of a great big open box, but the director, MartinKusej, uses it imginatively. For instance, the start of Katarina and Sergei's wedding party shows all the guestsat a vast table, frozen in somewhat glamorous poses. Suddenly, they all go into real time, and the picture ofan elegant party instantly falls apart in rustic roughness--people crashing off their chairs, stuff breaking,etc. And the irruption into the scene of the police is a real stunner. Some reviewers have chided Ventris forlosing the hunk attitude he displayed on his earlier DVD performance, but he knows how the role should go. Ifound him a wonderful match for the soprano. What was especially interesting to me was the portrayal of Sonetka,the girl he takes up with at the end, as somewhat less than seductive. Normally she's a young cutie, but hereshe was more like the rest of the women prisoners. It suggested that Sergei isn't attracted to her as much ashe is attracted to the notion of being seen as a tomcat. I leave it to each individual viewer to decide whetherKusej found a solution to the problematic ending, which, like the one to Wagner's Gotterdammerung, really needsa river if it is to play properly.

$review_text.: Far beyond of all the praised comments and countless acknowledgments around the world, "The sorrow and the pity" still remains as one of the most striking testimonials of a recent past. The co production talks by itself:(French- Swiss-West German). Necessarily lengthy documentary directed by Marcel Ophlus about anti-Semitism and the Nazi occupation during the Vichy regime in the WW2  It's worthy to recall the French TV did not run the film for some time, because in the own words of a credited officer spokesman  "The population was not yet mature enough to accept the idea that during the WW2 most of Frenchmen did not fight in the resistance." Nevertheless, we should realize that it was not a mere coincidence the claasic film of Rene clement "La bataille du Rail" awarded the First Cannes Film Festival in 1946,  that mirrored the emblematic and even titanic facts  (perhaps minor episodes for some people) of  those railroad men, who by all their means caused many troubles to Nazi forces along France. They visibly did not fight against the virus of religious and racial bigotry ss the genial filmmaker makes incisively clear by interviewing dozens of people who lived those dark days of Hitlerism, whether powerful or not.Filmed in glorious Black & White the running time of  265 min, to be true, it is not perceived due the impressive and absorbing scriptA towering and supreme film.

$review_text.: I purchased this film for the aerial scenes of the US Navy's F-14's in action - valuable even more now that the F-14 is no longer with us on active duty

While several of the scenes are rather &#34;campy&#34; and would never have occurred in real life; nonetheless, it is an entertaining film and one worth keeping, again, if for no other reason, than the aerial scenes
I was a wee bit disappointed to see F-5's depicting &#34;MiG's&#34;, but I suppose that was the best that could've been done at the time the film was produced

Still, I'll give it a &#34;5-star&#34; rating.

$REVIEW.: Normally, when a particular movie captures my attention enough to where I'll wish to include it as part of my personal DVD library, my overall desire & intention is to acquire ONLY that specific title. But all too often I'm having to deal with DVD distributors who insist on "pairing up" or "piling on" additional feature films (often in the form of "sequels") with the main films I'm interested in with no way to circumvent it -- (examples include: "Silent Night, Deadly Night" paired with its gawd-awful sequel [whose ONLY redeeming quality was the "Garbage Day" scene]; "The Fly" remake paired with its not-so-bad but still not wanted sequel; and more recently the latest [and hopefully "final"] entry in the "JUON" legacy, "Shiroi Rouzyo" paired with the dull & inferior divergent companion piece, "Kuroi Syozyo").So as I sought to include the forgotten Boris Karloff classic, "The Man They Could Not Hang," as part of my library, it required me to purchase it as part of this 4-movie "compilation." In the end, however, the inclusions were like added "bonus features" which only served to enhance the viewing experience.Granted, we *are* talking about your average "B-rate" movies here, but for what they are, and considering the time period in which they were produced, they are mostly enjoyable.The "gem" of this collection is, of course, "The Man They Could Not Hang," not just because of my personal prejudices, but because it is in fact the best of the bunch. This story of a medical scientist wrongfully convicted of murder and sentenced to death is a bit more than just your standard "revenge from the grave" plot -- it has a nice bit of a twist to it, and could actually be considered the grandfather of the "Saw" and "Cube" series and similar type movies. - [[grade: "B"]]Next in line is a fun & clever (though admittedly not very humorous) "comedy" piece called, "The Boogey Man Will Get You," where Karloff attempts to perfect a process for creating "super men" for the war effort, but always with less-than "lively" results (inside joke: you've got to watch it for yourself to understand). Also features Peter Lorre as the township's "Every Man" (quite literally). - [grade: "C"]"The Black Room," the only movie in this collection not featuring Karloff as any sort of a "mad scientist" type, but still "mad" nonetheless, involves a struggle between twin Barons (both portrayed by Karloff) -- one "good"; the other "evil" -- and a family prophecy that could determine the fate of one or both of them. - [grade: "C-"]Then finally, "Before I Hang"... nearly identical title, roughly similar concept, with a few variations on the "Could Not Hang" story, where this time it does not involve a good man turned killer bent on revenge, but rather a good man turned killer based on a contaminated soul. - [grade: D]Overall, based mainly on the strength of "The Man They Could Not Hang," plus the addition of the extra features which gave a glimpse into some of Boris Karloff's more obscure works, I'll give the entire collection an impressive grade of "B".Enjoy!

$review_text.: When BONES first started out, I admit I was HIGHLY skeptical


 I was a fan of Kathy Reich's books and lets face it, Emily looks nothing like the character
 She seemed too glamorous and elegant! And the setting was out of whack, not at all like the books
 But I quickly became a fan!  The ensemble cast works well together and seems to me to be friends, which adds to the cachet

 I like it that one time characters ended up a semi permanent part of the story line, reappearing often


 And I found Temperance's quirks endearing...I've done the manuscript work for PHD's and know how they can be!  That she is so beautiful and glamorous and has these single minded quirks makes her fun to watch
 The other characters story lines are developed so watching a show is like catching up with a bunch of friends, but with a good story thrown in as well

I've gotten every one of the series, and when I can no longer see it on tv, I'll have it to revist again and again

 I'm not fond of many of the 'hot' programs and tend to buy up series I like so I can go back and enjoy them (LIFE and LOST being two in question)


 It takes something special to make me not want to do something else on the night a tv program is on no matter if I can HULU it or not later
 BONES does that.

$review_text.: Peter Jacksons epos is not only worth looking, its worth looking again and again. Return of the king is the final of a big journey into imagination. The only point I dont like is that certainly my own fantasies about middleearth would be with much less violence, so I would prefer to life in this world but in the peaceful time that will come after Return of the King. But finally, how could someone make a 9 hour movie in three parts about a peaceful time? Lord of the Rings has a lot scenes of war and violence, but its surrounded of wonderful characters and fantastic environment, thanks to J.R.R Tolkien.

$REVIEW.: With the help of a first rate cast, Sidney Pollock has given us an exciting, suspenseful and interesting film which should continue to please for years to come. Unlike many of the political thrillers which can last no longer than sharp memory of the event, this 'what lawyers can be' morality play has staying power. It is difficult to pick out any from among the important  players for their special quality, but if there is one standout, among superior actors it would have to be Gene Hackman, who exceeds the norm of professionalism he maintained over the years, until age finally retired him to write books. Tom Cruise is suitably heroic while retaining the qualities of a novice lawyer, which is tough when you are noted for being a sexy player.By this time, I am sure, the reviews have said about all there is to say, therefore, now a dozen years after its release, I can simply add, see it, nothing has aged or become tarnished from use in other films. You should enjoy it.

$REVIEW.: This production, performance and recording of Benjamin Britten's War Requiem marks the 50th anniversary of the commissioning of the new Coventry Cathedral, built to replace the medieval cathedral destroyed during the bombing of Coventry during WW2. The first performance was also played by the Birmingham orchestra as on this recording and featured an English tenor, a German baritone and an English soprano as commemorated here too. The original Russian soprano was not allowed to perform by the Russian government of the time because of the perceived political nature of the work.Britten made a particularly famous recording of the work within a few months with the LSO and with the intended original trio of soloists. This went on to achieve a quarter of a million sales, my copy being one of them. The work had been set as one of the works to be studied in detail as part of the music `A' level exam that I was engaged upon. I was so struck by the setting of Owen's poems that I then bought a volume of his complete poems that I still own.Britten's own recording was such a landmark both as a performance and as a recording that, even now, it represents a major challenge to any new recording of the work. That this anniversary recording is so successful is a remarkable achievement. That it is also by no means inferior to that of Britten's is even more remarkable even though there are some major differences which must be mentioned and which affect the balance of the overall effect.The two main changes relate to the much slower tempo of the Dies Irae in particular and to the Sanctus to a somewhat lesser degree. This may be the result of the venue with the large reverberation factor to consider or maybe just a difference in emphasis. As a result, whatever the reason, the two sections do not drive ahead dramatically as they do with Britten, but instead achieve an effect of weighty power instead. To my mind this is just as appropriate as the performance still manages to sustain tension, just a different sort.The soloists are all excellent with Mark Padmore communicating the Owen poetry with complete commitment and with tenor singing of the highest quality. He has a rounder tonal characteristic to that of Peter Pears. Hanno Muller-Brachmann makes for a fine baritone soloist who also sings with fine tone and without the accent problem detectable in Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau's delivery in Britten's recording. Erin Wall equally has a much more rounded tone than Galina Vishnevskaya on Britten's recording where her strident tones were always somewhat controversial. The choir is excellent in all respects as is the CBSO Youth Chorus.Apart from the two tempi variants as mentioned above, Andris Nelsons adopts an approach that differs from that of Britten by being rather less driven but just as dramatically effective. Coupled with the benefits of the warmer tonal characteristics of his soloists and the qualities of the far newer recording, the whole effect is rather easier on the ear and allows the listener/viewer to appreciate the message of the Requiem even more. This was certainly true of my wife who has now changed from being a `refuser' to a supporter entirely on the basis of this performance and recording. It seems to me that Nelsons has managed to catch the mood of today's audience and to provide a performance of the War Requiem that relates strongly to that. Perhaps this is less strident but more humane - a difference of historical period?The recording is visually strikingly crisp with wonderful detail of objects such as tubular bells, through more general shots such as larger groups of singers to distant views such as the youth choir positioned at the rear of the cathedral in front of the famous tapestry. This is one of the best visual recordings I have ever seen and, for me, marks a new level of visual technology. The sound is of equal merit, effortlessly encompassing the dynamic tonal range of Britten's endlessly imaginative scoring. In my opinion this is a triumph of the recording art as at present. It is presented in DD 5.1 and stereo. The surround sound makes telling use of the rear positioning of the youth choir as well as greatly aiding general clarity and sonic spread.This is a remarkable achievement by all concerned and is a wonderful 50th anniversary tribute to the new cathedral, to the composition itself and to `the pity of war' as Britten himself said. I am sure that it will communicate strongly on those terms.In summary therefore I would suggest that this is a performance and recording exactly appropriate for the current times that we live in and, as such, fully deserves to be seriously considered as a strong contender for purchase.* Thanks to James Kreh for underlining the DTS nature of the soundtrack wrongly printed on the disc cover.............................................Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:This review (and Amazon's back cover view as well) indicates that the audio is DD [Dolby Digital] 5.1. Fortunately this is incorrect. The graphics department at Arthaus erroneously copied the information on sound format from the cover art for the DVD. The great news here is that the 5.1 soundtrack is actually DTS-HD Master Audio encoded at 24-bit/48kHz, as one would hope to have with a contemporary concert recording on Blu-ray (although a few productions improve on these specs with 24-bit/96kHz encoding). By the way, the Arthaus Musik website has the correct audio information listed for this Blu-ray.I agree fully with the reviewer's opinion that "this is a triumph of the recording art", but that certainly would not have been the case with lossy Dolby Digital 5.1 sound! (U.S. review)I thought that you might like to know that before I buy a recording I now look through all the reviews to see if you have posted one. Your assessments and opinions are invaluable. Thank you. (US review)I particularly like your format of review. They give the prospective purchaser an idea of the style of the playing and relevant comparisons. They are succinct.

$REVIEW.: This, along with I Walked with a Zombie, is the best of the Lewton thrillers. A highly literate horror film it contains what is probably Karloff's finest performance. His performance is matched by that of Henry Daniell who plays a basically decent physician, tormented by Karloff's evil grave robber. Bela Lugosi has a minor supporting role as a none-too-bright would-be blackmailer who is &quot;disposed&quot; of by Karloff. This is a B horror film with grade A acting (by Karloff and Daniell), a grade A script and grade A attention to detail (set design, photography, etc.) Highly recommended. 3 1/2 stars.

$review_text.: Rated "PG".  Running Time: 1hr, 58 min.This is the second film in the Indiana Jones series, however the story begins in Shanghai, 1935, one year before the Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) mission.The movie begins with a lady nightclub singer, "Willie" (Kate Capshaw, who later married Steven Spielberg), performing in a musical production number that should have been filmed in Technicolor.Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is also in Club Obi Wan. He has to get these diamonds from Lao Che (Roy Chiao), but Lao poisons Indy and it becomes a brawl for the diamond and the antidote.Seems like Indy has a new lady partner for this adventure as he takes a hold of her hand and jumps out a window and ultimately is saved by his trusty 11-year old driver, Short Round (Ke Huy Quan, aka Jonathon Ke Quan).  Earl (Dan Aykroyd) leads them to a getaway air freight airplane.  Lao Che has the last laugh. It's his plane.And so the adventure begins.  I won't tell you any more so that those who have not seen this film can be surprised.You might think you're watching a Charlie Chan film, a Satyajit Ray film, or Lost Horizon (1937).Ke Huy Quan steals every scene in this film.Many people thought this film was too gross for children to see. This inspired the MPAA to later invent a new rating "PG-13" and the adult "NC-17".Won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and nominated for Original Score.Ke Huy Quan went on to do "The Goonies" and two tv series', "Together We Stand" and "Head of the Class".  You can see how he looks today by buying a DVD of "The Goonies" with the on-screen video portion of the audio commentary turned on.  Now known as Jonathan Ke Quan, he is currently a martial arts coordinator for films.Also in the cast: Amrish Puri, Philip Stone, David Yip, Ric Young, Philip Tan, Raj Singh, Nizwar Karanj, Bhasker Patel.All VHS and DVD's of the Indiana Jones film series are considered collectible.Followed byIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade (Special Edition)(1989)."The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles" (1992-93). Harrison Ford as "Indiana Jones" in 1950, made a special appearance in episode, "Young Indiana Jones and the Mystery of the Blues".Karen Allen and John Rhyes-Davies reteamed for the television special "The Making of the Indiana Jones Adventure". The Disneyland ride opened March 3, 1995. It has since been much improved. With three different fortunes, each ride is different.Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (Single Disc)was released May 22, 2008.Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kingsis available for Playstation 2, Sony PSP, Wii, Ninetendo DS.

$REVIEW.: The Shawshank Redemption is a movie I missed at the theaters


 I don't know why, but I just never got around to seeing it

 SR has developed a huge online following since then, and I've heard plenty of praise for it

 While the DVD contains no extras, I couldn't resist the price
 The other  reviews elequently describe this masterpiece


 But, I had to add my voice  to the choir and proclaim that The Shawshank Redemption is one of the most  terrific and uplifting films I've ever had the pleasure of seeing


 The  characters, story, everything is beautiful


 How this film lost out to  Forest Gump in the 94 Oscars, I'll never know


 SR will be regarded as THE  defining film of the 90's

$review_text.: With its predictable situations and stock characters, I am genuinely surprised that I ended up liking this 2005 movie, the epitome of a chick-flick with its veneer of Lifetime TV banalities. However, after a slow set-up, a closer look yields a frequently perceptive, often touching film that exceeds expectations on several levels. First, director Curtis Hanson, not known as a women's director given his previous works include "LA Confidential" and "8 Mile", has an idiosyncratic eye for the overriding themes of self-esteem, caretaking and inextricable sisterly bonds. Adapted from a popular chick-lit novel by Jennifer Weiner, the story focuses on two sisters, a study in physical and behavioral contrasts - Rose, a workaholic Philadelphia attorney who falls into the trap of an office affair with her slick boss, and Maggie, a seductive, dyslexic and ethically marginal party girl who cannot keep a steady job or a place to live.Their can't-live-with-her, can't-live-without-her relationship has an authentic feel, even if at the beginning, their increasing polarization smacks of stereotype. They have an explosive blow-out at which point the movie tracks their evolving lives on parallel paths. This is where the film's strongest section begins, as Hanson and screenwriter Susannah Grant do a nice job of showing how Rose and Maggie have similarities beyond their mutual fondness for designer shoes. Rose hesitantly starts a relationship with a former colleague unconditionally smitten with her, while Maggie journeys to Florida to meet and  live with Ella, the grandmother neither sister knew even existed, at a senior citizen community. Fulfilling the film's coy title, Rose and Maggie eventually merge paths toward an inevitable conclusion by ending up in each other's shoes. The emotional pay-off gratefully resonates as Rose becomes more free-spirited and outgoing, Maggie becomes more introspective and respectful, and both like themselves much more for the change.Hanson sometimes veers too far into soap opera but ultimately taps into the emotional honesty of the characters by eliciting three superbly rendered performances. As she has proven in films as diverse as "Dinner With Friends", "The Hours" and "Japanese Story", Toni Collette manages to get to the core of her characters with minimum fuss, and her Rose is an intelligently observed, warts-and-all performance. Tearfully pushing Maggie out of her life, she viscerally handles the plot's turning point like a wounded hyena. Collette also provides the film's funniest scene when responding to a humiliating slideshow, she wields a kitchen knife in front of her venomous stepmother Sydelle (played to the hilt by Candice Azzara). As Maggie, Cameron Diaz does unexpectedly strong work here as she demonstrates how far more resourceful she is than her fun-loving personality would indicate. Unafraid to lose viewer sympathy, she paints a rich portrait of a self-deluded young woman who gradually discovers that her self-worth extends beyond her obvious beauty.In an even more dramatic change-of-pace, Shirley MacLaine does not play Ella with the predictable bluster which mark her performances since "Terms of Endearment" but rather in restrained shadings that represent some of her most subtle work. It's a commendable turn by an actress entering the sixth decade of her illustrious film career. Not too surprisingly, the male actors are completely overshadowed, but given that, there is nice work from Mark Feuerstein as Rose's supportive boyfriend Simon, Norman Lloyd as the kindly blind professor who makes Maggie realize her inner strength, and Ken Howard as the sisters' resentful father. Brooke Smith plays Rose's cynical friend in a manner almost identical to the character she plays in Woody Allen's "Melinda and Melinda", and Francine Beers is on Estelle Getty autopilot as opinionated Mrs. Lefkowitz.The DVD includes three surprisingly good featurettes. The obligatory making-of short, "The People in Their Shoes", actually provides insightful comments by Hanson, Grant, co-producer Carol Fenelon and the principal cast on what motivates the characters and why the story evolves the way it does. The funniest piece is "A Retirement Community for Acting Seniors", which comically profiles the non-professionals who took part in the senior center scenes of the movie, while "From Death Row to the Red Carpet: The Casting of Honey Bun" provides a sincere look at how shelter animals are used in films, such as the puppy that plays Maggie's dog, Honey Bun 2. Surprisingly, there is no alternative audio commentary by Hanson or the cast.

$REVIEW.: I have loved this movie ever since I first saw it as a youngster in 1960, and I still feel a thrill every time that I see it. This is a wonderful transfer, with excellent color and sound, but if it is the "Director's Cut," (technically impossible, since the director, Wayne himself, was dead long before this release) it most certainly is NOT as been noted already, the full length, uncut, theatrical version. That does exist, and is available, but only as a 2 tape VHS set. Why doesn't SOMEONE go to the time and effort of issuing this immortal classic in its full length on DVD? Until they do, I guess the only way that fans of the Duke and undoubtedly his greatest movie, will have to settle for the older format.

$review_text.: Secrets of the Dead is an intriguing series as it explores events that occurred in the past ,recreating  historical happenings around the world, and providing fact-based explanations. One of my favorite episodes is the episode titled Escape from Auschwitz which recounts how two inmates at the Auschwitz concentration/ extermination camp managed to escape the camp and fulfill their mission - that is to inform the world about the atrocities occurring in the camp, i.e. the systematic murder of European Jewry (and others, including gypsies) through gassing and other deliberate means. It is a horrific tale, and quite disturbing.The show also features interviews with survivors of Auschwitz who provide first-hand accounts of some of the atrocities committed there, as well as interviews with an academic who provides detailed information on the men, Rudolph Vrba and Alfred Wetzler, who managed the impossible - to escape in the hope of telling the world what they had witnessed in Auschwitz.This is recommended viewing for those who appreciate quality documentaries that explore the past, especially significant historical events.

$review_text.: United States Champion Kofi Kingston vs. M.V.P. vs. Matt Hardy vs. William Regal - This was your average match that was fast paced & did it's job as an opener with a few botched "crash & burn" spots but nothing special past that.No Holds Barred Match: Intercontinental Champion Rey Mysterio vs. Chris Jericho - One of the best feuds of the year (if not THE BEST just based on the matches alone) continue here as they stuck the formula that was worked with great wrestling that had the fans get more into it and added the No Holds Barred element well here but didn't overdo it using a mass amount of weapons as only a chair was used.  The crowd got more into it as time passed & had a very creative finish that also makes sure this feud will continue...and that's not a bad thing, that's a good thing! (thanks DDP)  Match of the night for me.Strap Match: C.M. Punk vs. Umaga - This is one of those one of those matches where the gimmick hurt the match more than helped and the being absolutely dead didn't do it any favors either.  This was under the "touch all four turnbuckles" stipulations & there really isn't much to say or remember here except that this ended up being Umaga's last match in WWE.Extreme Rules Match: ECW Champion Christian vs. Jack Swagger vs. Tommy Dreamer - This was "do or die" for Tommy Dreamer as we would leave WWE if he didn't win the championship here.  Tommy Dreamer went back to his "Innovator Of Violence" ways here by coming up with some different ways to use the weapons & breaking out some of his old spots which lead to the first "ECW" chants I've heard in WWE in a very long time.  This was a very fun match & the emotional aftermath was well deserved as well.Hog Pen Match for the Miss WrestleMania Crown: "Santina" Marella vs. Vickie Guerrero - I'm going to be honest, I never found Santina to be funny & I didn't even watch this...I pressed the skip button right away since the only noteworthy thing here was that this turned out to be one of Vickie's last appearences as she quit the next night.Steel Cage Match: WWE Champion Randy Orton vs. Batista - For those who didn't already know, Batista had already reinjured himself (after being back for around 2 months) going into this match so it was kept short but because of that.  Despite all that, this turned out to be their best PPV match because it had the high impact & intensity that their previous matches were lacking.  It was a dominate performance by Batista that resulted in the first ever time the WWE Championship changed hands in a steel cage match...it you don't count the Elimination Chamber back in Feb.  This was good concidering how Batista was injured.Submission Match: John Cena vs. Big Show - This was the second match that was a rematch from Judgment Day that used the same formula in their previous match...however, this gave up the complete opposite result that the Mysterio/Jericho match did as this is possibly the worst feud of the year so far.  Cena was again getting dominated by Show for what seemed like forever before he made his comeback & even had a finish with the STF that got botched.  Another match that I would press the skip button on because these two just don't have the chemistry that they had 5 years ago.Ladder Match: World Champion Edge vs. Jeff Hardy - I'll give credit in that they've tried to do what Jericho/Michaels did at No Mercy in delivering a different type of ladder match than the usual "non-stop spotfest" that we're used to seeing.  They tried to find new ways to use the ladder in this match along with revisiting old "highlight reel" spots from all their previous ladder matches.  Again, it was a good match but it wasn't the blowaway classic everyone was expecting...but to be fair, they've set the bar so high for the past decade in regards to ladder matches that they just couldn't top it in this case.  This was one of those matches where if you judge it on it's own instead of comparing it to all of their past ladder matches (I counted at least six) then it's a good match.  But the major story at the end of the night was the aftermath that resulted in a new World Champion...AGAIN!The only DVD extra here was a post-match interview with Chris Jericho setting up the next stage in their feud.  In the end, this ranks right around there with the 2007 edition as one of the most dissapointing editions of this PPV because there was just as much good here as there was stuff that's either bad or easily forgettable so this is one I would recommend for a rental & make your own call here.

$review_text.: I thought it might be interesting given that I like both Douglas, although he has a tendency to get involved in many roles that are really retentive. I also like Bean's work and so I thought why not see what is happening in this one.With the opening sequence I thought I might have made a good choice. Then the screen says that it is now 10 years later and we see Dr. Nathan Conrad on his way home from work. After he chats with his wife about their turkey the next day, which is Thanksgiving, he receives another call from the lockup from a fellow shrink.This is where things start to go wrong. First of all, when he sits down with Elizabeth, who has been in psyche lockup for the past 10 years, he immediately is taken by how she is not presenting with diagnosis from past or present. That is our first clue that things are not exactly as the other shrink indicates. Then it really gets messed up. The following morning his daughter has been abducted and the race starts. First of all, I am going to assume that 'you have till 5&quot; is only for control purpose by Patrick or is it because the red diamond, which I assume also is a diamond because a red ruby that size would not be worth $10 million in any gem shop.....is going to self destruct because it is has been 10 years of searching for it? Who knows. We are also lead to believe that the entire apartment is bugged in less than one day? with his wife flat on her back with a cast on her leg all the time it is being bugged? Did she not think it odd that someone was bugging it? And many other things that do not add up. Meanwhile, they have dragged a body from the river and we now have a detective trying to sort out the missing woman. In the end the doctor determines that he must get Elizabeth out of lockup so they can now go to where it all happened. When they show in slow flashbacks what happened 10 years before in the subway, we see her father pushed down in the tracks and then ultimately stumbles directly into the path of the oncoming train. And most importantly the three who did this, and who are still after her now, were apparently arrested by the platform police at the time. There were apparently many onlookers when it happened. So why are they free? Are we lead to believe the police just released them and told them not push anybody else in the path of a train?Finally when he figures it out where the doll is, that contains the ruby, he receives yet another call from Patrick who tells him he has three minutes? And the doctor tells him he has the item and no more clock running. That is what I would have told him to begin with. When Patrick asks where he says &quot;You know&quot;. Well if he knew all along why didn't he just go get it?Bottomline is that it lays an egg all the way thru.I give Douglas and Bean credit for sticking it out. If they felt as frustrated with the plot line, they at least did not show it on the screen.

Jessica Chastain was miscast or everyone else was, because there was &#34;no connect&#34; between her and all the supporting characters

Nothing was &#34;true&#34; therefore I couldn't suspend judgment and enjoy

$REVIEW.: This is has become my favorite movie of all time
There's something about the connection between the main character 'Hiccup' and the dragon 'Toothless' that surpasses all other "buddy films" in recent memory
The depth of the story almost makes it a drama, but my emotions while watching this film ran the gamut


The animation, of course, is beautiful

If you did get to see it in the theater in 3-D, then you got a treat

One of the few movies using 3-D appropriately
But, nothing is lost watching a "non 3-D" version

Part of the magic that makes this a 5-star film is the soundtrack/score


Seriously well done.

$REVIEW.: When I first heard about Rwanda and the massacres in the spring of 1994, I wanted to do something about it and was horrified that America wouldn't get involved, mostly because of our bad experience in Somalia just 6 months earlier as well as still deep-rooted racism that is apparent in our media and military actions (the recent Tsunami disaster another example). Shamefully, our country (as well as Europe) views the problems of Africa and most of Asia (beyond the Middle East) as not worth much to sacrifice our lives. Because we ignored the problem and allowed the massacre of nearly a million lives, it is important to have books and movies speak out about this crisis. For that reason, I am grateful that this film was made.Though the similarities to "Schindler's List" are apparent (like Oskar Schindler, who saved 1200 Jews from the Holocaust, Paul Rusesibagina, a Manager of the Hotel Milles Collines in Kigali, Rwanda, managed to save 1200 Rwandans--the Tutsi minority--from being slaughtered). Paul used whatever cunning and lies he could to save his people at every little setback...which included bribery, booze, desperate calls to the Hotel chain's European financial backers, and outright lies to the Hutu General about his being on the U.S. hitlist for war crimes. This film shows that in desperate situations, situational ethics applies, as a strict moralist would likely end up dead. Using personal relationship with thugs to save lives is a lot better than any sanctimonial denouncement of the thug's behavior.Don Cheadle is amazing in this film, as he nails the accent perfectly. The scene where he breaks down and cries after having seen the devastation of the massacre with his own eyes is heartbreaking to watch. If not for Jamie Foxx's phenomenal performance as Ray Charles, I think Don Cheadle would have deserved the Best Actor Oscar this year.The song "Million Voices" by Wyclef Jean is a hauntingly beautiful tribute to Rwanda, as it encorporates a children's choir and relevant lyrics about the human disaster that remains part of Rwanda's historical legacy. After the Holocaust, many people vowed, "Never Again!" would they allow such genocide to take place...yet as we have seen from history, it happened in the Soviet Gulags, on the killing fields of Cambodia, in Bosnia-Hercegovina, in Rwanda, and now in Sudan. Films like these are important to bring about awareness, but in the end, its really a calling to us, daring us to take action in whatever way we can.The DVD features a short documentary on the real Paul Rusesibagina's return to Rwanda, as we see the horrible preservation of some bodies (at first, I didn't realize I was looking at human remains...they looked like white plaster statues of stick figures). In a way, such a preservation will probably force people to remember, as the human tendency seems to be towards, "it never happened." We must remember what evil is capable of achieving...and that it was possible to slaughter half a million people by machetes alone. See this film and may it fill you with a hope to act out whenever injustice rears its ugly head, in whatever form it takes.

$review_text.: Seven Samurai is one of my all-time favorite films, and I was very much looking forward to watching the blu-ray version.  After firing up the blu-ray player, however, I was surprised by the amount of film grain present.  Also, the blacks were washed out in places, and sometimes the picture flickered as though the light in the projector was ebbing.  When I stood closer to the screen, scratches were evident--as though the film had been viewed too many times.  This was not typical blu-ray quality.  Nevertheless, I soon got caught up in the movie, and everything was fine.When the movie ended, I popped in my old DVD version for a few minutes, just to compare.  Then I realized how superior the blu-ray edition really is.  The DVD version was really bad--lots of artifacts, dirt and "noise."  These things had been cleaned up in the blu-ray edition.  The detail in the DVD was so muted that it was hard to watch.  The blu-ray edition is indeed superior when it comes to crispness of detail.  The sound is also much improved.  So Criterion's blu-ray is in fact the best version of the film.  Just be forewarned: the restoration and transfer is not nearly as good as, say, Casablanca.  Perhaps technology will advance to the point some day when they will be able to make a pristine edition of the film.Parental Advisory: This movie contains medieval-style warfare, and many die.  Killing scenes are bloodless, however, and often concealed from view.  There is one scene where intimacy between unmarried individuals is implied, but not shown.  The film also contains some minor language and drunkenness.  It is suitable for junior high age and up.I highly recommend this movie.  It is a "must see."

$review_text.: This movie was a huge disappointment, in my opinion.  The mission (rescuing a doctor who does not want to be rescued) is absolutely ridiculous, especially after sitting through the whole thing to find out why she was so important, and still never finding out.  The ground tactics were embarrassing....mistakes that even the greenest of Basic Training graduates would never make.  Who in their right mind would think it was a good idea to stand upright and walk right into 300 enemy soldiers who are firing on you?  No wonder they got chewed up so badly.  The only redeeming value of this movie is that it MIGHT open the eyes of SOME people to the atrocities that are going on in Africa even as we speak.

 Ignore its few minor flaws like the ship-models-in-washtub special effects


 And the slow pace would offend only those with the attention span of a two-year-old

 On the contrary--the movie takes the time necessary for expansive character development

 What makes this movie special is its realistic depiction of military command, life, and relationships

 Viewers with no military experience will get a little taste of military life--its nobility, gentility, courage, stoicism, and occasional mendacity


 It is a good study in command, like "Twelve O'Clock High."Twelve O'Clock High (Special Edition)One of the benefits of serving in the military is life experience--including meeting all kinds of people, good and bad

 That's the case in this movie
 And John Wayne gives another iconic portrayal of what it means to be an American and respond to great challenges.

$REVIEW.: For some reason I got the soundtrack to this iconic, cult classic stuck in my head the other day. That's when I realized the tragedy that I didn't have this in my DVD collection. I had to fix that immediately! This movie makes me feel young, as when the world was new, to quote another favorite movie. Seriously though, it brought me right back to midnight movies in high school and college. It brought back those interactive nights throwing toast and squirting water guns in a theater. And it brought back my brother getting his first hint that his baby brother was gay. Ah, good times! If you haven't ever seen RHPS, or if your only exposure to it is one episode of Glee, do not buy this DVD yet. Find a midnight showing of this movie somewhere near you, preferably near a large university, and GO. This movie must be seen in a theater late at night with people in costume in order to be truly appreciated. And you actually need to go several times before you can get the full effect. This DVD reproduces this theater experience to some extent, but you'll never truly 'get it' until you walk out of a theater at nearly 2 in the morning with rice in your hair next to a guy in a corset and heels.

$REVIEW.: Dead or Alive is an extremely violent and disturbing film by Takashi Miike who also directed the challenging Audition (2000) and alarming family drama Visitor Q (2001)


 In this film Miike tells a story about a gang of young reject Chinese immigrants who are &quot;lost&quot; in a foreign society


 Under the leadership of Ryuichi, the gang attempts to regain their position in society by creating their own place, which becomes a dark area in the criminal world

 In their search for belonging, they openly display their insolence for authorities and the Yakuza, since they cross paths

 This leads the gang members onto a bizarre and sadistic path


 Dead or Alive is definitely not a film for everyone; however, underneath the gross and ugly there is a distinct message in regards to society

 This message enhances the cinematic experience, but there are several cinematic infractions besides the brutality that hurt the overall cinematic experience.

$review_text.: When the James Bond spy thriller, 'From Russia With Love', was released it came to myattention, as a young boy, that the Catholic Church's Legion of Decency had banned thisfilm (Also banned that year, 1964, was, "Of Human Bondage"). This is a PG rated film andas usual the Special Features disk is not rated.Now, I had read all the Ian Fleming 007 books and loved the almost pulp nature of theirpresentation. Bond was not as sophisticated in the books as he was presented in the filmsbut when you are a young teen viewing beautiful babes and violence galore who caredabout those details.When I saw the list of banned movies posted at my church I decided to see this film. I wasjust old enough to get into the film and loved the gritty, fun attitude it exuded. The film, tome, was the best Connory/Bond he had ever made. Characters were more fleshed outand the bon vivant attitude of the protagonist was much more refined.I think 'Goldfinger' started the bad habit of Bond films going over the top on special stuntsand bits. But that's another film and issue for another time. Although, "From Russia WithLove" did introduce the 'gadget' Bond, which became a trademark part of each Bond filmfor decades afterward.The budget on this film had been doubled from the Dr. No production due to the incrediblesuccess of Dr. No world wide. Len Deighten had been screenwriting 'Russia' but was replacedby two writers from Dr. No., who appeared to have worked on a faster time schedule for theproduction team.One of the better casting coups was Lotte Lenya as Rosa Klebb. The director had hearda musical recording of hers and like it so he cast her. True? Don't know. Makes for a goodstory though.The film was restored frame-by-frame and contains DTS 5.1 Dolby Surround sound audio.You can also play the film in the original mono if you so choose and are feeling a bit nostalgicfor the old cold war mentality...and sound.  The film is presented in 1.66:1 widescreen andlooks wonderful; clean and clear.On the second disk, Special Features, there is an interview with the book's author, Ian Fleming.Mr. Fleming had actually worked for MI5 for a short time, or so he said. Whether this was apress agents imagination at work or Mr. Fleming's, who really knows. He allegedly was a deskjockey and allegedly did no 'field work' at all.There are also original trailers, TV spots and Radio communications included on the specialfeatures disk as well as Audio commentary from the director, Terence Young, and members ofthe cast and crew.If you were to see only one Connory/Bond it would be this one. Less frivolous than those thatfollowed and yet better realized than the first, Dr. No. In short ,it is just a lot of good oldfashioned fun served up with a wink and a smile.

$review_text.: This early 90's effort is arguably Rodney Dangerfield's last truly great comedy. He's in top form in this one as an engaged working class guy who agrees to coach the "Ladybugs" girls soccer team to finagle a promotion from his boss & better support his future wife (Ilene Graff). Soon, he discovers how deep over his head he's in---the team is a disaster. That is, until he convinces his teenage future son--who has natural skill as a player--to don drag as new member "Martha" & whip the team into shape. So it sort of functions as a "Tootsie" on a soccer field as both must keep up the charade in order to have a winning season & impress the boss with his coaching.Jackee Harry gives fine comic support as Rodney's sassy assistant, and even the late child actor Jonathan Brandis has some very good moments. Highlights: A scandalously hilarious bit in a girl's dressing room; Brandis frantically switching from boy clothes to drag (several times) when both his Mom and the girl on the team he likes are under the same roof; Rodney donning drag himself to rescue Brandis from a potentially disasterous "skinny dipping" session with the girls; Rodney rattling off some of his one-liners in traditional fashion; the soccer action sequences; Rodney finally standing up to his boss with the great line, "What good is it to be the best when it brings out the worst in you?"; and Rodney's unforgettable closing gag (I won't spoil it for you!).A fun & breezy comedy, "Ladybugs" definitely scores!

$review_text.: After seeing Mrs
Warren's Profession, it's hard to imagine it being a banned play especially since it's subject matter is mostly implied


Most of the characters are appalled by it and the end is sort of a triumph for morals and the low opinion of people who have a wicked past

It seems to be rooting for everything that is Victorian-for high society, the improvement of women and setting the example for proper behavior and shunning those-even people who are loved should they partake in questionable activities
Some of Shakespeare's plots are a thousand times worse than this--Titus Andronicus anyone?-and I don't recall them being banned in Victorian England
Unless it's because the perpetrators here are women or because the hypocrisy of Victorian society was under fire and of course ...that will never do


In any case, "Mrs

Warren's Profession" is a battle of values..or virtue..and both of them make a pretty strong case


Will Mummy be put in her place or will her daughter be kicked off her high-and-mighty pedestal? The final scene will blow you away
The cast are all veteran stage actors and they thoroughly understand Shaw's language and pacing especially Robert Powell-who is hysterical as the sharp-tongued, passionate, neighborhood fop
Powell also appears in the bonus feature "You Never Can Tell," another Shaw comedy


In that one, while there were some good moments, was a little exhausting
It's worth seeing for more of Powell's witty banter-something he obviously enjoys and also for Judy Parfitt who always gives such solid performances (see her in Jewel in the Crown or Dolores Claiborne)

Both productions are low budget and sometimes with other BBC productions, movies filmed on stage sets can be a little jarring, but the setting on these films is rather charming and it becomes secondary, to these wonderful, brilliant actors.

What I criticize is the non-HD picture I got watching on Prime. I tried the usual tricks, such as pausing to buffer, even stopping and starting; but nothing worked until I paused during the credits, and then I got HD. Great timing. While there are any number of possible reasons in the world of streaming, I was still disappointed. I don't usually have this issue with Prime, so chalk it up to bad luck. Somewhat forgettable Bond entry.

$REVIEW.: How cool is Neil Young? He writes an album, creating a piece about a fictional California coast town, then produces, shoots and directs a film of it. Essentially a lo-fi series of videos for the album, the film is edited out of chronological order, aptly telling the story of Greendale, CA, USA. Very creative and interesting, if not slowish at times. But it remains under two hours and hell, its Neil Young music with visuals. Praise!If you love Young, you'll like this, if not it may be a stretch. But his willingness to communicate his feelings for small town life, the turmoil of mistakes and unlawfullness, the tribute to family, marriage and love, and the commitment to fighting the good fight are all here.

$REVIEW.: From Smother Magazine smother.net:Made by Vincenzo Natali, the director of the delightfully twisted underground hit "Cube", "Nothing" is a bizarre spectacle and study of human friendships. The movie follows two absolute loser guys who through a series of unfortunate events are in trouble with the law. Oh and did I mention that their house which boasts two super highways in between it is poised to be destroyed by the city with very short warning? But wait, this isn't even the bizarre part. Just when they're cowering from the tear gas and having reached the point of seemingly no return, they blink. And everything outside is gone. They're left with a bunch of nothing. White. Bright whiteness. Everywhere and as far as the eye can see. Soon they realize that it was because they hated away their problems. They found the bliss in their nothing world. But soon the two work out their own internal conflicts that have resulted from years of friendship and pent up emotions. Bouncing heads are indeed funny and you'll have to watch the movie to know what I'm referring to. And you better get this movie.

$REVIEW.: This "movie" has major problems (not just compared to the original which was a much better movie).1)You won't really care about the characters because they're not developed...at all.  It's basically: here I am, lemme have a gun. [no motivation for anything they do or the way they act both the good guys and the bad guys].2)Because of the lack of character in the characters you basically have cardboard cutouts of people such as in a VIDEOGAME.3)The bad guys end up being more interesting than the good guys, no really.  They introduce marines near the end of the movie and you're thinking "these seem like pretty interesting guys with a lot of stories to tell"; they basically say nothing then they kill most of them off in the next 10 minutes; the remaining marine says a one liner then leaves in a helicopter but they don't show the helicopter leaving because they didn't have the money for it (apparently).4)The plot goes NOWHERE, the ending is "we ran out of money here's the credits".It's just an awful cardboard cutout of a movie (cough...a videogame in live action) that really accomplishes nothing; even for an action movie it doesn't really work because it goes NOWHERE.  Nothing is resolved.  It's watchable for the action but if you think about it at all, it will start to annoy you; I can't see how the "ending" wouldn't annoy everyone who sees it but there are some really stupid people in the world.
$SUMMARY.: Action is decent everything else not so much

$REVIEW.: I can't believe I'm about to say this, but I preferred the animated Disney version of this story to the 1946 Jean Cocteau film.  I'm no Disney fan, and I would personally like to stop them from taking over the world (along with Starbucks), but this is one case where I just thought they instilled this fairy tale with more magic.  I missed the character of Gaston in the Cocteau version, and I missed also the delightful assortment of animated objects.  And I think this story is particularly conducive to being set to music, and I enjoyed the songs in the Disney version.However, on its own terms, the 1946 release is well done, and considered by many to be the definitive version of the beauty/beast tale.  I thought the acting was bland, though Belle is indeed a beauty.  And there are moments of pure movie magic: the candelabras that light Belle's way, the fireplace that watches her father eat.  And for once slow motion is used in a way that doesn't feel cliche.  But the relationship between Belle and the Beast isn't well developed.  You don't see Belle falling in love with him over the course of the film, and when she professes her love at the end, it seems to come out of thin air.  And was I the only one confused by the transformation at the end?  It doesn't get explained well at all.  Though it is kind of funny at how blase Belle is when the Beast becomes a hunk and says she'll have to get used to his new face.The film is interesting in that it acknowledges the Beast's animalistic nature.  He hunts wild game, he craves blood, and more than once you wonder whether or not he'd rather eat Belle than court her.  There's a violent eroticism underlying this film, that I found surprising for the year it was released.I know Cocteau asks his audience at the film's beginning to watch the film with the eyes of a child and to give itself over to the enchantment of fairy tales, and I have no problem doing that.  But even so, I felt like he was using fairy tale logic to explain away things that could have been explained better.Grade: B

$REVIEW.: Thomas is a vain and self-centered fashion photographer in London during the swinging sixties. But he obviously wants a life with deeper meaning--he poses as a factory worker to take gritty black and white photos. And one day he gets out of his Rolls-Royce (or is it a Bentley?) and wanders aimlessly through a park snapping photos.Thomas' desolate photos of the empty park show his loneliness and ennui. But as he develops the photos, he discovers that he may have photographed a man's murder. The dead man whose photograph Thomas takes in the park represents the deadness of Thomas' own emotional life. As he compulsively enlarges the photographs in search of the "truth" of what happened, a beautiful, mysterious woman, Jane shows up and demands the negatives. Jane also seduces him; this is a reversal of Thomas' usual exploitative relationships with women--she's turned the tables on him. Thomas, perhaps for the first time in his life, is truly emotionally engaged. But Jane takes off with the negatives and his prints and Thomas is left alone again, but now with a new capacity to feel. Where he goes with it is up to him. Of course, since this film is by Antonioni, it's visually mesmerizing and what "happens" is beside the point--Antonioni's films are always about a process of becoming. His characters have a way of never reaching their destinations. In Antonioni's films, the journey is the destination.Blow-Up is also about the sense of time passing--Thomas and Jane are young and beautiful, but their youth is as elusive and fleeting as the mysterious images Thomas takes in the park. The dead man Thomas photographed is middle-aged; it's an omen of Thomas' future he has to face and accept. Antonioni's mod London looks quaint and dated today--but in a way that only increases the film's allure. Like all of Antonioni's films, it's a quirky masterpiece.

$REVIEW.: For my son of 15, who, curiously enough, was the first person to recommend this film to my wife and I, Schultze represented something of a German middle-aged version of the quirky yet entertaining main character in the eponymous film Napoleon Dynamite.  The seemingly buoyant DVD cover together with excellent reviews accompanying the DVD package further piqued our interest. We were not disappointed. And we were also very grateful that our son did not reveal the film's ending.People who know something about Germany - its society, people and culture - are more likely to appreciate Director Michael Schorr's remarkable gifts as he portrays the setting, mood, pace and undercurrent of the film. I found Schultze Gets the Blues to be a most intriguing, engaging and deeply sensitive film! The plot was brilliantly conceived. Horst Krause is endearing as the recently retired accordion-playing salt miner, Schultze, who, freed from the daily drudgery of the mine, finds himself in search of a new direction. Schultze's accordion becomes the medium through which we witness his metamorphosis. He discovers Zydeco on a local radio station. (Stop here if you don't wish to have the ending revealed.)It is a joy to witness Schorr's direction and Krause's performance during the transformation of Schultze's musical yearning away from the traditional, predictable and perhaps rigid ump-pa-pas of German polka to the much less readily discernible free-flowing rhythm of Louisiana Zydeco. Schultze has found a musical form that will serve as an allegory for the individual freedom that he is seeking.In the Louisiana Bayou, Schultze's spirit is fully cast.  Schultze ultimately finds both Zydeco and freedom at the precise moment that his life is cut short. Spiritual and musical life in the bayou may be arousing and satisfying, but conditions are poor and the lifesaving medical care that Schultze would have surely received in Germany is nowhere in evidence in the Louisiana Bayou. As with too many people who live in this inherently dangerous planet, Schultze's life, but not his spirit, has been overwhelmed by menacing natural forces surrounding him. We are reminded that freedom and safety are not synonomous.In the catastrophic wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, we are reminded further of the inherent fragility and socioeconomic imbalances of life in the Gulf Coast region - and of the advisability of each of us grasping as much of life as our bodies and spirits will allow.Schultze's last vision of this world is one that has been liberated by the redeeming melodies and rhythms of Zydeco. And while Schultze's final moment may have been fleeting, it nonetheless radiates, representing the ultimate triumph of a poignant, yet unique and independent spirit.

$review_text.: This comedy is set in Washington D.C., smack in the middle of WW II...1943 to be exact


At the time, Washington D.C

was one of the busiest and most crowded cities in the U.S


The housing shortage was at an all time high, with homes, apartments and hotel rooms at a premium

 It wasn't unusual for hotel lobbies, train stations...even park benches...to be filled with the overflow of people unable to find somewhere to live, or to stay for a night
To remedy this, many opened their homes by renting out rooms as a way of contributing to the war effort

This is working premise of "The More the Merrier".Retired millionaire, Benjamin Dingle (Charles Coburn) has turned up several days early for an important meeting in Washington and finds his reserved hotel room unavailable

Forced to find accommodations elsewhere, the wily Dingle wanders through one of Washington's parks and sees a statue of Admiral David Farragut and his famous words, "Damn the torpedoes! Full steam ahead!" Taking this as a sign, he uses this inspiration to connive his way into the apartment of Constance Mulligan (Jean Arthur) a single, attractive and very patriotic young woman who has placed a "For Rent" ad in one of the papers and is ready to sub-let her apartment

She's determined to rent to a woman and is reluctant to open her apartment to a "strange" man
With some quick talking and ready cash, however, Dingle gets Ms
Mulligan to relent for one week

Within moments of his moving in, Dingle asks Ms
Mulligan why she isn't married...doesn't she want to be married? Would she be interested in marrying if an upright, honest, strong, down-to-earth type should happen along? And so Dingle's role as Dan Cupid begins and the plot thickens.In a very short while, Joe Carter (Joel McCrea) arrives on the scene, drawn by the same "For Rent" ad


 Dingle spots him before Ms


Mulligan does and immediately sizes him up as the upright, honest, strong, down to earth type perfect for our heroine and sub-lets his half of the apartment to Joe...without Ms


Mulligan's knowledge or approval, of course


The plot thickens and so do the laughs
This is considered by most to be one of the finest comedies of the 1940s


Directed by George Stevens, known by many for his superlative color WWII documentaries and his movies directing the wonder team of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, this film is his absolute best

The entire cast is perfect, with Charles Coburn winning an Oscar for best supporting actor
Jean Arthur is sensational and portrays Constance Mulligan in her unique way...incredibly sexy and demure at the same time


Add to this the fact that she was one of the few actresses during this time that could pull-off playing a woman in her 20s while she, herself, was in her 40s! As for Joel McCrea...known for his droll, understated acting...he plays Joe Carter with wit and humor that really lets his talent shine.The chemistry between McCrea and Arthur is palatable and this movie must have set a lot of hearts a fluttering

With women movie goers out numbering the men, this was perfect fare for all those love starved, male deprived women in the viewing audience
This movie is downright sexy...truly...more than almost any movie of its time...certainly any comedy

The scene on the apartment steps where Joe is trying to put the moves on Constance is one example, but the best moment is in the apartment

Only a thin wall separates their bedrooms, with their beds "meeting" up against this wall
In one pivotal scene, Stevens has managed to "bleed out" the wall, so it appears that they are actually in bed together
This was heavy stuff considering that the Hays Office at the time censored anything that showed a married couple in the same bed...let alone an unmarried couple


This was Steven's very clever way of getting around this and boy does it work! I know it may be hard to believe in this era of anything goes that something so seemingly innocent could be so erotic, but it was...is!With an incredible cast, masterful direction, a great screenplay (Garson Kanin worked on the screenplay and it shows, although he's not officially credited) and wonderful cinematography, "The More the Merrier" is one of those movies any fan of Hollywood's Golden Age should have in their collection

If you're not sure you're ready to purchase it, see if your local library has it in their collection, or check TCM for their next showing...but, do yourself a favor and watch this movie

Dimes to dollars you'll end up purchasing it, it's that good
Enjoy!

$review_text.: Full Moon, the wonderful company that brought us such titans of terror as Puppet Master and Demonic Toys, brings us another story of little things that kill, Doll Graveyard. Unfortunately, this movie lacks some of Full Moon's pervious luster.The dolls are horrible, scary, and full of gruesome ways to kill someone, the plot is nice and formula (loner kid who's into action figures is shunned and picked on until the puppets help him take on his bullies) but the poor finish, choppy editing, and odd lapses in continuity detract from the over all picture. The film has the feeling of a school paper that no one proofed before it got turned in.Don't get me wrong, it's good to see Full Moon back in the saddle and swing of things after not tackling the demonic puppet/doll genre for a while. I'm glad they took a swing at it, but trying to compare this movie to the early work of the Puppet Master series is too harsh. This movie can't compare to that horror classic. Still, compared with the stuff that Lion's Gate and Asylum are cranking out, it's not half bad.So if you want an hours worth of brainless fun, this is your movie. If you're looking for something that makes sense or will scare you, look for Puppet Master 1, 2, or 3 or Demonic Toys.Recommended for C horror movie buffs and Full Moon Fans.

$REVIEW.: Hitting its stride midway through Season One, "M*A*S*H" emerged as a well-oiled machine in the fall of 1973. Producers Larry Gelbart and Gene Reynolds maintain an ideal balance of irreverence and poignancy in classic episodes such as "Five O'Clock Charlie," "Radar's Report," "The Sniper" and "A Smattering of Intelligence." You could not ask for a better serio-comic ensemble than Alan Alda, Wayne Rogers, McLean Stevenson, Loretta Swit, Larry Linville and Gary Burghoff - with memorable visits from Allan Arbus (as psychiatrist Sidney Freedman) and Edward Winter (the paranoid CIA operative Colonel Flagg). Though the second year was uniformly strong, the 4077th reached its creative apex in Season Three. After years of butchered syndication prints, all 24 episodes are gloriously uncut and the DVD enables you to dispense with the obtrusive laugh track.

$REVIEW.: I watched this the first (and only) time around in late 1977.While time hasn't always been kind to this series, it has much to offer the contemporary viewer.The original source material, the sci-fi novel "Logans Run" by George Clayton Johnson and William F

Nolan was dark and edgy to the point of being unfilmable


 Still, after years in development hell Michael Anderson/Fox tried in 1976, and came up with a far more memorable interpretation


 If you're part of Generation X, who DIDN'T think of this movie on their 30th birthday?  Still, despite some striking imagery, the movie strayed far from its source material.That trend continued with the short-lived series

 Gone are the palm flowers, ultra-violence, the computer, and much of the setting from the film


 Such was the necessity for a late 1970s network produced effort
 That didn't stop some very interesting stories from the likes of DC Fontana, Harlan Ellison, and even William F
Nolan himself from taking their new take to our TV screens


"Crypt" particularly stands out.That said, the DVD set is a final, long-awaited addition to the collections of many TV science fiction fans
 It certainly has it's drawbacks - while the writing was occasionally strong and the special effects good for it's time, DVD reveals the low-budget nature of the sets (no wonder much of the series seems to be set in Southern California chapparal.)  Also,  have reasonable expectations - this set appears to have been mastered from syndicated prints, and the age/dirt/grain show


 However, it's still quite watchable, and of course, recommended.

$REVIEW.: in my opinion, season four is a fitting coda to the Charmed that we knew and loved way back when. While Shannen Doherty is certainly missed, Rose McGowan does a great job stepping in her shoes. Season four is the shows most controversial season it seems, hated by Prue fans because it's a Paige season, and hated by Paige fans because the show is darker and not overtly campy and childish as in latter seasons... I personally loved this season.Season four picks up not long after the death of Prue in the season 3 finale "All Hell Breaks Loose", Piper and Phoebe find out there is another half-sister out there named Paige, who is coming into her witch powers as well. The two main arcs during this season are Paige accepting her destiny as a Charmed one, moving in with the Halliwell sisters and the doomed relationship between Cole and Phoebe. I've noticed a lot of Buffy fans who are critical of the relationship between these two because it somewhat mirrors that of Buffy and Angel, but I don't understand it. I love both shows but Cole was darker than Angel because he chose many times to turn to the dark side, while Angel's soul was sucked out of him because of a moment of happiness.Starting with the fifth season of Charmed, the show lightens up quite a bit and becomes more fantasy driven, it's fun for a few episodes but those of us who saw how GOOD the early episodes of Charmed was lost interest once this change of events takes place. In this sense, season four is the last season of Charmed I plan to own on DVD because for me, everything ties up perfectly and I am not so wild about the show it became the next season.

$review_text.: In this wonderful film Jimmy Stewart is Willy Kruger, a lonely and aging widower, who lives in a basement apartment with his cat George

After finishing his work for the day as the custodian for the building, he ventures out on Christmas Eve to buy a tree


Returning home, he falls asleep listening to an LP by The Mormon Tabernacle Choir, dreaming that he is conducting them in carols of the season


When he awakes, he finds some carollers outside his window and he beckons them to visit him offering hot chocolate but they leave after only one song


Willy then finds two tiny mittens left behind by Clarissa, the youngest of the carolling group, and he puts them on his Christmas tree
On their return for the mittens, Clarissa invites Willy to join them and her mum realizes that they really need a bass voice to fill-out their singing before finishing the evening with a turkey dinner.Mr

Kruger's Christmas is a short movie that has captured superbly the spirit and true meaning of Christmas

Willy Kruger honors the tradition and his child-like excitement is contagious!  He takes us on an amazing  journey to Winter Wonderland where he drives a sleigh, helps decorating a giant Christmas tree and making a snowman,  and conducts a choir

And while arranging the figures of his nativity, he finds himself in the manger for the very first Christmas

This is very emotional moment and the choice of  "What Child is This" song for the scene couldn't be better!  Willy apologises for not bringing a present, only to realise that this isn't important


 He knees down  and thanks the infant Jesus for always being there for him and gives Jesus his love -the most  beautiful present of all!Jimmy Stewart's  performance as Mr
Kruger is breathtaking!  His humility, his joy, his tears and his admiration of Jesus are genuine and deeply touching


He brings me to tears every time I watch the film


 His profound message couldn't be more timely, because we are loosing it


We've become too practical, too materialistic, too inconsiderate  and too ignorant, and we need to be reminded of the core values- love of country, love of family, love and taking care of the weak and helpless and most of all, love of God

And we need to be reminded  of the true meaning of Christmas
It is not about eating, drinking and countless parties
Christmas is sacred- it is all about Love!

$review_text.: The Five-Year Engagement's biggest strength is the chemistry between Segel and Blunt (whom I love). I was expecting a few more laughs but found the film to be quite touching and heart-felt. I sincerely hope this is a breakout role for Chris Pratt, who absolutely owns every scene he's in, along with co-star Alison Brie. Some scenes drag on a bit, and the movie as a whole could be shortened considerably, but all-in-all it was an enjoyable movie with a good message about marriage and love.

$review_text.: Recently I have been lamenting the lack of quality adventure films in the vein of Back to the Future and Indiana Jones; I feel the Pirates series satiates my cravings

Jerry Bruckheimer, the producer, is known for over-the-top movies that defy belief so much it's distracting to the story, but perhaps director Gore Verbinski has toned him down a bit
Pirates is still over-the-top excitement, but it really doesn't distract from the storytelling the team of writers maintain

I'm not sure what went on in developing the final two chapters, but Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann end up in the adventure somewhat as an aside - Dead Man's Chest is really Jack Sparrow's movie
I could go into the story, but it seems pointless, the story is linear and the characters seem to develop almost forcefully


There are detours in the film that seem to only exist for spectacular adventure and could easily have been cut from the movie, especially when it ends at over 2 and a half hours in length


The cannibal island act didn't do anything for the story except to bring together four characters from the previous film
It seems like they couldn't figure out how to get these people in the story any other way
Honestly, the characters all come from different places and all end up on the same island together just to be chased about by cannibal tribes-people (some of which looked like Irishmen)


Some of the characters were introduced in this film seemingly for no reason, but our main characters seem to be quiet fond of them
Besides some weak elements, as mentioned, everything was amazing

The story drew you into it with compelling drama, suspense and adventure
The action was exciting and big (true to Bruckheimer's pedigree)
The vistas were amazing; filmed on location in the Bahamas
The most impressive part of it all was the innovative, cutting-edge CGI effects


It is amazing to see how far computer generated images have come over the years.

$review_text.: Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, has been portrayed on film more than any other historical figure in American history. From the silent films of 1911, to the upcoming Spielberg movie with Daniel Day-Lewis, Lincoln has been on film well over two-hundred and sixty times. There have been many great actors in the role, including Sam Waterston (inGore Vidal's Lincoln, which I feel presents the definitive screen Lincoln), and Gregory Peck (inThe Blue and the Gray). One of the few actors to portray him in more than one different film or miniseries has been Hal Holbrook. I first saw him portray Lincoln in Books One and two of the MiniseriesNorth and South. There, Holbrook gave a warm and wonderful portrayal of Honest Abe. But I did not know that those two miniseries were not his first time portraying the character. That came eleven years before in this six-part miniseries from 1974, the first of its kind at the time.Based on the Pulitzer Prize winning book by Carl Sandburg, this miniseries presents a really strong portrayal of Lincoln. From his time as a Prairie Lawyer, to his last days as President of the United States, Holbrook shows a wonderful range as Lincoln, capturing his sense of funny storytelling, his strong emotions when confronted with death, and his strong determination to win the war at all costs. The supporting cast does a fantastic job as well. But when one approaches this series, be aware that it is not a straightforward story being told chronologically. The story shifts from various points of Lincoln's life and Presidency from one episode to the other. It is best to be viewed as a series of "vignettes" that take a look at certain aspects of the story of Lincoln. And it does seem that trying to view it in any sort of chronological order will be nearly impossible. Nevertheless, this is a fine look at the life and Presidency of one of America's greatest leaders. If you enjoy American History, then you will enjoy "Sandburg's Lincoln."Program/DVD Grade: B+

$review_text.: Like Dandelion Dust is a dvd that relates the effort that the main characters, a married couple, cope with having adopted a child and not being able to procreate on their own.  I think that the film would have benefitted from tighter editing as it seems to become repetitive in relating the story of infertility.  It could be upsetting to those couples who are in the process of trying to adopt.  Otherwise the film does depict the trial and error of adoptions which can cause upsetting consequences for the natural birth mother and the adoptive parents.  Anna M.

$review_text.: The first contemporary film made by Sam Peckinpah, whose five previous movies were all westerns, STRAW DOGS, in its study of how one seemingly mild-mannered man (in this case Dustin Hoffman) can be driven to defend himself through extreme violence, can, in my belief, be classified as a sociological and psychological horror film.Released in late 1971, at the same time as Stanley Kubrick's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, STRAW DOGS caused an enormous amount of debate on both sides of the Atlantic concerning not only its violence, but also the horrific rape scene involving Hoffman's wife (Susan George), which got the film banned in England, where Peckinpah made it.  Both Kubrick's and Peckinpah's films differ from each other, in that Kubrick's is a more political allegory and Peckinpah's is philosophical--and yet both films are, in their own ways, masterpieces.Peckinpah, in a stroke of pure genius, with the exception of the hideous rape scene, holds off on his typical slow-motion violence until the climactic siege, where Hoffman has to protect a mental patient (David Warner) from a band of drunk hooligans.  This sequence is still nerve-shattering and violent, brilliantly edited, shot, and acted, with Peter Vaughan making for one of the most frightening heavies ever.Besides the acting, the other fine points of STRAW DOGS are the ominous cinematography of John Coquillon, who also shot the low-budget 1968 British horror film THE WITCHFINDER GENERAL, and a brilliantly haunting Stravinsky/Herrmann-influenced music score by Peckinpah's favorite composer Jerry Fielding.  STRAW DOGS is not an easy movie to watch or to like, but for those so inclined, it is very much worth seeing.

$review_text.: Saint Hildegard von Bingen get the star treatment in this wonderfully evocative film of her life. Hildegard is one of a number of unusual medieval women, who bucked the male-dominated church hierarchy to establish monasteries and gain prominence. Barbara Sukowa is absolutely stunning as Hildegard. She plays her with a combination of toughness and vulnerability that captures Hildegard's fierce internal drive as well as her deep emotional needs. A relationship with a younger nun borders on desperate attachment, but never crosses the line into the erotic.Hildegard was a pioneer in music and medicine. She wrote chants that are still enjoyable today. Her medicine, based on herbs and precious stones, may not be as useful today as it was in her day. But in combination with her certainty and tender patient care, it likely inspired the confidence that allowed healing to begin. Hildegard was also an able political tactician, playing off donors and supportive bishops against her clerical enemies.The film didn't do as well with portraying the vast difference between the medieval world and our own. Superstition, ignorance and extreme piety were extreme and accepted. While the film does show self-flagellation and spurious medical practices, it shows characters reacting much as moderns would - with revulsion at self-injury and bland acceptance of the power of crystals. And little was said about the value of Hildegard's heavenly visions, upon which her reputation hung. Probably a good thing - they might have made her seem silly or offputtingly pious. I wish too that more of Hildegard's ethereal music had made it into the film.But, given that I knew next to nothing about this extraordinary woman before viewing this work, I am grateful to have a visual peg to hang my future reading about her. The Catholic Church has just named her a Doctor of the Church. That alone should bring interest in her life. Though "Vision" tones down the strangeness of Hildegard's belief system and work, it is not a bad way to get to know her.

$review_text.: This was not the first film version of this great George and Ira Gershwin musical, but it was the best.  It had been a huge hit on Broadway, with Ginger Rogers in the lead role (a fact nodded at by changing the female lead from Molly Gray to Ginger Gray).  It was the final and best of a half dozen or so musicals that Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney made together in a very short period of time.  It isn't that the production was so much more lavish than the previous films, but the blending of several absolutely stellar Gershwin songs with the combined talents of Judy, Mickey, and Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra.We have to be honest here:  the plot is nothing to write home about, like a host of other musicals (until the late 1940s and early 1950s, the majority of film musicals were rather thin on plot).  The story, such as it is, is a frame upon which to hang songs, and luckily there are a host of songs.  This is not exactly the original songs as performed in the stage version of the show; some of the weaker numbers being replaced by stronger Gershwin numbers.  At worse, the numbers are highly entertaining, but a few of them completely transcend the typical productions in most of the Garland-Rooney MGM musicals.  Judy Garland had few moments in her career as splendid as when she sang "But Not for Me," and almost the same thing could be said for "Embraceable You."  "I Got Rhythm" is one of the finest numbers that Judy and Mickey ever did together.  I am not a fan of the big bands ( I mean the swing bands, not jazz orchestras such as Duke Ellington's), but I make a bit of an exception for Tommy Dorsey, and the numbers his orchestra covers in this film show why.  "Fascinatin' Rhythm" features a marvelous arrangement, and gives wonderful moments for many of the wonderful soloists that filled his band.  My lone complaint is that Dorsey himself doesn't do as much playing as I would have liked.  Though he wasn't a great jazz innovator, his technique on trombone was simply amazing, and he managed to transform the instrument from a bleating horn to a subtle, beautiful, and lyrical instrument.This film is also an important transition film in the careers of both Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney.  It was the last film that they would ever do together, after having starred together in a host of youth musicals in the previous few years.  It signaled the beginning of the decline of Rooney's career.  He would go on to make a huge number of films in his career, most of them rather minor parts, and he would from time to time score a very fine role, but from this point on his and Judy Garland's careers would be moving in opposite directions.  In their first film together, Rooney was the big star and Garland the newcomer, but immediately after this film Garland would be catapulted to stardom in a host of great MGM films throughout the 1940s.  But this also signaled the end of a period for Judy Garland.  She is so pure and innocent looking in this film that it almost breaks your heart.  It was essentially her last film as a teen (though she was 21 at the time).  Her next film would be MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS, and it was during this film that people began giving her the drugs that would play such a large role in the rest of her life.  She would remain fresh and beautiful looking in her next several films such as THE CLOCK and THE HARVEY GIRLS, but eventually the strain would take its toll.  But not in GIRL CRAZY.  Her face is a marvel of innocence and loveliness.  I'm not sure she was ever more beautiful than in this one.

$REVIEW.: This flawless masterpiece was far ahead of its time and is the work of genius.  The fact that it was banned in France for decades speaks for itself: Kubrick hit an exposed nerve with his stunning realism and searing  indictment of military discipline sacrificed to professional and political  ambition.As the First World War passes out of living memory, it is on  the way to becoming a &quot;forgotten war.&quot;  _Paths of Glory_ captures  the horror and futility of that war, which included the self-inflicted  savagery of brutal military discipline, particularly (though by no means  exclusively) in the French Army.  Set in 1916 on the Western Front, when  slaughter had become the order of the day, this film chronicles a doomed  infantry assault and the French practice of &quot;decimation&quot; of  disgraced units.The infantry assault on an impregnable German position  known as &quot;the Ant Hill,&quot; pre-dates by decades Spielberg's  [justly] acclaimed Omaha Beach landing scene in _Saving Private Ryan_, and  is every bit as horrifying as the French &quot;poilus&quot; are ripped and  blown apart by artillery and machinegun fire.  And throughout this film,  one never even sees a German soldier.  The French never make it beyond  their own barbed wire.The subsequent court martial of three soldiers  chosen at random to be tried for &quot;cowardice in the face of the  enemy&quot; is a mockery, the hopelessness of which parallels the failed  attack.  Kubrick's focus on the last night of the condemned and their march  to execution is sickeningly realistic.Every scene in the film is  effective as Kubrick explores the meaning of heroism and cowardice, both  physical and moral, through the lives and deaths of soldiers.  While  brutal, the film is also filled with subtlety, social commentary and  several compelling subplots.I have shown this film in the course I teach  on Military Justice.  Beyond the reaction of horror at the doomed infantry  assault and indignation over the injustice of the executions, I have  discerned some muttered gratitude for the Uniform Code of Military  Justice.Filmed in black and white, this stark, lean film is superior  even to Kubrick's excellent _Full Metal Jacket_.  It should be required  viewing for every Officer Candidate, and it deserves considered viewing by  any who truly aspire to the title of &quot;citizen.&quot;  What Kubrick  reflects, here, has been the implicit cost of nationalism in this century.

$REVIEW.: There are two reasons why Sarah's Key is one of the best films I've seen in the last 20 years
First is the wonderful combination of direction/screenwriting

The director clearly understood his material and the screenplay is nothing short of brilliant


As we were leaving the theater, I said to my girlfriend, "This is the best use of flashbacks I've ever seen." I was alluding to the seamless interaction between the two plots, the World War II story and the contemporary one


By the end of the film, they are one story.The war story is that of a Jewish family sent to the camps by the French - not the Germans

A little girl locks her younger brother in the closet to save him from being deported with the rest of the family


(The "Key" is the key that opens the closet.) The result is a tragedy from which she never recovers
The modern tale of a couple whose lives become strangely connected to the deported Jewish family allows us to revisit the Holocaust from a fresh perspective
Personally, I found it compelling.What really fascinates me here is that the reviewer in the unimpeachable New York Times wrote this: "Sarah's Key is undone by its very premise: that the two stories it tells can coexist in the same film." Is it possible that this reviewer and I saw two different films? If I were the publisher of the Times and saw that review in my paper, I would waste little time in finding a new reviewer
(I am available.) For me, what the Times reviewer saw as the film's fatal flaw is its most admirable quality

As it shifts from one plot to the other and back again, Sarah's Key is nothing short of captivating


The bottom line is that I was never bored, not for a moment
At one point, I found myself not just crying but weeping uncontrollably

However, I did not come away from Sarah's Key in a mood of depression

Quite the contrary, the film communicated to me that no matter how horrific things get, the life force goes on
The message is ultimately uplifting.The other quality of Sarah's Key that impressed me was the acting, from the top down to the smallest role (the soldier who helps two prisoners escape)

The child actor who plays Sarah is simply astounding

But it was Kristin Scott Thomas who really knocked my socks off
This is an actress whom I actively disliked in The English Patient and Four Weddings and a Funeral
After seeing this film, I confess that I must have blamed her for the flaws of the characters she played in those films instead of recognizing the quality of her craft

In Sarah's Key, she turns in one of the finest performances by an actress in recent memory
The intelligence and subtlety of her work is an inspiration to me as an actor (I am a member of Screen Actors Guild)

This film should be seen just for her work alone.



$SUMMARY.: The key to cinematic perfection!

$review_text.: The V.I.P. lounge of the London Airport is cunningly designed to exploit the real-life Burton--Taylor romance... In itself, the film is competent rather than stimulating...Liz (very lovely to look at) once again is the neglected wife, comforting herself with a lover... When he's threatened by his wife's departure, the husband, who has given diamonds instead of affection, shows he cares... Liz is unyielding, however; she wants him to suffer... Only when Burton decides to kill himself and she finds out does she realize he needs her... The couple are reunited: despite their great wealth, despite his previous indifference, despite her temptations (Louis Jourdan is waiting in the wings), they are respectable, conventional people after all...The inevitable reconciliation is reached by means of improbable coincidences... But the details hardly matter... The Burtons behave like stars, he shamelessly working his speeches as though they were Shakespearean arias, she being very dignified and remote, on her best lady-like behavior after "Cleopatra." At the end, she has a tearful scene that gives her the kind of torrential emoting she had practiced since "National Velvet" and "The Courage of Lassie;" for the rest, she's cool and serene, her face undisturbed by normal human expression... Playing an instigator of male insecurity, she's not, for a change, altogether sympathetic here...The Burtons by no means dominate the movie, and again, as in "Cleopatra," the chemistry isn't quite there... He has that deep sonorous voice he's so immensely proud of; she's working with her high, little-girl breathiness... He's stage-trained, an emphatic classical actor... She's movie-trained, skillful at not giving the camera more than it can absorb... His bombastic language and her movie-fashioned subtlety do not mix; often they don't seem to be occupying the same movie space...Burton was one of the finest classical actors of his generation, but as a movie actor in movie star material, he was no match for his wife... When they have good scripts, with equally weighted parts, as in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?," and "The Taming of the Shrew," they are truly responsive to each other...In "The V.I.P.s" Burton gives too much and Taylor just barely gives enough, but it doesn't matter... It's Old Hollywood pretentious and a big-cast movie like this is only as good as its supporting actors... Maggie Smith, as the unsophisticated secretary with a crush on her boss, and Margaret Rutherford, as the eccentric duchess, stole the show and won a Best Supporting Oscar...

Why not a hamster or a turtle?Horror movie? Let me think. The first half hour is watching a swimming pool vacuum move about. Second half hour - same thing with added falling kitchen utensil and kitchen cabinet doors opening. Third half hour the remote toy car moves and a couple of people get special effects dragging for a few seconds. End of movie with the usual disclaimer that someone disappeared - see the above number.

$review_text.: A movie containing lots of profanity about the reaction to a movie containing lots of profanity, &quot;South Park: Bigger Longer, and Uncut&quot; is also on the short list of THE funniest movies ever made.  This movie manages to remain hilarious even after repeated viewings (I'm at about eleven and counting) by taking everything that makes the TV show such a romp and carrying it to even greater levels of excess.  About five minutes in, when Terrence and Phillip break into a seemingly impromptu song and dance number whose name I can't repeat, it's obvious how much fun Trey Parker and Matt Stone had letting loose with everything they couldn't put on TV.  Blatantly calculated to please the show's fans and appall its detractors, &quot;Bigger, Longer and Uncut&quot; celebrates political incorrectness at every turn.  Pushing the show's penchant for subversion to new heights, the movie simultaneously manages to turn profanity into a plot device and an art form.  The first half of the movie is especially devastating, with the walking id known as Cartman unleashed in all his greedy, racist, foul-mouthed glory before his wrath is short-circuited by a V-chip.  The onslaught of naughty language and gross-outs could become numbing in a less intelligent movie, but fortunately the satirical edge that has always characterized &quot;South Park&quot; is completely intact.  Human nature in general and American culture in particular are given a massive sendup, with special attention devoted to the insufferable moralizing of hypocritical censorhip advocates that's best exemplified by Mrs. Broflofski's immortal line, &quot;horrific, deplorable violence is okay, as long as no one uses any naughty words!&quot;  And even when it's not slicing and dicing some aspect of modern life, the movie comes up with enough zany, inspired details to evoke continuous laughter in all but the most uptight viewers.  A must-see if there ever was one.

This movie is for anyone who has ever felt the passion of collecting or experienced how thrilling research can be, and wants a change from the usual Hollywood heroics.The audio and video quality on the DVD is good, and the disc has a lot of bonuses, my favorites being Polanski's full-length, in-depth commentary on the film and the 'gallery' which allows you to scroll through the 'LCF' and 'AT' engravings... which are reproduced in fairly low-resolution, unfortunately.In the end I suspect 'The Ninth Gate' will recieve much the same treatment as 'Vertigo'- be misunderstood by its contemporaries and be rediscovered several decades later when its outstanding production features, superbly constructed plot and acting are finally recognized. I hope history remembers this film as being one of the best of the late 20th century, as well as one of the most revealing of our culture's psychology.I think the sheer number of people who feel compelled to comment on it testifies to its ability to effect people... even if they do hate it.

$review_text.: This tape is a great beginner's introduction to Pilates.  Ana Caban is a good instructor (a bit on the &quot;trendy&quot; side), and her gentle reminders to correct your posture are well-timed and helpful.  Her partner in the tape demonstrates each of the exercises, modified for a beginner.  Very clear demonstrations.I have done other introductory Pilates videos, and I find this one really good because it introduces the exercises to you as individual movements, labelling each of them on the screen as you progress through the tape.  You will get &quot;the lingo&quot; after watching this tape a few times (great if you plan on taking a formal Pilates mat class).The program follows the classical Pilates syllabus, starting with &quot;The Hundred&quot; (an isometric abdominal exercise) and progressing to exercises like leg circles, rolling like a ball, and the corkscrew.  Overall, Pilates is a great workout for releasing tension in your spine, tightening your abs, and lengthening your arms, legs, and torso.It is a great alternative to jerky, weight-dependent strength training, because it tones and doesn't add bulk.  It is also a very relaxing workout...no stressful movements, no fast pace, and all exercises are mat-based.  If you're just interested in learning more about Pilates and getting in a decent strength-building workout, this video is definitely a must-try!

$review_text.: The Flash is probably the most unappreciated super heroe series to ever hit tv. It stars John Wesley Shipp (Dawson's Creek, The Never Edning Story 2) as Barry Allen who's a scientist for the police. One night there's an accident in the lab that leaves him being able to move extremely fast. A scientist at Star Labs named Tina (Amanda Pays) helps him learn how to control his new powers. A former cop who now has a dangerous gang, kills his brother who was the head of police. So in the pilot, The Flash must put the person who killed his brother behind bars.The show is fun and one of the few comic adaptations that has the feel like you're actually watching a comic book being played out. The fact that Danny Elfman who has done the musical scores for comic based films such as Batman, Spiderman and the Hulk does the theme music helps the show out a lot as well. Don't get me wrong, not every episode works in this show but it gets stronger as it goes on. You have Mark Hamil as the Trickster doing a similar voice as he did as the Joker in the Batman Animated Series. Too bad they won't dub Heath Ledger's voice and have Hamil talk for the Joker in the next Batman movie lol. The 2 appearances by him are worth checking out. The Captain Cold episode is pretty good as well with a hired bounty hunter that freezes people to death. Ok he's not Mr. Freeze but certainly his character is better done than the Mr. Freeze we got from Batman & Robin.This show just shows how boring people are that watch tv lol. I mean how didn't this show get ratings. The sad part is that Smallville gets more  ratings than this show did. When the Flash is just a straight forward comic book show without whining and complaining more than action. John Wesley Shipp isn't a fantastic actor but he was a really good Flash anyway. He had the right look for the part and did manage to carry the show just fine. I'd love more straight forward comic shows that take the material seriously like this does. But if they were on the same night as a reality show, sadly they'd get canceled as well. Because if this show didn't make it in 1990, I'd hate to see it now against the lame and over-rated American Idol.

$review_text.: Buried somewhere deep within WESTENDER'S meandering script there's a good story waiting to break out.  And so for over an hour-and-a-half I watched and waited for that to happen.  Sadly, it never did.  WESTENDER is the story of a disgraced and disillusioned knight's struggle to come to terms with the brutal death of his beloved wife and his own identity.  There are a few quick flashbacks, but most of the backstory is left to the viewer's imagination.  There seems to be a war on, and the King desperately needs the sword of this once-great fighter, but Asbrey of Westender just wants to be left alone with his personal demons.  We follow Asbrey on a long, tedious trek through towering forests and barren desserts where he encounters jesters, hermits, and a strange otherworldy dog while haunted by visions of his wife and past wars.  On paper the plot doesn't sound half-bad, but in practice very little about it actually works.  Most of the film is simply one scene after another of Asbrey walking...and walking...and walking.  Nothing much ever happens to break the monotony.  The acting is respectable and the cast seems earnest, but to no avail. There's just not enough story here, and too much down time.  There is a little action mixed in, but not much.  A couple of characters who seem like they're going to be pretty important just disappear and never come back.  Asbrey's visions are sometimes rather interesting but also very cryptic and never fully explained.  The end of Asbrey's journey is abrubt, unconvincing and a hopeless anti-climax.  What just happened?  What, it's not over, is it?  Yes it is.  WESTENDER is obviously low-budget, but better characterization and more drama could have made up for that.  I've enjoyed many fantastic tales of heroic quests over the years, but WESTENDER may be the worst fantasy I've ever seen.  Poorly paced and awkwardly written, WESTENDER'S journey is best left unfollowed.

Whenever the arguments and situations got heated, it brought more of the characters out in the open.Fireproof's supporting cast includes members from Sherwood Church in Georgia.

$REVIEW.: Such a cute and touching tale.  Luna falls head over heals in love...not for Artemis (sorry man) but for a scientist.  Guess she likes the intellectual types...especially when they save her life.  Although love is in bloom in december, the scouts have a new problem and enemy on their hands.  an evil ice queen is trying to freeze over the entire earth and add it to her collection of frozen planets...immediatly the scouts step up to meet the threat...but the only way to defeat her is my the legendary silver crystal power of love and friendship....will sailor moon use the silver crystal and forfeit her life to save the planet? Not if the scouts can help it!Okay, thats a brief summary of the basic plot...but there is so muchmore to say about it, but sadly that would take up an entire page...not to mention i dont want to give away what will happen or what comes of Luna's new love.  But here are some tasty tid-bits...THIS IS THE ONLY ANIMATED SAILOR MOON WHERE YOU WILL SEE LUNA IN HER HUMAN FORM...thats right...Luna goes homo-sapien and it gets better...not only are the original scouts in this movie...but so are sailor neptune, uranus, and pluto! The outer senshi fight along side our favorite sailors!  Not too mention this plot is so enticing it literally sucks you in full force with suspense and action...making you sit on the edge of your seat wondering..."will luna get with her new fling....will artemis be able to steal her back...and will the scouts succeed in their endeavors?"Here are some feature of the disk you may like to know-Bi-lingual English and Japanese-English subtitles-Art galleries-Character Profiles-Uncut-And more!Running time is approx. 60 minutes with a 13+ rating, mostly due to violent fighting in the last battel scene, and seeing Luna a bit nude when she turns into a human.  One note on the last battel scene, i believe it to be one of the best battle scenes ever made in sailor moon...it gets viloent and downright mean as it should...so of your into good battles....this is one of the best.

The movie is very amusing, the acting is very good, and the whole cast has something funny to say.It is also very unbelivealbe. I have no problem with fiction. It just seems that Analyze This was ment to be a more realisic film, but instead the flim makers chose to make it very silly about a half an hour into it. I think the end could have been much better too, but at least Robert De Niro, and Billy Crystal always seem to give it their best.

$REVIEW.: The second film together of Saoirse Ronan and director Joe Wright help cement Saoirse's fame and status as a very talented actress.To do a feat like that as an actor you need an uncommon role to play and Hanna is that for Saoirse.Hanna like you can read in other reviews is a teenage girl living in isolation with her father in a frozen forest training to become a perfect assassin, in any other director's hands this would have been a standard and full of cliche action flick, the kind of action film where they like to show off the arsenal and big explosions, cool clothings, cool locations and big explosions again, with catchphrases like I'll be back,so all that is what this movie is not.Director Wright makes the actors face the cameras and act a lot letting us appreciate their performances, particularly you can see how good young Saoirse is at it.

Murray finds out Wilson might be his son...they dont know


So, the crew goes on a crazy ass adventure getting into insane situations, one involving them going on a rescue mission to get a captured friend
Like I said its crazy and insane but hey, its Wes Anderson, so what do you expect

Murray is funny as hell, Wilson is right there with him and Willem Dafoe (The Aviator, Spider-man) is a scream who resembles Jacques Castoe in a way


Also starring Anjelica Houston (The Royal Tenenbaums, The Addams Family), Michael Gambon (Harry Potter and The Prisoner Of Azkaban), Bud Cort (Dogma), Jeff Goldblum (Igby Goes Down, The Big Chill) and Cate Blanchett (The Aviator, The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy)

$review_text.: To me it has always been a breech of decorum to review something on Amazon before it has actually been released but to me, "Home Movies" Season 2 is an exception from where I stand
I've seen the second season of Home Movies many more times than I can count.Adult Swim (for those who don't or can't tune in) can be considered the home of "cutting edge" (though cheaply animated), gutsy, adult oriented animated programming

That's what they, and anyone with low enough standards thinks


What the block really consists of is exhaustively rerun cartoons and every half year something new--- which they will rerun until you can spout out any line of any show on demand.These days, I change the channel until it's time for Home Movies

I've seen the other programs worth watching on the block a hundred times squared anyway, and Home Movies has always been the one gem to consistently make me laugh, even though I know every line from every show thanks to Adult Swim's lack of up-to-date programming


I can't explain it.The first season DVD was great, simply because the show is
They could leave the commentaries, Brendon Small's attempts to display his below average musical ability, and the cast's attempts to convince us that they have careers away from Home Movies off the DVD and we'll still have a 5-star boxed set to add to our growing collection.They did us all a favor and switched from Squigglevision to Flash Animation


The colors are brighter, movements more fluid and the lines hold still, thank God

The shows are less improvised and more scripted, and after hearing Loren Bouchard explain how episodes were recorded in the first boxed set: hours and hours of Jon Benjamin and Brendon Small goofing around, improvising dialogue and then editing the choicest stuff into the episode was probably a huge waste of time and money
One can certainly understand scripting the episodes, and letting the actors go from there and it never once changed the overall feel of the show at the core.My favorite episodes of Season Two are "Therapy", "Class Trip" and especially "The Wedding" ("I am Elfor, The Landstander! I stand on land!")


The show has so many great moments that choosing a favorite is harder than it looks.I was happy to read that Melissa Galsky is joining the cast on the commentary track


I missed hearing her cute voice on the first season commentary


It seemed incomplete to have Brendon and Jason on the track, but no Melissa
I am keeping my fingers crossed that they offer more to us than just a goof-off session on the commentary tracks


I hope to learn something about the process, but if I don't I'll still enjoy this.The show stands by itself, and with or without DVD extras this set is worth the price


I imagine they put extras there just so people wouldn't shell out their money and complain about how the dvd had no extras


I personally could care less about dvd extras, though I harbor some hope that Soup 2 Nuts learned from the mistakes of the last boxed set.Many thanks to Soup 2 Nuts for continuing to release Home Movies on DVD, and I hope to see the rest of the show on DVD all the way to the very last episode
I'd hate to have to keep tuning to Adult Swim at 2AM to get my "Home Movies" fix


Their new shows, such as "Tom Goes to the Mayor" and "Robot Chicken" are so painfully un-funny and difficult to sit through (even for 15 minutes) that I end up watch reruns of South Park or Chapelle's show

The new stuff Adult Swim Sunday offers aren't fit for streaming video, let alone a slot on a TV network, but I guess there's no school like the old school.Many thanks for reading my worthless opinion and I hope it helped a little bit.

$REVIEW.: Latest episodes in this continuing saga


 While Season 1 had the best writing of all, and Season 2 accurately depicted World War 1 era issues, this season is focused on intimate issues of marriage, class, and family economics


 Startling family members die off (not our Maggie Smith!) and new careers are sought by the former Chauffeur as well as middle sister Edith


 The Earl loses a fortune on bad stocks, but Matthew devises a way out


 Mary finally gets her wedding and tries valiantly to get pregnant


 Sybil leaves Ireland and wants to have her baby at Downton

 Falsely imprisoned Bates finally gets help to appeal his murder conviction, and new staff are hired downstairs
 Young kitchen maid Daisy, widowed during the war, thinks she might be ready to find love again since her supervisor, Mrs

Patmore, seems willing to add romance to her own busy life as Downton Abbey's Cook

 Matthew's widowed mother might have romantic options as well, while a new character, a wildly romantic 18 year old great niece of the Dowager Countess, makes her first appearance

 As in life, not all characters' adventures lead to happy endings


 Instead of eagerly desiring new episodes for a vividly realized production, this series ends on a note of sober reckoning
 How long must characters wait for equal opportunities?  How can we continue to care deeply about a series which kills off our most beloved characters?  We hope that after waiting a whole year for another season, the writing will improve its outlook for all characters -- instead of continuing to plunge us into grief and doom.

$review_text.: "The Fog" is a fairly typical representative of a John Carpenter movie. It certainly has its moments, yet it leaves the viewer with an unmistakable feeling of "what might have been." In this sense it reminds me a bit of Michael Mann's 1985 version of F. Paul Wilson's "The Keep", another fascinating yet flawed horror movie which I watch over and over again in the vain hopes of discovering that it is actually good.Stripped to the bone, "The Fog" is the story of a small New England fishing town which is about to celebrate its centennial (or bicentennial....or anniversary of some type). On the eve of this occasion the local priest, a drunken sot played by Hal Holbrook, discovers that the town - like all horror movie small towns - has a terrible secret linked to its founding. This discovery coincides with the appearance of a nasty fog off the coast which tends to leave dead people in its wake, and is moving towards the town. Various characters in the town, including a local beer-guzzler (Tom Atkins) a nubile hitch-hiker (Jamie Lee Curtis) a radio deejay (Adrienne Barbeau) and so on, are all isolated by the fog and soon discover what is inside it, and how it is related to the "terrible secret", an old sin for which the modern-day townsfolk mist pay.As you can see, while the idea is not exactly new it is pretty cool, and when I popped "The Fog" into my ancient DVD player recently I did so after a hiatus of many years, with the hope that my earlier judgement on the film was wrong. In this I was disappointed. Like "The Keep", "The Fog" never gets any better; unlike "The Keep" it actually gets worse.On paper this should not have happened. Besides Carpenter, who was coming off well-received efforts like "Assault on Precinct 13" and "Halloween" there is an impressive cast of actors which actually reunites a good bit of the original "Halloween" crew. Besides Carptenter and Jamie Lee Curtis, there is also the girl who played Annie (Michael's first onscreen victim), as well as the guy who played the Sheriff in both H and H-2. Replacing the ubiquitous Donald Pleasance is Hal Halbrook, and the venerable John Houseman makes an appearance in the film's opening as a creepy, storytellin' sea captain. Even Janet Leigh is involved, as the bitchy yet rather likable wife of a Fog victim. Ironically, tis is part of the film's problem, and it has many.First off, there are far too many characters. The film is cluttered with them and for some reason Carpenter disobeyed the standard horror movie order of whittling them down as the film progresses. Most of the victims are throwaways in no way integral to the plot, and nearly everybody introduced at the beginning is still walking around at the end. We needed more killings, not less.Second, the performances. This movie has good actors, but the dialogue is at best inconsistent and at worst embarrassingly stupid. The worst of it is ladeled onto Adrienne Barbeau, who gets to repeat idiocies like, "My son is trapped! Trapped by the fog!" and "Look out, into the darkness....and beware of the fog!" Gag.Third, the villain(s). Carptenter achieved some neatly creepy atmosphere at the beginning of the film, but he never delivers on it: there is no real payoff. This is because he couldn't seem to decide whether it was the fog itself or what was IN the fog was the actual "baddie" of the film. The result is that no one antagonist ever really emerges. "The Fog" might as well be a run o' the mill flood - faceless and impersonal.The movie does have its moments -- the creepy opening, the moments of atmospheric horror at sea, and the excellent cinematography, which is used to particular effect on the creepy fog-dwellers. But in the end these fail to outweigh the movie's many flaws.As of today, I still regard Carptenter as the most wildly inconsistent director out there. On the one hand he gave us P-13, Halloween, Escape from New York, and The Thing, all classics (cult or otherwise). On the other hand he also gave us crap like Prince of Darkness and the unwatchable Ghosts of Mars. In between there are the fun but flawed outings like They Live and In the Mouth of Madness. I would like to say that The Fog falls in this last category, but I really can't. It just isn't very good, and that's the sad fact of it. Bottom line? Beware The Fog.

$review_text.: IS this what most people think of when they think of great movies?No - of course not - BUT this is still a very enjoyable film


The concept is more intriguing than the actual movie - I really think there is a very good movie somewhere inside of this B film

But due to time constraints and a lack of funds we get this - what would we have got with more money, time and couple of better actors?For example - the scene depicted on the poster and the front of this DVD was never shot but showed a lot of interesting potential

But I guess we could say this about many B films, couldn't we?I would rate this 6.75 to 7.25 stars out of 10 stars

I would recommend this for drive-in fans, B-movie fans, Allison Hayes fans (may she RIP) - heck - almost everyone will like at least some of this movie.

$REVIEW.: The songs are out of order, Glenn Close is CLEARLY too old for the role of Nellie Forbush, the direction is uninspired, and Robert Pastorelli fails to take full advantage of comic aspects of the Luther Billis character.But the scenery looks nice."There is Nothing Like A Dame" is cheapened by re-assigning some vocal parts and having the sailors sing to camera.  Singing to camera should be used very sparingly, if at all.  When used too much it reeks of amateurism and lack of proper musical staging.But the scenery looks nice.

I eagerly awaited each and every scene he was in. He was hillarious! Once every few years comes a new actor that just blows you away. Stark Sands, is a prime example of that statement.Enormously talented and an acting style that is simply amazing with his own style! Don't get me wrong, all involved in this movie are wonderful!

$REVIEW.: A loose young woman with lots of bravado and an oily traveling salesman each attempt to take advantage of a mentally challenged Wisconsin local whose mother was recently killed; the kid's former boss intercedes on his behalf, with everyone keeping a watchful eye on the other. Director Allan Mindel and screenwriter Richard Murphy don't appear to know much about the chilly milieu where ice-fishing is the sport of the day, nor do they seem to connect with the guileless young man at the heart of the story. Many of the performances--and every bit of the hopelessly clich&eacute;d dialogue--are equally lousy. Troy Garity has a handsome, welcoming face, but he seems to have been cast solely for his resemblance to a young Dustin Hoffman--and the cadence of his voice is kept too similar to Hoffman's in "Rain Man" for Garity to carve out a convincing portrayal. Veterans Randy Quaid and Bruce Dern give it some vigor, but Alison Folland's opportunistic tramp seems to have wandered in from a "Saturday Night Live" sketch. Watching snow melt would be more engrossing than sitting through the inept "Milwaukee, Minnesota".

$REVIEW.: This movie follows a cast of Asian, Caucasian, Latino, African-American and Persian characters in Los Angeles during a 36 hour period. It's easy to follow the story and characters, and all their stories intertwine. Every character has some stereotypes of other ethnicities, and their own anger and fear makes them even more prejudiced. One Caucasian couple gets victimized by a pair of African-Americans.  The wife then takes out her fear and anger by humiliating the Latino employees in her life. The entire story is like this.  Someone gets victimized, takes that fear and anger and later lashes out verbally at someone else, and it all rolls together.  In another story line, a storeowner buys a gun to protect his store and his wife, whose was previously threatened by someone. Of course, the next time the storeowner gets angry, he takes out his gun to threaten someone the next time he gets angry. Three cars burn in this movie, and there's a lot of swearing.  In several storylines, you see people having to put up with humiliating racist behaviour, because it's safer for them if they don't complain about it.  I wasn't familiar with some of the references, like Shanique being an African-American name, or calling someone "amigo" because they were Latino, or African-Americans being expected to speak differently from Caucasian characters when they're on tv.The story was very good, and several aspects shocked me - likely because I am from Canada, and have never been to LA.  First, there's a lot of guns and fear. There's this palpable fear of being victimized by someone with a gun. The fearful victim then gets angry at everything and either a) buys his/her own gun to fight back, or b) yells at someone else in anger, usually making racist remarks and further traumatizing someone else. Second, I was shocked by the number of corrupt cops in the story. Is this what they mean when they say a police force is known for corruption? It's hard to imagine, it was shocking.  Third, the power of the HMO was a shock. That a man couldn't see another doctor for a second opinion because the HMO didn't cover it, was a surprise to me, as I am unfamiliar with HMOs. The best part of the movie, I thought was the ending, because almost everyone has a kind of redemption, where they realize how wrong they were to stereotype or take out their anger on anyone else.What I learnt from this movie was that a lot of problems can be prevented by speaking politely and keeping an open mind.  In other words, don't take out your anger at a complete stranger and make racist remarks.  Every interaction with a stranger is a new one, so don't let your personal baggage colour your perception.  The movie was well done, interesting, had good timing and was thought-provoking.

$review_text.: Although it has been said a thousand times in "War of the World's" promotional blitz, it is worth saying again that this ain't your nice Spielberg.  This is "Jaws," "Jurassic Park" Spielberg where he hammers the audience with one white-kunckled, heart-racing jolt after another, racheting up tension to an unbearable level.  Even John Williams chilling score echoes strains from a certain shark flick, sending pulses racing even faster.  Spielberg wastes little time, offering up only a brief exposition to introduce Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise), a lazy, almost inept father looking after his kids (Dakota Fanning and Justin Chatwin) for the weekend while his ex (Miranda Otto) heads off to Boston to be with her parents for the weekend.  All seems normal: Ray cannot connect with his kids and his son take the car out for a joyride.  But all that changes when a strange lightning storm awaken lethal and gargantuan tripods from the Earth.  Before anyones guesses what is going on, the tripods unleash deadly heat rays that incinerate anyone they come in contact with.  The image of Ray covered in the ash of the deceased is a haunting visage of nightmares, and a ghoulish nod to 9/11.  Ray and his kids flee for their lives, trying to go anywhere where they might seek refuge from the ruthless invaders, only to find they roam the countryside, feeding a grisly appetite for live humans.With all the hoopla surrounding Tom Cruise lately, it would seem impossible to look at him on-screen without thinking of the egotistical, self-righteous actor who claimed to be an expert on the complexities of the human brain and the real alien presence among us.  But Cruise does pull off a memorable performance as the deadbeat Ray, perhaps because Ray's boyish attitude toward life mirrors that of Cruise.  Either way, Cruise does get inside Ray in surprising ways, creating a handful of heart-breaking scenes with new-comer Chatwin and the talented-beyond-her-years Fanning.  In the midst of extra-terrestrial mayhem and desparate humans (none moreso than Tim Robbins as a crazy recluse), they provide an emotional core to the film.But above all, this is Spielberg's film, and once he kicks into high gear, he rarely slows down.  And although he recieves immeasurable aid from expert cinematographer Janunz Kaminski and ace editor Michael Kahn, one scene after another are testaments to his incomperable skill for maintaining fast paced thrills and delivering deliberate terrors.  And one sequence after another are testaments to the amazing digital prowess of ILM, who deliver absolutely astounding special effects.  From the methodical carnage of the tripods to the snake-like movements of the aliens and their suveillance technology, the ILM team pull out many a pixelated miracle in bringing the marauding attackers to life.The film overall would prove the perfect summer flick, if only Spielberg and writer David Koepp had not erred in the ending.  Even if the demise of the aliens mirrors H.G. Wells' original text, the finale comes too abrubtly and too sunnily.  The sugary melodramatics of Ray and his family and the all too perfect mass death of the aliens jars with the entire film beforehand, which was as nightmarish and heart-pounding as any movie in recent memory.  Nonetheless, you will be hard pressed to find an equal this summer to the kind of expert thrills and jolts provided so exuberantly by Spielberg and his gifted cast and crew.  Heres' hoping that we are truly alone in the universe.

$REVIEW.: "Veronica Guerin" (2003), a biographical/true crime/drama/thriller, is set in recent times in Dublin, Ireland, tells an Irish story, has a largely Irish cast, but appears to have been largely American-made.  And that's only one of the puzzling things about this movie.  Story and screenplay are credited to Carol Doyle; direction is by Joel Schumacher; Jerry Bruckheimer, with his typical largesse - the brightest colors, and the most possible action-- gets the production credit.  The film received one Golden Globes nomination.The movie plays like a hagiography of its title character, (Cate Blanchett), a crusading journalist, determined to wipe out the Dublin drug trade. Brenda Fricker plays her worried mother, Bernie Guerin.  For the other side, Gerald McSorley gives us a chilling portrait of gangster boss John Gilligan; Ciaran Hinds, a seedy street level thug, John Traynor.  (From the tough, hard-edged performances given us by these gentlemen, it seems possible that a quiet class antagonism underlies some of the violence in the picture.)  Further, Colin Farrell turns up in a brief cameo as a tattooed young man, without billing, who knows why.Blanchett, remarkable cheekbones and all, gives us an intense, highly watchable performance as Guerin.  Is she too pretty for the character?  Too delicately made?  How true is the movie to life?  That's puzzling, too.  The film seems to portray its leading character as reckless to a foolhardy degree.  She's a daughter, a sister, a wife, and the mother of a young child, yet she ignores threats on her life, and the child's, an actual beating, and a gun-shot wound.  (The film opens with her assassination; so I don't think I can be spoiling it for anyone by discussing it.)  We have recently developed the concept of "suicide by cop;" that is, a person has had enough of it all but hasn't the courage to pull the trigger and end it.  So he creates a situation in which a cop will have to do it.  Seemed to me Guerin was almost going for "suicide by gangster," creating confrontations with people she knew to be violent.Her assassination does lead to hearings held, laws changed, ill-gotten gains confiscated, perhaps a dozen men imprisoned, and a blip in the drug trade.  For that, she paid a high price, as did her family.  On a quite recent trip to Ireland, several people mentioned, without prompting, that the drug problem among the youth of the country is still severe.  Observers might think that this drug use is caused by widespread social problems the country has yet to solve, and that, where there's a market, ways will be found to supply it.

$REVIEW.: Rarely does one find a film whose quality is of such a grand scale as to be difficult to quantify
 We finmd such a film in Superman - The Movie.Director Richard Donner literally and figuratively had the word  Verisimilitude plastered all over the various locales used in shooting the  film, to hammer home the point that the film required genuine  verisimilitude
 The crew got the hint, and delivered a film that remains  powerful.The opening is a clever mix of inauspiciousness and epic; a  child reads the opening pages of the original 1938 Action Comics issue that  launched The Man Of Steel; we then fly over The Daily Planet building circa  1938, reach space, and are then confronted with the awe-inspiring sliding  names and words that make up the film's opening credits


 The credit  sequence is worth discussing because it alone is worth the price of the  film, from John Williams' tremendous Superman theme (here presented with  increased reverb) to the clever mixture of lights and solar waves as the  audience is transported through space.Finally the film begins in earnest  on the planet Krypton, a world populated by humans whose molecular  structure has been changed due to the radiation of the planet's crimson  central star

 Krypton is doomed because its sun is pulling it out of orbit  onto a collision course, but the ruling quorom pay no heed to the warnings  of its greatest scientist, Jor-El (people have put the rap on Marlon  Brando's performances over the years, but here he shines)


 Joe-El  nonetheless builds a starship so that his infant son, Kal-El, can be  transported to Earth, a planet orbiting a yellow sun whose radiation will  allow his molecular density to make him strong, fast, and all but  invulnerable.The destruction of Krypton and Kal-El's journey to Earth  are harrowingly presented, and culminate in the crash-landing of the  starship onto a field near the Kansas village of Smallville
 The impact  blows a tire on the truck of local farmers Martha and Jonathan Kent  (Phyllis Thaxter and Glenn Ford), and as they stop to repair it, they see  the meteor bearing the small child.And so it goes, until some eighteen  years later
 The boy, Clark Kent (played by Jeff East in the Smallville  sequence with Christopher Reeve's voice dubbed in), finds the spire and is compelled to travel to the North Pole (this following a tearful goodbye to his Earth mother),  where the spire creates a huge crystaline fortress

 Within this Fortress  Of Solitude, the spirit of Jor-El summons his son through the boundaries of  space, where he evolves into an adult being, bearing the S-shaped crest of The House Of El amid the now-familiar blue and red costume and  cape.Christopher Reeve now takes over, and the film nicely relaxes from  the love and pain that permeate its first third
 Clark Kent is played a  bit too broadly, coming off more as a doofus than a believable person - this is due to Reeve's interpretation of Kent as in the mold of Cary Grant's comedic persona

 But  when Kent changes to his super-powered alter ego, Reeve shines, presenting  him as authoritative, but not excessively so


 He pulls off a series of  acts, saving lives and stopping crimes, that excite the world and lead him  to be dubbed Superman.In comes criminal lord Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman)
 Mysteriously deducing Superman's weakness from a National Geographic photo  of a meteorite, Luthor traps Superman to prevent him from pulling off  "the greatest real estate swindle of all time" via sabotaged  nuclear missiles intended to detonate the San Andreas Fault and set off an  earthquake that will collapse the West Coast into the Pacific Ocean.Superman's battle to stop the missiles and stop the ensuing quake  involve some of the best SFX ever put to screen, between the tremendously  effective flying sequences (this is the only Superman film to speed up  backgrounds to present the look and feel of flying at light speed), the  amazing sequence where Superman flies UNDER the California coast to move  the enormous landmass back into place, saving a teetering bus, saving a  train running headlong to a collapsed spur, and trying to stop a flood from  the collapse of Hoover Dam.Not only will you believe a man can fly,  you'll wish all of it could happen in real life

 Such is the enduring  power of Superman.

$REVIEW.: A film by Jim DrakeThe misfit police officers are back at it again.  This time the officers are being asked to help with the new "Citizens on Patrol" program.  This program allows regular citizens to help clean up the streets of the city and just like the first "Police Academy" movie, the new program attracts an assorted band of misfits which is characterized by a little old grandma (Billie Bird) who, like Tackleberry (David Graf) is obsessed with guns and weaponry.  Hilarity is supposed to ensue as these new C.O.P.s (clever, huh?) try to bust real criminals and make citizens arrest while they bungle their way into real police work.Hilarity does not really ensue, though it is better than "Police Academy 5: Project Miami Beach", but then the series is getting progressively worse.  The style of comedy is much the same as the other "Police Academy" movies.  It is slapstick, silly, bungling humor, and it works to an extent the first time you see the movie.  It works especially well if the viewer is younger, around 10 years old or so.  Any truly offensive scenes have been scrubbed out of this series (though the first movie was rated "R").This fourth movie is notable for being the last of the "Police Academy" movies to feature Steve Guttenberg as Officer Carey Mahoney.  Note the drop in quality when Guttenberg leaves only to replaced by the similar character Nick Lassard in P.A. 5.  This movie also has a younger Sharon Stone and David Spade is supporting roles and a cameo appearance by a very young Tony Hawk.  None of the "Police Academy" movies are all that good, except perhaps the first one, but by the time the fourth movie rolled around it was clearly time to stop.  That's my recommendation: stop.  If you have seen the first three, you have seen all the good parts and you are now just washing a less funny rehash of the earlier movies.  It is nice to see Captain Harris (G.W. Bailey) back, but let's just let this series rest now.-Joe Sherry

$review_text.: Wish I would have paid more attention to the reviews before I wasted my money.  During the entire film I felt like I was having a bad dream.  The character played by Joaquin Phoenix was so repulsive I had to look away at times during the film.  I came close to throwing up at the final scene with Phoenix in bed with a woman when, once again, there was nudity for no apparent reason,  And believe me -- in this case -- you don't want to see it.  A really forgettable film...I just wish I could.

$REVIEW.: I guess almost everybody has seen the movie, so I'll stick to the DVD review only.A beatifully packed DVD. When I opened the DVD pack, for a minute I did nothing but admire the DVD cover.The second DVD is full of stuff for kids. As for me, it was a little below expectation. I expected stuff like interview with JK Rowlings, making of the movie, etc. But there is nothing much for the grown-ups. The only thing I found interesting were the deleted scenes. But they are not easily accesible. You have put in your harry knowlege to reach the deleted scenes.To summarize, it is definately a great(must) buy for kids. But otherwise buy the DVD for the movie (and offcourse deleted scenes) but do not expect too much special stuff.

$review_text.: This film deals with a young girl's realization that she is gay.I strongly feel it is a film that everybody should watch, especially parents of gay children and gay and straight teenagers. Important issues are dealt with in a tasteful, sensitive manner. It is educational and eye-opening without being too preachy or threatening to straight audiences.We see the main character, Jane, deal with her first lesbian relationship and the ensuing heartbreak once the relationship ends. We see how Jane learns to deal with the homophobia from her classmates and friends. Most importantly, we see how Jane's family reacts and deals with her homosexuality.Where I feel the realism breaks down a bit is that fact that Jane has two gay role models to help her through difficulties: her mother's gay friend (played by RuPaul), and a sympathetic English teacher who confronts Jane's parents at one point. I don't think most gay teens are so fortunate as Jane. Still, this movie may help to serve as a tool for gay teens to come out to their parents. This movie will also help those parents as well, since they'll see that much of what they're feeling are portrayed by Jane's two parents. This film is recommended by PFLAG and made with their cooperation.

$REVIEW.: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know. I can't help it. I was hooked on Downton Abbey from episode one. I know I got the dumbed down PBS version, with about 4 episodes of material cut out because, after all, we Americans are morons and complexity makes us chew on our toes and commit mayhem in the workplace.  I don't care. It's like that boy all your friends think is an idiot and you know is an idiot, but lord, he's so cute.If you enjoy the genre, stories about the privileged people who lived on their fabulous estates, the relationships between those "upstairs" and those behind the green baize door in that brief golden period before WWI, you have to love Downton Abbey, even with all its flaws.  We get so little that's good (consider the horrible revival of Upstairs/Downstairs), even the merely mediocre can be a delight.The whole story hinges upon whether Lady Mary Crawley will marry Matthew Crawley. The Crawley estate is,you see, entailed to the oldest living male relative, who happens to be cousin Matthew. She is a fiery beauty...arrogant, bright and stubborn. He is a not so attractive middle-class suburban solicitor of the midlands...the equivalent of an insurance salesman from Bismarck, North Dakota in the 'you make my heart beat faster' scheme of things.You do have to send your brain to wait in the hallway if you're gonna watch. Nothing is true to life.  First of all, the family treats  servants with respect and affection.  Yeah, right. Like that happens. When His Lordship's valet gets into big trouble with the law, is he fired faster than you can say "no severance pay?" Nope, Lord Crawley helps the guy marry one of the housemaids, pays for his legal expenses, and testifies in court for the guy.  When cook starts to go blind, do they replace her with another one faster than you can say "you won't be needing a reference in the workhouse." Nope. They send her to private hospital and get her the best medical attention money can buy.  When the butler is discovered to have "A Past," the family finds it a jolly good joke.  All is forgiven. Read any memoir by any servant of any era.  See how often that kinda thing happened.  Or look at your own employers. When was the last time the CEO offered to pay your medical bills, send your kids to college and take care of your legal troubles?Anyway, the Crawley Family has its share of ups and downs.  The romance between Matthew and Lady Mary is so rocky, they both get engaged to others at one point. She to a self-made millionaire newspaper publisher who looks and occasionally acts like Snidely Whiplash.  He to a simpering and sincere but not so pretty young woman. The servants get up to all sorts of hijinks, and upstairs and down, there are pregnancies and miscarriages, romances blossom, murders are committed, housemaids are compromised and impregnated, and chauffeurs and daughters elope until one begins to feel grateful for one's own family, where such things only happen every month or two, not every week. Fortunately, no problem except for the question of Mary and Matthew getting together (and that of the murderous valet) takes more than one episode or so to solve. Everyone usually ends up right as rain. Well, except for Cousin Matthew who really takes a beating.First of all, Mary puts the moves on him, solely to get her hands on the title to the estate. Then she backs off, then she comes back, backs off again, and so on. When war breaks out, our Matthew goes off to fight in the trenches, where he has more bad luck than any one man should.  First he goes missing. Then he's dead. Then he's alive again, but engaged to the not-so-hot little blonde.  Then bingo, he's lost again, followed by dead, followed by not dead. But woe unto him, his injury is of a nature that leaves him crippled, confined to a chair and -- dare I say it -- unmannificated. That's right. The Injury That Dare Not Speak Its Name, because they never say it, but from the way Matthew rests his head in his hands and the way that Mary looks at him, we know. Boy, do we know.  And what's worse, the simpering little fiancee swears she'll stick by him anyway.  Oy, this fellow has no luck at all.Anyway, in one of the funniest scenes ever seen on any screen, large or small, Matthew undergoes a miracle.  One minute he's sitting there all wan and unmanned with his fiance. Then she trips and falls. Instinctively, Matthew leaps from the chair to save her and crashes to the floor.  Lying on the carpet, he suddenly looks up heavenward and cries: "I feel a Tingle."  Gracious!  Dare we hope it is not just A tingle, but The tingle?  Within moments, His Lordship rounds up the family and the staff, crying "Here, everyone, you must see this!"  The entire audience (I know I was) is on the edge of their seats waiting to see whatever they are about to reveal.  Turns out, Matthew just gets up out of the wheelchair and walks, but we are given to believe that the miracle cure was sufficient to, you know, fix stuff, because shortly afterwards he is seen dancing with Mary and flirting his fool head off, something an unmannificated man would not do.  Not an English one, anyway.Well, given that he still has feelings for Mary who now has feelings for him, and given that everyone can now feel their feelings, and are feeling quite frisky as a result, Matthew would be in quite the pickle, all able bodied but still lumbered with Miss Got No Rocks. Fortunately we get yet another unexpected visitor: Influenza and out flies the Fiancee, another victim of the epidemic.Yeah, I know it sounds silly. And when you look too closely, there is no reason to love Downton Abbey. It's unrealistic, the people upstairs are inane, the servants are the happiest lot of domestic workers on the planet.  We have a cook who is not a shrew and who mentors the scullery maid instead of thwacking her with the spatula.  The housekeeper is a jewel of selflessness who gives up marriage and a life of her own to thrill vicariously to the events Upstairs.  The butler adores the family to the point where, even when he is sick to the point of death, he insists on serving the port.  This is a guy who dreams of crawling over broken glass to fetch the morning paper for his Lordship. Even the murdering valet smiles in the face of adversity to the point where you want to kick him in his bad leg.  The only bad characters are a truly psychotic but oddly loyal lady's maid and a devious but inept footman.  But except for one really, really bad thing done by the maid, they don't do much beyond plotting.So why love it?  Well, for one thing, Maggie Smith.  She is so good as the Dowager Lady Crawley, and her dialogue is so witty, it belongs in a different mini-series.  It's worth the effort of watching just for her moments.  And it's fun. No, there is nothing to be gleaned here, you won't get a history lesson...although the attention paid to the period costumes is excellent and of itself another good reason for watching. (One wonderfully realistic note: the characters repeat their costumes. The 3 sisters have their 'good dresses' that they wear on important occasions, and everyday outfits are repeated frequently.)  But it's true, Downton Abbey doesn't give us anything close to real-life situations. But who needs real life. Don't we get enough of that in real life?  Suspend your disbelief, pour some sherry (okay, a lot of sherry--break out that Bucket o' Sherry you were saving for an emergency) and just enjoy.  There, that's not so hard, is it.(Just like that cute but brainless boy, there is a time and a place for everything. Next week you can dig out "Life in the English Country House: A Social and Architectural History" by Mark Girouard...or even better, "Wait for Me!: Memoirs by Deborah Vivien Freeman-Mitford Cavendish Duchess of Devonshire."  Almost as much fun and she doesn't make up nearly as much stuff as the writers of Downton Abbey.)

$review_text.: Wow, what a disappointing comedy.  Ice Cube pretending to be tough.  Kevin Hart pretending to be soft.  Using bland humor and cutesy buddy comedy twists and hoping we giggle like schoolgirls.The plot is easy to figure out, with a lot of attempts at being funny that totally fail.  If you laugh at all, it is because of Kevin Hart.  And the laughs don't come that often.  He is underused, which stinks.  Then you have Leguizamo who is in the film as a manikin, basically.  He is woefully underused as well.There is an entertaining action sequence in the end, but everything up until then is just bland.  You can see there were quite a few scenes where Hart could have shined, but the film makers chose to accept the boring cut and move on.  Lazy production.NEVER BUY THIS.  You might want to finish it, but you will never watch it twice.  You are much better off renting Kevin Hart's stand-up specials.  If you want to see Ice Cube in a much tougher role, rent Ghosts of Mars.  He co-stars with Jason Statham before he was famous.

$REVIEW.: It strikes me that as much as I hate Hollywood remaking its past, the exercise is nevertheless fruitful in getting studios to reissue the original films on DVD and for that I am grateful. In a sort of commemorative celebration of the 2004 remake that has only just hit theaters this week MGM/UA has re-released a special edition of this perversely chilling and suspenseful 1962 thriller. At once a timely and timeless tale of espionage and intrigue, "The Manchurian Candidate" was withheld from distribution for almost a quarter century after President Kennedy's assassination - presumably because its parallels between truth and fiction were just too upsetting for star, Frank Sinatra to get over. Yet despite its disappearance from the spotlight, the film has lost none of its dark potency. The plot is an eerie foreshadowing time capsule of sorts. Former infantryman Bennet Marco (Frank Sinatra) is tormented by a perpetual nightmare in which he and his platoon have been brainwashed in Korea. Through a series of conversations with other former fellow POWs, Marco becomes increasingly suspicious of his subconscious as he agonizes ever closer to uncovering the horrific truth. The indecipherable snippets focus on Bennett's decorated war hero, Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey). Like most of Harvey's subsequent roles, he plays a generally cool, aloof loner - this time with a diabolically nattering, hen-pecker of a mother (Angela Lansbury) in tow.  She's a manipulative queen bee, exporting the limited political prowess of her Senator husband, John Iselin (James Gregory) and re-channeling it into something reminiscent of the whole ungodly mess surrounding the McCarthy era. But Shaw is a "sleeper", a brainwashed ticking time bomb set to explode with the detonation of a series of precipitating code words. This is a terrific thriller, one that has suspense, realistic characters, and the kind of riddle within an enigma plot that should both entertain and edify you all at the same time. Director, John Frankenheimer presents this macabre bit of classic film making with all of his usual brilliance and flair for visually stunning and evocative images.The MGM/UA Special Edition DVD delivers very few extras. The best reason for this reissue is a new 5.1 stereo mix and its anamorphic widescreen transfer - both absent from the previously issued DVD. This current incarnation of "The Manchurian Candidate" exhibits a very smooth, surprisingly detailed B&W; transfer. The gray scale is generally nicely balanced, though night time photography continues to suffer from a generally soft characteristic and very weak black and contrast levels. Nevertheless, film grain is minimal and fine details are exceptionally realized. Occasionally a hint of edge enhancement crops up, as well as some shimmering of fine details, but these are very rare and absolutely DO NOT distract from one's visual enjoyment. The audio has been remixed and, although sounding strident in some cases, exhibits a vintage quality with good separation and no background hiss. Director John Frankenheimer provides an incredibly detailed and compelling commentary. There's also a very short 1988 snippet from a cast reunion special. Limited reminiscences from Angela Lansbury and another all too short featurette, hosted by Frankenheimer, round out the extras.

$REVIEW.: The reason I give "Dinner Rush"  only 4 stars is that this is not a movie that &quot;goes home with you&quot; and that you keep thinking about or feel like it made you "grow" ; another problem might be the fact that I did keep wondering what happened next? I mean, did the police accept the coincidence of all relevant people being at the restaurant on the same particular night? But getting into this would be letting out too much


These however are my only negative comments.Other then that, we are talking about a great movie involving all segments of great satisfaction - good food, suspense, some mafia hints, a love story and father- son relations


In fact father and two sons relations as I see Duncan as a second "son" to Mr


Cropa
I would like to add that the family issues involving father son, dead mother and so on are not chewed up or dragged along the movie
They get their right share in all the rest of the action and this is what is so nice about this movie
We only get a hint of the fact that Udo is not really happy that Mr
Cropa eats only the food Duncan cooks but not a lot more then that and we get a sense that all in all Duncan is the only person Udo really trusts and respects in the kitchen and the one he calls in time "of need" (a need to impress the critic) and the one he bothers to say "thank you" to.All characters are beautifully played and Danny Aiello as Louis Cropa gives the movie the really human touch


He is so convincing and such a real character, a live human being
The movie ends with some hope in his regard - a hope for a romance and a beginning of a new life for Mr


Cropa


Duncan is truly loveable and the viewer is happy that Nicole thinks so too


I actually enjoyed the staff characters more then those of the snobbish guests
I loved the Latin kitchen workers and I loved Marty the artist-waitress

So more real then the snobbish food critic or the gallery owner..

(but that's another issue altogether) I even liked the policeman's wife - a rather small, somewhat irritating character but so real and so well played (wanting one work-free night with her husband)

However I think that Udo, who is not very likable at the beginning of the movie (he more or less makes his entrance by firing a kitchen worker whose knife is not sharp enough) is a person that changes throughout the movie

Its not really change but more of the different faces of him that you get to see and you end the picture thinking - "yes..

he does deserve the restaurant..."



Also the food - of all kinds, sausage and peppers and the amazing lobster

I am willing to eat them all and truly enjoyed to see people enjoying good food whether it is new or old kitchen alike.

$REVIEW.: Filmmaker Frank Darabont has a real affinity for Stephen King's stories having previously adapted two of the author's non-horror tales (The Shawshank Redemption (Two-Disc Special Edition)andThe Green Mile (Two-Disc Special Edition)) and with his latest film he tackles another King story, The Mist, which comes fromSkeleton Crew (Signet)collection of short stories


Darabont's film thankfully flies in the face of the two prevailing trends of gruesome torture porn horror films and lame J-horror remakes to deliver old school scares for a truly satisfying horror film.Darabont does an excellent job establishing the characters, the dilemma they all face, and then pitting them against each other
Some critics had problems with the shrill, Bible-thumping character of Mrs


Carmody as being an easy caricature; however, by the end of the film, all of the things she has said come true

As anyone who has read any of Stephen King's fiction or seen one of his adaptations knows, a recurring motif is how the internal squabbling of a large group of people is as much of a threat as the horror that threatens them

King shows how fragile the trappings of society are and how it only takes one thing to trigger its collapse.What is so refreshing about The Mist is how flawed the characters are as represented by David, a movie poster artist and the film's hero

He gets scared and makes mistakes but rises to the occasion when needed


Is he any less of a hero for doing what he does in the film? Darabont raises some fascinating questions about the notion of heroics and this is nicely realized by Thomas Jane's wonderfully layered performance
The filmmaker has created a clever, tension-filled apocalyptic monster movie that has the balls to go out on such a daring sucker-punch of an ending that really ticked off some fans of the original novella

Darabont's film remains true to the spirit and vibe of King's story despite the radical reworking of the ending.The first disc features an audio commentary by writer/director Frank Darabont


He spends the bulk of the track pointing out how he cut costs on this modestly budgeted film and gives credit to the crew members who helped him make it, in particular, the effects people


Darabont goes into the nuts and bolts of filmmaking but the highlight is his explanation/justification of the film's controversial ending


As always, he delivers thoughtful observations and imparts loads of information.Also included are eight deleted scenes with optional commentary by Darabont


One scene provides an interesting bit of insight into Brent's character


There is more of David and Ollie trying to convince the others early on about the outside threat

Also included is more of Mrs


Carmody's religious ramblings."Drew Struzan: An Appreciation of an Artist" is a profile of this prolific movie poster artist

He has done some of the most memorable posters of all time, including ones for the Star Wars films, E.T

(1982), Blade Runner (1982), and the Indiana Jones films to name but a few
Darabont points out that the introduction of David working in his studio in the film is a tribute to Struzan.There are three Webisodes hosted by Darabont that provide a behind-the-scenes look at three scenes in the film and show what it looks like on the set juxtaposed with final product
We get to see how they did various practical effects in these scenes.Also included are three trailers.The second disc features a black and white version of the film that Darabont claims, in his introduction to it, is his preferred version because it was intended as an homage to classic horror films of the mid-1960s."When Darkness Came: The Making of The Mist" takes a look at the origins of the film

Stephen King sings Darabont's praises and talks about how he trusted the filmmaker with the material

There is plenty of on the set footage where we see the cast and crew in action
None of the major studios wanted to do it but Bob Weinstein gave it the greenlight so long as Darabont agreed to do it cheaply and in very little time

This is an excellent look at how this film came together."Taming the Beast: Shooting Scene 35" takes a look at the scene where the mutant bugs and birds invade the supermarket

It's the most action-packed scene in the film and was a challenge to shoot and coordinate because it involved a tricky combination practical and digital effects, lots of extras, and stunts."Monsters Among Us: A Look at the Creature FX" examines the designs for the various creatures in the film
He employed effects legend Greg Nicotero and illustrator extraordinaire Bernie Wrightson to design them and make them exotic-looking yet realistic enough so it seemed like they could really exist
It was a mix of CGI and practical mechanical creatures and puppetry.Finally, there is "The Horror of It All: The Visual FX of The Mist" which takes a look at Caf&eacute; FX's work on the film's visual effects

Their main guy used to do prosthetic effects and so he had an idea of what would be practical and what would be CGI


His company had very little time and we see the various stages of the effects
We also see how various effects shots in the film were achieved.

$review_text.: It's been quite a while since there was any film made with the words "Return of the Living Dead" in the title, and hearing those words brings up some great memories.  The 1985 comedy/horror classic, it's lesser but even more comedy-laden sequel, and the third film which traded in the laughs for all out shocks and gore.  All three films were good in varying degrees, which is why the idea that a made for the Sci-Fi Channel sequel will surely leave you thinking that the results of this will be anything less than comprehensible.  Filmed in Romania, Peter Coyote is the only recognizable face as a mad scientist whose teenage nephew and his friends get mixed up with the local evil company; which leads to zombies running amok.  Make no mistake that Return of the Living Dead 4 is beyond bad with a few good moments (when two friends come across a former female friend turned zombie, the one yells at the other one to shoot her, as the other responds "but I lost my virginity to her!") but what else did you expect?  And if you think this is bad, just see the sequel (yes you read that right) entitled Return of the Living Dead 5: Rave to the Grave.

I have to say this is the best supernatural thriller made from Thailand, and I have seen a fair share of them(Nang nak, the sisters, mae nak, art of the devil series).The film focuses on Tun and his girlfriend Jane. Tun, a photographer reunites with his old friends. On the way home, they accidentally hit a girl with their car and from then on, Tun sees ghostly apparitions whenever he takes pictures or whenever he tries to develop them.  Ok, I am not spoiling anything, the story is more complex than it sounds. Tun and his friends have a past that catches up to them, with Jane caught in the middle. As usual, there is a vengeful spirit going around killing people. "Shutter" refers to his camera and what it represents. "Sometimes the dead cannot let go of their loved ones.." I'm stopping here, I don't want to give out anymore.The plot is not that complex, but believe me when I say, the film is well-made. It does a great job of putting things together, each shocking scene is linked to the past and the present. I didn't see any scene wasted and it has that very atmospheric, creepy feel to it.  Also, there is a scene in the movie that Tun and Jane looked at ACTUAL photos of ghostly apparitions in a polaroid.Honestly, this film has some great scenes that can make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end the very first time you watch it and the "shock ending" has the greatest twist of any horror flick I've seen! I've seen a lot of horror films, only THE EXORCIST and THE OMEN ever scared/creeped me out, and SHUTTER came very close. My female friends were scared out of their wits when they saw it at my place.Since I haven't seen the TARTAN release and I only own the region-3 DTS-ES rlease from PanMedia (Hong Kong)but Tartan usually uses the same transfers from either the HONG KONG or KOREAN versions. The video is sufficient, with some dark and bright contrast. It is not free of grain but it does add to the atmospheric feel. the DTS soundtrack is great though, very crisp and loud. The english subtitles are excellent, the Thai language track is the only way to watch as it was meant to be seen.A DEFINITE must-see if you are a fan of ASIAN HORROR or horror films in general. It rivals RINGU, ONE MISSED CALL and the original JU-ON 1 and 2.FOUR AND 1/2 STARS!!

$REVIEW.: This movie was funny and clever and gripping from its opening moments.Very well cast and directed, with a cameo towards the end that by itself is worth the price of rental.I was pleasantly surprised,to say the least

 Who knew there could be yet another fresh take on this overdone genre?  A thrill ride from start to finish

Double tap!And remember: some rules are made to be broken.

The stories being true make them more gripping and make you think about the choices you make and living right. Believing in god, a higher power, another existance for those that doubt......Love, Love,.Loved this movie and will for sure be getting for my collection. I was never fond of dolls as a little girl, they still give me the creeps!!!!  Plus it makes you think about what you get at yard sales and thrift stores when you could be bringing something that should be locked up, into your home.

$review_text.: I chose both J & A in my summary because one without the other would not have succeeded in the deep and profound lives they lived. First of all a sober assessment of this film should be put aside until one has read David McCullough's fantastic historical account of J.A. The reader is entertained by a master storyteller, who first caught my ear in the ever great Ken Burns series "The Civil War", where he was used as narrator and historian. Once you have read this book then the many facts that you face when watching the film will make all the more sense.Why is J.A. such a great series? The producers and director took great pains to reproduce the look and feel, the authenticity of the times. (my one and only criticism of this and just about every such series is that costumes, especially of the soldiers all look like they were just freshly pressed and taken from the closet. Soldiers of the day had no such luxury and probably looked pretty shabby, notwithstanding the bright colours. But I quibble....) The overall view is the impression that we are looking at the times as they really were. What I noted in particular was the extreme hazards of a winter time boat crossing of the Atlantic !!!! Good heavens, I can think of few things at that time or our own that were more perilous and as we watch poor J.A. wretchedly sick as the boat crashes upon the waves....we tremble at their fate. Never mind that they had to fight a pitched battle against a British ship....and could have been sunk themselves.John Adams was a complex man but a very good and moral one. Bull headed when he dug in his heels, opinionated, erudite, hard working, a devoted and loving father and husband. All of his life's energies he channelled through the filter that was his beloved wife, Abigail. John trusted no other human as much as his Abigail. They say that they had one of the great love and literary affairs of the century. If the volume of correspondence and the expressions therein are adequate testimony, then we witness a true love. John was both a farmer, scholar and lawyer, something not seen much in our time. He was also guided by a simple but iron willed principle that all men must be governed by laws and that society that abandons them opens itself up to the rule of the mob. Early in his life he is tested as he is given the thankless task of defending British soldiers who stood accused of killing several colonists. His uneasy but fierce and successful defence of the soldiers gives us an idea of the depth of this man. He was to be tested over and over again as he was torn away from wife and children to tend to national duties as they rapidly evolved. There was not a single time that he did not gain his wife's blessings to his paths, no matter the pain it caused her.The series quite accurately tells their story. From the incredibly difficult days where he was away in Philadelphia helping hammer out the declaration of independence while sickness and the British forces gave his wife and children many sleepless nights to the even more wrenching times when John was alone in Europe trying with great vexation to motivate French and Dutch bankers and royalty to support the erupting American revolution. The series shows the physical depredations he lived through and the mentally trying decision to send his young son John Quincy off to St. Petersburg as a diplomatic assistant.The ensemble cast is superb from top to bottom. Much detail is given to making the actors appear as close to the historical characters. While they had no photography back then they certainly had plenty of portrait painters and we know pretty much what they looked like. David Morse's depiction of Washington was almost inch for inch what he would have looked like, the actor being as tall as Washington was. As well it is known that Washington's teeth had been removed or came out and that he wore ivory dentures. Look at all the stuffing in Morse's mouth and the attempt to reproduce the generals face is all there.While there is so much tragedy in the Adams family, with the loss of a daughter to cancer and a son to alcoholism, the most shattering moment comes when John watches his wife slip away. Such very great people you cannot find much in the historical record. I still must say that I find Thomas Jefferson one of the most vile of the founding fathers. A prosperous, brilliant, urbane, conniving, calculating and charming man who simply could not see his pleasures and wealth compromised by ever giving up his slaves, of which it now appears that he fathered a number of children; I find him personally disgusting. Give me John Adams and the manner in which he was a father, a husband, a Vice and President of the United States. When all is said and done, this is one of those very great series that should be mandatory in every American school system.The chemistry between Laura Linney and Paul Giamatti is composed of a wealth of excellent dialogue, quotes from their huge output of letters to each other and by the unbreakable bonds of love. Clearly these actors felt a sympathy for these founders and were able to channel their spirit with such clarity. Tom Wilkinson's depiction of Dr. Benjamin Franklin is wonderful to behold. Watch for the hilarious chess game played in the bathtub. As I am watching the series all over again it motivates me to re-read McCullough's book. Both are treasures you should own and learn from.

$review_text.: Such false advertising!  All I have to say is that this is a pretentious, esoteric piece of crap trying to be a "European" film.  I understand it may be hard for actors Josh Hartnett and Rose Byrne's age to find quality work, but wow.Pretty much, nothing happens in this film.  The flashbacks and left-out details make it seem like much more is going on than it actually is.  Our sympathetic villain(s?) really aren't that threatening as they try to break up a relationship the audience really isn't invested in in the first place.  Don't think this is Fatal Attraction or even Sea of Love.  These actors have better performances in other movies, so go buy those instead.

It is simply spectacular .The talent, the voice, the grace of Celine and the dancers, musicians; everybody involved in this project is beyond imagination. A show created by Dragone with all the implications that he's huge name has makes this DVD a must have. If you are not a Celine's fan after this you will become one. I never had the opportunity of seen the show live, but now I have the DVD and the opportunity of been in one of the concerts of her next world tour and I'm not going to miss it....

$review_text.: Carved is a great ghost story that is extremely dark and extremely creepy at times. It deals with things that American film won't touch, namely, the killing of children with a large pair of scissors. Now if that isn't dark I don't know what is. The film can be quite shocking at times and I don't understand why some of the other reviewers said the pacing was too slow. The movie doesn't go at a breakneck speed but at the same time the film doesn't take it's time with introducing the villain. Overall, a great horror film that will appeal to most people even if they aren't interested in Asian horror. On a side note, read this account from wikipedia of the actual legend,"The legend is said to originate with a young woman who lived hundreds of years ago (some versions of the legend state the Heian period) and was either the wife or concubine of a samurai. She is said to have been very beautiful but also very vain, and possibly cheating on her husband. The samurai, extremely jealous and feeling cuckolded, attacked her and slit her mouth from ear to ear, screaming "Who will think you're beautiful now?"The urban myth picks up from this point, stating that a woman roams around at night (especially during foggy evenings), with her face covered by a surgical mask, which would not be especially unusual, as people in Japan often wore masks in order to protect themselves from the flu. When she encounters someone (primarily children or college students), she will shyly ask, "Am I beautiful?" ("Watashi kirei?"). If the person answers yes, she will take off her mask and say, "Am I beautiful now?" ("Kore demo?"). At this point, if the victim answers "No," she will slay them or cut their mouths to resemble hers (in many versions, her weapon is a pair of scissors). If the victim tells her she is pretty a second time, she follows the victim home and slays them at the doorway to their residence, due to the fact that "kirei" ('''), Japanese for 'pretty,' is a near homophone of "kire" (''), the imperative form of "to cut". In other versions of the myth if you reply yes after she removes the mask she will give you a large blood soaked ruby and walk away. Another version says that if you reply yes, she will take her scissors and cut your mouth from ear to ear, making you resemble her. On most versions of the myth she is impossible to escape, as she can either appear in front of you no matter which way you turn or can move at superhuman speeds and catch you.&lt;Yokai Attack, Kodansha Publishing>"Creepy much?
$SUMMARY.: Make sure you don't scream or shudder when you see her face...

$REVIEW.: Monster-a-Go-Go! (Bill Rebane, 1965)Bill Rebane (The Giant Spider Invasion), who would go on to be generally considered one of the worst directors of all time, first inflicted his vision of celluloid idiocy on the American public with Monster-a-Go-Go!, a sort of cross between fifties B monster movies and Reefer Madness!. (Weirdly, it bears more than a little resemblance to the later film The Incredible Melting Man. I have always wondered what drugs the makers of that movie were on; now I wonder how many times they watched Monster-a-Go-Go! and what drugs they were under the influence of while watching it.) Filmed by Rebane in 1961 and abandoned when he had trouble finding financing, Monster-a-Go-Go! Was given a new lease on life in 1965, when Herschell Gordon Lewis bought the footage from Rebane, finished the film uncredited (including doing the voiceovers), and released it, kick-starting Rebane's career as a horrendous filmmaker. Thank you, Mr. Lewis.The plot, if you can call it that: a spacecraft crash-lands in America, and the retrieval team that goes to find the astronaut finds it empty. It seems the astronaut has been irradiated, and is now a ten-foot-tall cannibal mutant. Or something like that. Needless to say, every victim of the monster (other than the poor helicopter pilot who was sent to retrieve him--opportunistic murder FTW!) is someone who was doing something baaaaaaaaad. "If only she'd danced with her boyfriend instead of that other boy...". Yes. That's an actual line from the voiceover.It is said that the producers of Mystery Science Theater 3000 considered this the worst film they'd seen until they first saw Manos: The Hands of Fate. I disagree; this is far, far worse than Manos could ever hope to be. Of course, I think this because Manos didn't have the simplistic, and utterly stupid, moralistic streak Lewis forced upon this movie, but that's by far not the only problem here. The acting is torrentially bad. (Yes, I know that makes no grammatical sense, but it popped into my head and I like it, so I'm leaving it there.) The direction is hackneyed and wooden. The editing seems to have been done by tossing the footage into a blender and pasting together whatever came out. The soundtrack is... well, okay, you have to watch this movie if only to hear Herschell Gordon Lewis' velvety voiceovers combined with the awful, electronic lounge music in most of the movie (and the bop in the very few scenes that give the movie the second half of its title). Seriously, Lewis' voiceovers? If you can ignore the moralistic dreck, they're the best thing about the movie. The guy could've sold ice to eskimos. Were he still around today, he'd have Ron Popeil over a barrel.Truly, one of the worst movies ever made. (half)

$review_text.: This is a deliriously silly little movie, but it's fun to watch.  Kim Basinger utilizes her breathtaking beauty to its fullest as she discovers the joys of becoming human, from sneezing to sex to ham and cheese on rye with mayo.  Basinger's comic timing carries the movie, and even the usually disposable Dan Aykroyd's performance is comic and he and Basinger have a good chemistry.  There are some delightful sequences, e.g., when Kim has to discover how to kiss, her alien ally shows her films of several different types of kisses, and when she has to have sex, she does a sensual striptease replete with windblown hair and all.  Jon Lovitz is around for comic relief as Aykroyd's bachelor brother, and it's all mindless nonsense; it's also quite entertaining.  Basinger is a blast.

From out of no where, this movie came recommended on Amazon, so I figured, what the heck? The graphics and scenery are fantastic and the story, though standard fare, is very enjoyable
The level of humor is there and the ending does have one fact that was unexpected, though after the film was over, we realized that it was better that way

My favorite parts were the scenery, and I would rewind the DVD to see some of the backgrounds again

After a while though, we just continued with our film
This is definitely on our list of films that we must own.

$REVIEW.: Any parent of a young child knows, that inevitably their child will latch on to some film or TV program and insist on seeing it oh say... three hundred times a week (O.K., I might be exaggerating a bit...but just a little, bit)! In my case I have been very lucky, because my two year old toddler has become enamored beyond belief with the Pixar animated film, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;. I say &quot;lucky&quot; because if I'm going to sit down and view one disc hundreds of times on the old DVD player, then it might as well be something that's beautifully artistic, well written, imaginatively directed and featuring some of the best comedians and charactor actors in Hollywood as well as the international acting community. I guess what I'm trying to say is that if your age 2 or 102 your going to enjoy this movie. For anyone who's been hiding in an enime since the film's 2003 theatrical release it is an underwater story of a timid, over protective, widowed, clown fish named Marlin (neurotically played by Albert Brooks), who goes on an adventurous/comedic journey with a absent-minded, blue tang (hilariously played by Ellen DeGeneres) in search of his only son, Nemo (Alexander Gould), who has been stolen from the coral reef, apon which they live. Meanwhile, Nemo is trapped in an Australian, Dentist's office fish tank. He and the other aquatic inhabitants of the tank (including the voices of William DeFoe, Brad Garrett and Allison Janney) are attempting various plots to escape (a'la Steve McQueen's &quot;The Great Escape&quot;) and get back to the ocean (&quot;All drains lead to the Ocean&quot;).Along the way, the film imparts the ideal that although we still have to be protective &amp; vigilante of our children, we also have to let go, just a little bit, to let them experience, what life has to offer. Where do you start with what makes this film great? Do we start with the brilliant, computer animation? This is just a visually beautiful film to watch. It is like a painting in motion.You could turn the sound off and just serenely watch the changes in light and shadows throughout the film. It really seems like you are watching something under the sea. How about the great script? As, mentioned before, I have watched this movie many times and have yet to tire of the plot, well rounded characters or fast and funny dialogue.It's fun to try and pick up the pop cultural references made in the script (a shark named Bruce for all the &quot;Jaws&quot; fans out there). It seems like every time I watch this film, I discover something new in the script that gives me a chuckle. Also the casting in this film is just perfect! It's unbelievable how much comedic chemistry, actors, Albert Brooks and Ellen Degenres have together. You could close your eyes and listen to these two banter back and forth and it would still be thouroughly entertaining. Kudos also for all the actors, who do the voices for the fish in the tank. I love the gravity in actor, William DeFoe's line readings as Gil, the angel fish, who acts as ring leader for the bunch. Brad Garrett (of &quot;Everyone Loves Raymond&quot; fame)is equally good as a comically, deep voiced, blow fish. Finally, I want to mention Composer, Thomas Newman's wonderful musical score, that adds so much to the story and it's emotional impact.It leaves a lump in my throat everytime I hear it! I truely believe this film will historically go on to become an animated movie classic in the same way that &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, &quot;Pinnochio&quot; and &quot;Fantasia&quot; have. This is great film that belongs in any DVD collection. Highly recommended for viewers young and old alike!

$review_text.: If this film were to be released in today's society, it would not be looked upon with the greatest of ease.  Mothers, victims, and Michael Moore would talk about this film as being a perfect reason why guns are a problem in our society.  It would be similar to making a sequel to Natural Born Killers and hoping that it sweeps the Oscars.  It just wouldn't happen.  Yet, in 1949 this film worked.  With a growing interest in firearms began building, the studio that released this film decided it would take a chance and release this little ditty co-staring John Dall and Peggy Cummins while the main name in lights at the marquee is "GUNS".  Throughout the film, director Joseph Lewis tries to demonstrate to us that "guns don't kill people, people kill people" by having us follow these two hapless victims lead by destruction by the forceful fist of the gun.Through powerful imagery, detailed character studies, and creative direction, Deadly is the Female proves that it is more than just a simple black and white film about the evil of weapons.  Dall and Cummins are perfectly matched as the mismatched bandits on the run from the law.  Dall built such a strong character from the start to the finish of this film that I honestly forgot that I was watching a movie.  His inability to kill coupled with Cummins disrespect of life provided some of the best dialogue, interaction, and intensity that I have ever seen in a film.  I could watch these two characters in anything and I would still be entranced.  The fire in their eyes, the passion in their voices, and the eventual crumbling of their own selves was vividly beautiful.  I am not ashamed to say that the acting in this film could easily be put next to the work of those high paid in Hollywood today and be seen as the same (or better).  There is something about these two that forces us to look deeper into them.  From the beginning we settle in with our connection and never let go of our two characters.  We watch everything they do with a close eye and cheering whenever they escape from the law.  While the "gun" is the main character, the two wielding the weapon take the film to a new level.One can only speak of the acting so much before you have to bring in the direction from Lewis and the cinematography that only give the actors room to showcase their talent.  Lewis' direction is immaculate.  His attention to detail and scene set up is one of the best I have ever witnessed.  The scene that comes immediately to mind is early in the film when the friends are telling their story to the judge about how Bart couldn't kill the mountain lion.  When he refuses and his friends try to shoot, the only camera angle we have is of the boys shooting with Bart's fist in the frame.  His fist clenches everytime the gun is shot.  This was amazing how well this built Bart's character for the rest of the film.  Lewis knows this film.  You can see it with every shot that he takes.  He is excited and mesmerized by the characters, which translates onto the film perfectly.  He takes his passion and pushes it towards the cinematography as well.  There are several shots of our two "love-birds" driving the car to their next heist.  Lewis builds so much intensity in those little spaces that it lingers throughout the rest of the film.  The Savings and Loan Building heist is what immediately comes to my mind.  When the two are searching for a parking space to rob the institution you just get this feel of humanity and nervousness.  It kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.So, we have the top-notch acting, the intricate and detailed direction followed by a simple, yet effective story.  Love plays second fiddle to the gun as we see a story that is not unlike ones that we currently see invading our multiplex.  I think for me it was exciting to just see the era that this movie was filmed.  Another reviewer mentioned the scenes of the gun in the window of a store and the one-man police station on the California border was hysterical and somewhat eerie as well.  I couldn't agree more.  While this may have been exaggerated at the time, it still provided a pleasing look as to where we have progressed to since then (and maybe because of this film!).Overall, this film really impressed me.  I am a fan of films made in the 40s, and Deadly is the Female is no exception.  This era of film continually breaks new boundaries for me and proves that Hollywood may not be as creative as we think.  I see these films made in the 40s, and see the exact same types of stories in today's movie theaters.  Is there plagiarism happening or is Hollywood just recycling to continue to allure audiences to dish out more money?  The world may never know, but what I do know is that if you ever have the chance to see Deadly is the Female, I suggest it.  Powerful, stunning, and beautifully captured onto film, it will not disappoint.  Enjoy.Grade: ***** out of *****
$SUMMARY.: You'll never make big money. You're a two-bit guy.

$REVIEW.: The Virginian is my favorite western TV show to watch. I like the show, the characters and what they stood for. Each week was a different adventure for The Virginian, Trampas, Judge Garth and Steve Hill. Although the Virginian, Trampas and some of the other characters wasn't always on the show every week it still was a great show to watch. Judge Garth (Lee J. Cobb) played the Judge and owner of the Shiloh ranch from 1962 to 1966. After that different actors came in and took over Shiloh ranch. The Virginian was about a cowboy back in the 1890's in the Wyoming territory. He was hired on to be Judge Garth's ranch foreman. The show always had the best of that era's actors on their show like Lee Marvin, Charles Bronson just to name a couple. It was the first hour and a half TV western of it's time to air on TV each week. If you like westerns I would highly reccommend buying this 11 dvd set. Sandra K.

$REVIEW.: One day film historians will look back on this era as the time when special effects truly achieved legendary heights.  After all, this is the era of the "Matrix" and "Lord Of the Rings" trilogies, the era where the technology of filmmaking has made it possible to show anything the mind can conceive, and do so believably.In that future day when yet-unborn historians wax philosophic about this watershed period in time, "LXG" will be mentioned frequently as a prime example of how the technology also made it possible for films to be spectacularly stupid while looking and sounding as brilliant as the best of them.  FX appears to be the only reason this film was made, and the only part of the entire production that received much attention.Sean Connery and a cast of mostly unknowns or little-knowns barrel their way through an anorexic script with plot holes large enough for its own monstrously super-sized Nautilus submarine to plow through.  The Venice plot line, for example, including the exposition, action scenes, and execution, couldn't have made less sense if the dialogue were in Swahili with no subtitles.The film's version of Mr. Hyde looks like nothing more than a Macy's parade balloon on steroids, so they couldn't even get all the FX right.  In one scene we're also expected to believe the beast can breathe underwater....oh yeah, that's right after Dr. Jekyll magically locates his potion approximately two seconds after he's dived into a sinking Nautilus scene that otherwise seems to have been transposed directly out of a print of "Titanic."The legend of Allan Quartermain hasn't suffered this badly since Richard Chamberlain starred in a 1985 remake of "King Solomon's Mines," rush-produced in the wake of "Raiders Of the Lost Ark."  What's it take for an Africa-based Brit to get a break in the movie biz these days?

I found the music to be desperately trying to pump emotion into a nearly lifeless storyline. I really don't see the draw for this film; I think it would have worked much better as a documentary.Did anyone notice that the lighting for the baseball on-field scenes looked totally staged; not at all what a live game (on TV) looks like.  And why did I have to listen to the character of Billy Beane's daughter sing that silly song...twice?!Wow...really...much ado about nothing.

$review_text.: C.O.P.S - Volume 2A good series with memorable main characters and a memorable music theme. C.O.P.S. I brought both Volume 1 and 2 knowing that there was going to be video degradation. Well, with basically about 11 episodes per disk(except for the 1st disks of Vol. 1 and 2 which contains previews or a full episode of other series)the video quality is very poor. It looks like a blurry vhs tranfer of  medium quality(even if some sharpening filter was used it looks bad even on my crt)and it looks like the picture sways left to right. I do not know if they used the best sources available but I will be more careful next time with Mill Creek and Cookie Jar products. I know alot of 1970s and 1980s video series were shot mostly with poor video sources so I took a chance. By comparison: [ASIN: B004DTU2X4 He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: The Complete First Season] also by Mill Creek with  approx.10 episodes per dvd except disk 7 and extras disk 8, had "better quality" video.

$review_text.: Okay- My biggest worry when entering the theater was that I would be so worried about how this movie would measure up to "the Nightmare Before Christmas"- you can't read a review for this film that doesn't mention it, and there are few that don't compare it-Luckily for me- I was able to put my worries aside and other than a few parts (mostly the music) I was able to enjoy the movie for what it offered.The story is very different , and visually it's amazing- but the most amazing thing is Johnny Depp- who did the best non Johnny Depp act I've ever seen- I almost forgot it was him- while Joanna Lumly and Tracey Ulman almost snuck by me- (Michael Gough was pretty obvious though- I mean- it looked like him)I did have a slight problem with some of the character designs though- mostly Victoria's father- and the Vandort family driver- Victoris' Father was a huge ball of a man on toothpick legs- while the driver's face - well- was very reminiscent of - uh- a very specific part of a man's anatomy- well- three different pieces in one location - twig and berries- N-E-WhoThe story is about two people - Victor and Victoria,who are to be wed- even though they've never met each other- mainly to benefit the interests of both sets of parents- Victoris's to gain some finances, being that they are now penniless, and Victor's (whom Victoria's Mother calls the Nouveau Riche)- to gain some status in the town after their fish business apprently boomed-Duting their rehearsal, Victor can't seem to get his voes right and accidently sets his soon to be Mother In Law's dress on fire- he wanders in into the cemetary practicing when he unintentionally speaks his vows and slips the ring onto what he thinks is a tree branch- but turns out to be the waiting hand of the Corpse Bride- who has been waiting for the moment her entire afterlife,(she was murdered while waiting for her love to elope)  and is more than willing to accept- and takes Victor down to the Underworld, where Victor learns that the afterlife isn't as dead as he thinks (it turns out to be much more lively than his own living town)  He starts to develp a love for his new bride, but still yearns to be with his fiancee- whom he has also fallen in love with- to make matters worse, the Mysterious Lord Barkus visits with an agenda all his own- and the movie will keep you guessing to what will happen- which is a nice change from so many romantic comedies that don't really leave much of the ending to the imagination.The music fares pretty well- Remains of the Day is toe tapping fun, but the best musical pieces are Victor's Solo - and the Piano Duet (between Victor and Emily - the Corpse Bride)- unbelievably beautiful- I wish they were longer!This is a fantastic movie- and I can't wait to see it again- let alone get it on DVD- and I'm pretty sure that Nightmare fans will love it- and those not so much fans may even enjoy it-It's no Nightmare, but a beautifully done film- and if it doesn't win this year's animation Oscar- ther is no hope for Cinema-

$review_text.: Having just returned from the theaters to view this film, I figured it was my duty to stop by Amazon.com and express my views to my fellow movie fanatics who may stop by here to see what people thought.As I stated in the title, this is a fitting third chapter in the series

 It lacks a bit in the acting department and story development, but more than makes up for it with the special effects and excitement

As the titles have gone on, the dinosaurs have gotten more and more realistic, to the point in this one where they are seamlessly integrated into the story
 I won't give anything a way here, which makes it a bit tough to tell you about any of these scenes, but suffice to say that this movie will, as the others in this series have done, amaze you with the level of work gone into the detail of the dinosaurs.Again, as I said before, the plot of this movie will not garner it a &quot;Best Picture&quot; nomination, but neither will it severely disappoint you

 Just remember, it's a summer blockbuster, a popcorn movie in a series of popcorn movies, and if you go in with that mindset, you'll have a fun time at this movie!Just go out and see it now, and stop reading these cheesy reviews!

$review_text.: .... and i say Thank You for making HIGH TENSION or atleast having it released here. Oh yeah cant forget the Statue of Liberty, I guess thanks for that also. Anyway.I was forgetting that people are allowed to make R-Rated HORROR movies which is exactly what this is. This mnovie is extremely violent and extremely well done, as i rate nothing 5 stars but this movie does not have one flaw,IMO atleast. The only thing I didnt like was the fact that the movie went from being dubbed ( which bothered people also, I dont know why, I guess people need something to complain about )to subtitles. Basically half the movie is dubbed and the other half is in subtitles, but that in no way has anything to do with this flick and the way it was made, directed ,edited and acted out.This movie is no less than a true horror and a classic to be no question. The movie has a geat twist at the end ( which many didnt like, but this ending could have gone 2 ways, but im still satisfied with this one ), and with the ending giving me goose bumps ( The very last scene ).This whole movie is sick and twisted and gives you a ride of non-stop violence and pure terror-suspense through out the whole film. Plus one of the main things I had mentioned to my friend only 10-15 minutes into the movie is the music which is very creepy and sets a great mood to this movie.To see something like this lets me know there are still some true fans and/or film makers/writters who know what horror is, and this movie is a prime example.There is no humor at all in this movie, which is what I love something made to make you jump which the 4 or 5 scenes that are suppose to make you jump do in fact make you jump.Horrors need to be made like this i give 100% kudos and respect to this film maker for giving us fans horror like it should be.

$REVIEW.: Made in Germany, circa 1943 "Munchausen" starring Hans Albers is a superb interpretation of Raspe's stories, based on a German noble of the eighteenth century who took great pleasure in telling tall tales.And here we have several layers.  On the surface, this is a movie that made great use of the technology of the day and the locations available to Germans at the height of World War II.  Beautiful costumes and magnificent settings (especially Venice) support lively action, very compentent acting, and a great story.  The story is that of Hieronymous Baron Munchausen, an adventurer, rogue, officer in the German and Russian armies, lover, and all around charming scoundrel.  He falls into the bed of Catherine the Great, Tsarina of Russia, flies on a cannon ball, travels to the moon, finds himself in the serigalio of the Sultan of Turkey, and romances his way across Europe.The truth of Freiherr Munchausen is only slightly less exciting.  He was a Prussian noble and really served in the Russian and German armies, travelled all over Europe, and generally lived life to its fullest.  Certainly the kind of guy you'd want at a party, but not the sort of guy you'd trust around your wife or daughter.  And telling the sort of story that inspired this movie was a great pleasure for him.And while made in Germany in 1943, there is no obvious propaganda.  I didn't observe any, and it certainly didn't impact the plot.  It is important to note that the lead actor's lover fled German for Switzerland in the 1930's, and they were reunited after the war.  Albers is unlikely to have had any loyalty to the regime at the time of production.A quick note; if you are sensitive to displays of the female form or romantic inuendo, this one may not be for you.  To my sensibilities, the casual attire and discussions of intimate adventure were tastefully handled.A great movie from some of the best classical stories.E.M. Van Court

$REVIEW.: I remember watching this movie in the mid 80s, having rented it at the local EROL's in excitement after reading the FANTASTIC & ScArY novel B4hand (countless times in fact). I occasionally watched it years afterward when it plays on looping cable. Let's just say this is NOT one of Carpenter's best!!!Don't MISinterpret me as a Carpenter-"basher"! He used real creativity in directing two of mi favorite horror/suspense classics, HALLOWEEN & THE FOG. But those were vehicles (pardon the pun) of his own creation, along wi Debra Hill. In the case of CHRISTINE, it looks like someone just gave him a script, said "here U go, direct this!!!" & he did so withOUT reading the book or its elements!Thus the movie is a letDOWN compared 2 the book as it CLEARLY WAS MADE 2 appeal to fans of Stephen King! It seems almost lazily cheap to imply that Christine is an "animal-force" with a life all her own when in fact (the book) she was nothing more than a conduit for the REAL EVIL villain- her prior-sole hateful & sinister owner: Roland Lebay who projected his rage, fury & menace onto & into the car like a storage battery over his lifetime thus her rampage was really a reflection of HIS rage. But Carpenter transposes those two elements (BIG mistake) 2 make it seem Lebay was just another victim of Christine's.Other weaknesses R the acting which is FLAT & with no real emotion, the actors woodenly reading lines rite out of the book. The attacks R dull & lack the horrific violence that demonstrated the car's power in the novel which was told in a suspensful drawn-out type of story-telling that the film neglects. That radio playing is a lame gag & that final scene ("U two R heroes, U kno...") is a joke. Junkins was killed off in the story, BTW- a "post"reporting by the narrator that is left 2 the reader's imagination!Nice try bi Carpenter.....but this is a story that NEEDS 2 B remade, definetly!!!

$REVIEW.: The movie centers around a shock radio jock played by Eric Bogosian, who's life reflects pretty much his grim view of life.  Divorced from his ex-wife played by Ellen Green.  He often has to deal with sordid topics that at times he can get burnt out and disgusted from, but also on occassion tries to make a difference by trying to get a rapist to seek help.  He oftentimes shows vitriolic disgust at every type of degenerate and dellusional lost soul, and sometimes that is given to him in return leading up to the shocking ending.

$REVIEW.: Besides the great cast, detailed plot and good music, I really enjoy the feel of the setting.  Everything from the spacesuits, the buildings, the equipment, even the shuttle, have a feel of being functional, of being able to really work.  Io is a harsh, terrible, place to live and mining is always hard on the workers.  The story shows us one future, mankind's guest for wealth and profit, even on one of the moons around Jupiter.Sean Connery as William T. O'Neil is perfect - he is a flawed man, a father whose family don't want to live in a mining colony, a Marshal whose men refuse to help him, a law officer of a colony that is too scared to support him.  A Hero who does not know why he is a Hero.  The plot and the characters are in the foreground, as specil effects and designs are used to bring out the story, not overwhelm it.A must for any sci-fi fan, a fan of Sean Connery or any fan of good movies.

$review_text.: Chopping Mall (Jim Wynorski, 1986)Pretty standard Corman-produced fare from the mid-eighties. It's the year 2000, and the world is still shopping-mall centered. (And oh, yeah, fashion and slang haven't changed since the mid-eighties, either. Fascinating!) A security company have just instituted the latest and greatest in security technology--security robots aimed at keeping the burglar population down and not needing to pay human guards. "It's foolproof", the security consultant says. "What could go wrong?" Famous last words. Eight mall employees have an after-hours party in the furniture store during a lightning storm that (of course) short-circuits the system. We first realize something's wrong when one of the robots kills a janitor. The kids, of course, are still blissfully unaware. But that will soon change!It's your typical Corman-factory crap, but if you're looking for a slasher film with a couple of variations on the usual theme, Chopping Mall will fill the bill. It's not entirely awful, Barbara Crampton gets in some gratuitous nudity (I think exposing her breasts was part of her standard contract, something for which we should all be thankful), and Wynorski (who also co-wrote the script) and Corman bring back some characters from earlier Corman films for an amusing twist on the whole meta thing years before it got popular. All in all, a surprisingly unstupid Corman flick, especially considering Wynorski (whose greatest achievement to date has been the Bare Wench Project series) was at the helm. **

$REVIEW.: Firstly I would only recommend The Life Of Brian to either a) die-hard Python fans b) someone with a genuinely warped sense of humour, and of course c) a complete nutter. If none of the above fits your frame I would suggest to stay away, as you will in all probability have your IQ offended. If not, WATCH THIS FILM!!!The plot is very loosely based on the general hatred towards the romans, despite the fact they brought education, sanitation, roads, wine, pretty much everything in society back then. Brian is born, not far from Jesus causing a brief confusion for the three wise men, he leads a normal life until he falls for a woman. This woman is not just any woman, she's a member of the People's Front Of Judea, not to be mistaken for the [...] Judean People's Front. Brian joins the group and is caught by the romans during a failed mission to capture Pilot's wife. Brian escapes and somehow finds himself being followed by hundreds of people claiming him to be the Messiah. Brian is eventually caught and crucified (there's a very funny running joke about how pathetic crucifixion is) and all of his friends fail to save him, even the dreaded Judean People's Front fail, commiting suicide and claiming "eh, that showed 'em".The film contains so many funny moments, I'll just list a few:Palin as Caesar is superb, he's got a speech impediment and can't say the letter 'r' without pronouncing it 'w'. He has a friend named Bigus Dicus who also has a speech impediment, this time it's the 's' that's the problem.One joker who keeps popping up has an argument with another man while Jesus is trying to speak, he keeps saying the man has a big nose - "Well it is true, you do have a very big nose" - "I'm only pointing out the obvious, you've got a very big nose." - "shut up big nose" - "listen big nose". It's very funny when you watch it.The funniest bit in the whole film is when Brian is being chased by the Romans and runs up a spire, only to find there's no stairs down so he jumps to certain death. Luckily for him an alien spaceship swoops down and saves him, goes back up into space, has an engine failure and crashed about five foot away from where it all started. Brian walks out and a man who watched it all says "You lucky bastard!"I won't go in to any more detail, you just have to watch the film.

$review_text.: While there is nothing funny about a 16-year-old girl dealing with her unexpected pregnancy, Ellen Page portrayed Juno as a quirky teenager who was blatantly honest and surprisingly humorous.  Of all pregnant teen films, this was the most comical, however, the pain and consequences of making an adult decision came through loud and clear.At first I didn't like Juno because she was a little difficult to understand, like she was speaking a different language known only to her peers.  Then she quickly became likeable because in spite of her mannerisms, her innocence showed through.  The girl was not street-wise, she was just a regular kid.  She wasn't flippant, she was actually overly practical and mature, and most of all, she had a character strong enough not to care what people thought of her.She had a non-conventional, but loving and supportive family.  Her stepmother was funny, and I like the way her family called her June Bug at times.  And I loved the change of seasons and the constantly jogging football team, or was it a track team?While it was cute and had a happy ending, I also found it to be sad and wished her family kept the baby until she was ready for it.  But then that would have ruined the effect that nothing is perfect, but that sometimes things work out anyway if we want them to.  It also was successful in showing that life goes on.

$review_text.: This 2004 Paris National Op&eacute;ra production of Strauss's last opera 'Capriccio' is extraordinarily successful

The casting is luxurious: Ren&eacute;e Fleming as the Countess; Dietrich Henschel as her brother, the Count; the fast-rising baritone Gerald Finley as the musician, Olivier; tenor Rainer Tr&ouml;st as the poet, Flamand; Anne-Sofie von Otter as the glamorous Parisian actress, Clairon; the Wagnerian bass Franz Hawlata as the impresario, La Roche; Annamarie Dell'Oste as the Italian soprano; Barry Banks as the Italian tenor; the big-voiced (and hunky) bass Petri Lindroos as the stentorian Major-Domo; and, still singing extremely well, the venerable tenor, Robert Tear, as the poor sleepy prompter, Monsieur Taupe


Add to that the inventive staging by Robert Carsen, the sumptuous stage sets by Michael Levine and costumes by Anthony Powell (the Countess's gown in her magnificant final scene is gorgeous), amusing choreography by Jean-Guillaume Bart, as well as the rich orchestral accompaniment by the orchestra of the Paris National Op&eacute;ra under Ulf Schirmer, and you have a real winner
I have not seen the competing version of 'Capriccio' from the San Francisco Opera starring Kiri te Kanawa, so I can't compare the two productions

But I am completely satisfied by this one.The opera, whose libretto clearly indicates that the action takes place in the 1770s, is set by Carsen in the Nazi years, in German-occupied France

Aside from some jarring anachronisms (references to Gluck and Piccinni as contemporaries, the Count and Clairon going to Paris using 'four horses' [to which Clairon archly suggests she is surprised the Count isn't using 'six horses'] and so on), the setting is reasonably apt
The Nazi presence is not obtrusive or freighted with 'meaning' at all


The costumes and sets are consonant with the early 1940s -- indeed, Ren&eacute;e Fleming never looked lovelier with her 40s hair-do and gown


The other conceit in this production is that it supposedly actually takes place on, rather than being acted out upon, a stage (rather than the libretto's indication that it takes place in the Countess's palais), with some singers occasionally placed in the otherwise empty auditorium of the Palais Garnier

This is more or less appropriate since the subject of the opera is Opera itself and a debate about whether the words or the music are more important
(Olivier: 'Prima la musica, poi le parole.' 'No, no,' answers Flamand, 'Prima le parole, e poi la musica.') And, of course, the Musician and the Poet personify their two arts and vie for the hand of the Countess


It is Strauss's and the librettist's, Clemens Krauss's, masterstroke that her choice, at the opera's end, is left unclear

Ren&eacute;e Fleming, in the long final (and musically stupendous) solo scena, is ravishing, both musically and visually


The Major-Domo's final comment - 'Dinner is served' - serves the same purpose as the appearance of Mahomet in the final moments of 'Der Rosenkavalier', to bring us down to earth and remind us that this is only a play after all
Brilliant dramaturgy.One cannot say enough about the ensemble aspects of this opera and how they are handled here

Strauss denoted the opera as a Conversation Piece; there are, for instance, three octets in the opera -- one laughing, one quarrelling and, most delicious, the comments of the eight servants after the principals have gone


The opening string sextet (the Overture) and the 'Moonlight Music' (the intermezzo leading to the final scene) are so gorgeous that one wants to hear them again (and I did, using the magic of the remote control -- aren't DVDs wonderful?)

The transformation of Flamand's sonnet, 'Kein andres, das mir so im Herzen loht', first declaimed hammily by the Count, then read poetically by Flamand himself, and then set to music by Olivier and sung gloriously in the final scene by the Countess is a marvel

There is just so much to love in this opera, it's no surprise that it has become, after 'Rosenkavalier,' 'Elektra,' 'Salome' and 'Ariadne auf Naxos,' his most produced opera.If you love Strauss and don't know this opera, you owe it to yourself to get either this 2DVD set or the San Francisco DVD of it
Or, better, get yourself to the next production that is staged anywhere near you
This is front-rank Strauss, and a miracle of his old age.Scott Morrison

The movie itself, except for the basic idea of children fighting to the death, is a very clean movie. No bad language, no gore, no real bloody fight scenes. It has some very touching moments of romance and love to family. I recommend this movie to all audiences, just do not let the concept of kids in an arena fighting to the death bother you.

$review_text.: The claimed catalyst for this four hour miniseries was the 100th anniversary of the Titanic's sinking on April 14, 1912.  If the makers of this TV event truly wanted to commemorate the actual history of Titanic, a better idea might have been to begin with the news of the disaster as it reached the world followed by the American inquest wherein surviving crew and passengers were questioned in an effort to find out the truth of what happened - and these accounts could have led to the flashback structure that is in place in the miniseries.  The difference is this: Julian Fellowes' Forsythe Saga-esque script has less to do with the actual historicity of Titanic and more to do with a grand soap opera dealing with class structure in the early part of the 20th century. The invented characters who interact with some historical personages are, by and large, cardboard cutouts.  Much of what the invented passengers and crew do and say is rather unbelievable and largely cliched.  The miniseries is also laden with historical inaccuracies, despite the producer's and writer's and various other crew members' claims to have striven for absolute accuracy as much as humanly possible.  To realize that the entire production has more to do with its fictions than its facts, one need only watch the second DVD's six making-of featurettes.  On those self-aggrandizing  featurettes very little is said about the historical Titanic and its sinking - and much more is said about what a great miniseries those involved are creating.  As several other Amazonians have said, the true stories of the actual Titanic passengers and crew are far more fascinating and interesting than the made-up characters in this miniseries.Yet despite my hesitations and reservations, this script is actually mostly much better than James Cameron's script for his bloated disaster of a disaster movie.  His fictional folks were truly juvenile and insipid.  When Dawson teaches Rose how to spit like a man just so she can spit into the face of her cardboard villain husband many reels later is just one sad instance of clumsy, overt manipulation of basically shoddy material to begin with.  So the romances and intrigues in this miniseries are, actually, much better conceived and written then the Jack/Rose romance of Cameron's sloppy film.  Having said that, the characters in Julian Fellowes' tale of Titanic are still mainly made of the stuff of soap operas.  Why invent - when true stories still cry out from the ghostly depths of the Sea and Time waiting to be told before they are truly forgotten?  More people know of the phony, fictitious and anachronistic Jack Dawson than they do about Jacques Futrelle.  And that is a true pity.Still-and-all, this take on the great tragedy is still entertaining and worthwhile.  Most anything that has to do with Titanic usually is entertaining in one way or another. Even the '60s TV series TIME TUNNEL's take on Titanic was entertaining. As for the film under dicussion, however, there are other troubles: the interiors of the ship are extremely sub-standard. I'd like to think that the grand staircase was purposefully left out so as not to make viewers long to see Jack Dawnson standing beneath the clock waiting for Rose. But more likely, it was a budgetary concern. The music score is mostly extremely uninspired and therefore annoying.  There is way too much of it and all it does is attempt to push the viewers' buttons and dictate way too obviously what it is we should be feeling since the deep feelings we should be experiencing somehow aren't always there.  Once a viewer gleans just how manipulative the storyline actually is, the ability to empathize and sympathize becomes quite tasked.The overlapping flashback structure of the story is quite interesting and well-reasoned.  It reminded me of CITIZEN KANE's complex structure in many ways.  And in the last episode - which does rally to land a handful of emotional wallops - is an absolutely brilliantly conceived and executed scene of the sinking ship shown as background to the frantic foreground search atop a lifeboat and in the icy waters of one brother trying to find the other.  This one brief scene alone is worth the price of admission. It speaks volumes about individual human loss in relationship and juxtaposition to the larger, background canvas of the great liner's imminent death as it lists and lights blink on and off as it dies and readies to sink. As the ship dies, so dies the one brother's desperate hopes of finding his own brother alive. I daresay that this one sequence gave me a stronger sense of being there than anything in the Cameron depiction of the actual sinking.  It is that brilliant!  Was it scripted and storyboarded as such - or did the CGI folks conceptualize it?  I do not know.  All I know is that it is stunningly realized and executed - as are the truly haunting recreations of the ship slowly sinking below the icy Atlantic as the lifeboat survivors watch in numbed shock and horror.  At this point, the music likewise rallies and matches the scene perfectly.Despite its own faults, A NIGHT TO REMEMBER is still the best dramatic recreation of the Titanic tragedy.  The Clifton Webb/Barbara Stanwyck TITANIC is memorable for the truly touching fictional tale that is its main essence.  Cameron's TITANIC goes overboard with way too many special effects - and its fictional story goes overboard...and sinks.  This miniseries, despite its many faults, is still entertaining and worth seeing - if only for that one incredible shot.Bon Voyage!!!

$REVIEW.: Taut direction and splendid performances distinguish this World War II thriller about a big game hunter pursued by Nazis after he is caught targeting Hitler in his gunsights, and manages to escape back to Britain.  Walter Pidgeon is fine as the stalwart "Rogue Male" (the film's original title, taken from the book on which the script was based), and George Sanders is supremely villainous as the crafty Nazi who is tracking him.  On the distaff side, Joan Bennett is touching and convincing as an ill-fated Cockney streetwalker who is caught up in the conflict between warring ideologies; this is the first film of four that she made with director Fritz Lang, for whom she gave some of her finest film performances in the mid-forties (including "The Woman in the Window" and "Scarlet Street", made for their own independent company, Diana Productions).Briskly paced and edited, "Man Hunt" remains a tense thriller throughout its 105 minute running time, right up to its suspenseful climax.  Seldom screened on television or in revival, and never before released on video, this classic film (which enjoys a small but avid cult following) has been long-awaited and arrives highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: When Doctor Who returned to our screens in 2005, even for the disinterested, it was probably THE British TV event of the year. For the die hard fans, it was a dream come true. Finally the BBC was giving it the profile, the budget, the schedule and the kudos that they felt it had always deserved. Russell T. Davis had reinvented a classic TV icon and made it even more exciting than ever and Christopher Eccleston brought a new edge to the world's longest running sci-fi TV hero.But before the first season had even run its course, Eccleston was gone. Never explaining why, after the huge relaunch, the BBC were already having to recast the role, running the risk of losing everything they'd built up in such a short space of time. Thankfully, (unlike so many times in the 1980's) the production team made a truly inspired decision to cast David Tennant in the role of the Doctor and keep the new found dynamism on track.Here is the complete first season of Tennant's stint as the Time Lord from Gallifrey, which I personally hope will be the first of many. He really has taken the role to heart and developed a truly engaging and charismatic Doctor - one that's on a par with the great Tom Baker for sure and outdoing many others who've taken the role in the past. All 14 episodes are included, starting with the hour-long 2005 Christmas special, followed by the 13 45-minute episodes from the spring of 2006.There are many fans of course who aren't particularly enamored of the new approach to their favorite time traveler. It is fair to say that the whole concept has become rather `soapy'. It's certainly no stretch to see that Eastenders seems to have a big influence over the style of the new direction. Whereas it brings an edge of reality to the series to flesh out the lives and emotions of the Doctor and his companions, it has to be said that in this particular season, that emotion is being somewhat overplayed. Sarah-Jane Smith is back at the Doctor's side in `School Reunion' after having been dumped from the TARDIS back in 1976. It's great to see Elisabeth Sladen back on form, but from a continuity point, it's not really true to the original series. Sarah-Jane did already meet up with the Doctor again, back in the 1983 20th anniversary special, The Five Doctors, and the hurt and despair explored now ignores that particular narrative completely. Every episode seems to have some emotional turmoil between the Doctor's current companion, Rose, and the Time Lord himself, which seems to always be edging them towards at least a romantic relationship, if not a full-blown sexual one. After a while, it seems this sub-text is always getting in the way of the main narrative of each story. Even the long awaited and definitely overdue clash between the Doctor's two most famous enemies, The Daleks and The Cybermen, is eventually pushed into the background to develop more of the Doctor/Rose relationship. It's not necessarily a bad thing, it's just overplayed. I for one would like to see less of Rose's emotions and those of her family and hopefully in the 2007 season, new characters will be handled differently.There are fewer extras than were included on the Eccleston season release, possibly to accommodate the extra episode. The short interim piece shown on the BBC's Children in Need charity telethon is included and there's a commentary for each story, often with on-screen visuals. A sixth disc includes the accompanying Doctor Who Confidential, behind the scenes documentaries, but there's little else. It's still a great package nonetheless.I hope the rumors of David Tennant's departure during the 2008 season are false. He's such a great Doctor; it would be a shame to lose him. But so far, most of the rumors about the series that have done the rounds have all pretty much turned out to be true. Still, they moved effortlessly from Eccleston to Tennant, so presumably they can do the same again. In the meantime, here's some wonderful Doctor Who to enjoy again.

$REVIEW.: Watching this movie for the first time I wasn't really sure of what to expect

But I was plasently suprised to find out how funny and greatly entertaining it was.The story begins with a group of unkempt looking bandits awaiting the arrival of there past leaders son to take over the "family business"


When the son of the Kissing Bandit arrives, they find out that that he is not only a softy from the east, but he thinks he is taking over his father's buisness as inkeeper, and knows nothing of his father's less then honorable career as a bandit


So, making do with what they have, the bandits begin to train him in the ways of his father only to have him fall into blunder after blunder, and in love with the Governor's daughter (Kathryn Grayson).Of course you know with such casting as Frank Sinatra and Kathryn Grayson, that this has to be a musical
Though there are some good dance profomances, especialy the fiesta dance number feturing Cyd Chirisse, Anne Milller, and Ricardo Montalban, I felt that the songs could have been stronger and more supportive of the story

They seemed to lack a little something to me because they were just inserted into the movie

Not that they weren't nice numbers, but the plot of the story didn't seem to weigh heavy on the shoulders of the preformances
In other words if I had seen the movie without them, I wouldn't have missed them.All in all though I would say that this is a great movie, and definitely worth watching

I do think though that this movie could probably be enjoyed more by a viewer that likes musicals anyways apposed to the just any veiwer.

$review_text.: While still nowhere near as good as the books, Prisoner of Azkaban fared the best of the first 3 Potter books in its transition to the silver screen. It had some problems, but overall, it was enjoyable.First, the good stuff: David Thewlis was perfect as Professor Lupin. His down-on-his-luck, yet noble portrayal, with just the right air of mystery, worked beautifully, the equal of the always good Alan Rickman as Snape. Michael Gambon was also a big improvement over Richard Harris as Dumbledore, and Emma Thompson clearly had fun as the daffy Professor Trelawney.The kids were generally well done in the way they were shown transitioning through adolescence here, and the gist of the plot - the hunt for escaped convict Sirius Black - held the right air of menace. The special fx were decent if not great. (The dementors, for example, were scary, but couldn't help but bring to mind, and suffer in comparison with, the ring wraiths from Lord of the Rings.)Moreover, what all too many reviewers fail to understand is that a book and a movie are different media for telling a story. I expect a film adaptation of a book to capture the spirit of the book, not necessarily to regurgitate every plot point and line of dialogue verbatim. The first two Potter movies faithfully repeated many (not all) of the stuff from the books, but it was stuff seemingly chosen at random. The result was that those movies felt disjointed, incoherant, and not at all like Harry Potter.Prisoner at least tries to be its own film, and as a result, it stays truer to the source, and ends up being a much better story.But there was some bad stuff: Draco Malfoy grew even more ludicrous, he was so pathetically whiny that it was hard to see him as threatening in any way. (In fairness, that's a problem that's growing in the books, too.) The actor who played Wormtail was just off - rather than craven, he came off as weaselly and silly. The complex plot of the book was hard to get across, and the movie only partly succeeds. There are definitely holes that will leave you scratching your head if you haven't read the books.The true HP fanatic will probably want to buy this movie, especially to tide you over until book 6 this summer.
$SUMMARY.: Flawed, but the best of the HP movies so far

$review_text.: This movie is a curiosity. It struggles to find a niche for itself, andalthough it has some interesting imagery and effects, the overalleffect seems rushed and incomplete. In a nutshell, a town is menaced bya mysterious carnival that arrives suddenly and it's up to two youngboys to uncover the truth. I found "Something Wicked This Way Comes"interesting, but I also found it quite unsatisfying. I came to the filmwith no knowledge of the plot and at the end of the film I wasn't muchthe wiser! As it stands, what we have is (slight spoilers just here):the arrival of the carnival, the two young friends generally exploringit and seeing too much, and the rest of the townsfolk somehow fallingunder some strange spell and/or disappearing.The two young leads are appealing but not capable of depicting enoughemotion to carry the movie, as their acting range is limited to littlemore than blank staring and surprise. Little better is the JasonRobards as the blond moppet's father, and all scenes between these twoare pretty wooden, even the crucial climactic rescue scene, which kindof dilutes any tension. The script doesn't help at all, in fact nobodyever seems to have anything important to say. Shame, because JonathanPryce is excellent as the carnival head honcho.The story would probably have benefited from being turned into a TVminiseries rather than this feature film. Something more along thelines of the original "Salem's Lot" series would have allowed the storyand characters to develop better, and we could have gradually gotinvolved in the little mini plots around each town-person who getswrapped up in the carnival's power, as well as explaining all thebewildering elements like the fortune teller, the big ticket seller whogets younger, the spiders, etc, etc. What the carnival is actuallydoing and why (and how!) should have been the most intriguing part ofthe film but it's so vaguely depicted that it meant I hardly gotinvolved in the mystery at all. I mean, I thought I got what washappening when they showed the frumpy teacher who gained her beauty butlost her sight, but what about the one armed football player who justgot younger with no ill-effects? And why did some of the victims turninto exhibits? As I said, I thought there were some good ideas in herebut they needed more room to grow so that we could have got the hang ofit all properly.
$SUMMARY.: Not fully developed

$REVIEW.: I purchased Vol. 1 which is a series of 6 Baby Einstein DVDs (Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Neptune, World Animals, Neighborhood Animals)for my baby when she was a newborn. She is now 17 months old, and she has never cared for any of them EXCEPT for the Neighborhood Animals DVD which depicts scenes of familiar animals like cows, horses, cats, dogs, etc. She really loves the part when they sing "Old MacDonald".  Baby Mozart is downright boring. I think overall the Baby Einstein series is over-rated.  I could put on a better puppet show myself using the toys in my living room.  I think a lot of folks, including myself, were intrigued by the catchy "Baby Einstein" name, because we all want to raise little Einsteins. I'm sure the folks at Baby Einstein are laughing all the way to the bank!  I haven't seen some of the other titles like Van Gogh, Numbers Nursery, Shakespeare, etc., so I don't know if these are any better, but with all the money i'm out on Vol.1, I won't be giving Baby Einstein another chance.  We much prefer the Brainy Baby and Baby's First Impressions (predecessor of the Brainy Baby series) series of products.  But, to each his own.

$review_text.: Simon Pegg and Nick Frost return to their most fertile territory, the comedy / action hybrid, with mixed results. A spiritual successor of sorts, The World's End is funny, manic and sincere in many of the same ways as Shaun of the Dead, but to far lesser degrees. It stretches for Shaun's emotional depth, but a thin, superficial set of characters can't match it. Its early action scenes are wild and entertaining, so excellent that I simply couldn't wait for the next variation, but that goodwill is quickly wasted when subsequent brawls merely rinse and repeat. Even Pegg's irreverent leading role, often relied upon to carry an iffy scene, doesn't carry the same weight he did in Hot Fuzz or SotD. In fact, in many ways he's repellent, even when a shining moment of truth seems poised to descend upon him against his will. Ultimately we're all rooting for him, but it's just by proxy and not because we genuinely want to see him triumphant. The first two acts are solid, if not excellent, but the plot's resolution rings hollow and its follow-through seems more like a dream sequence punk-out than an honest farewell. A mild disappointment.

$REVIEW.: I just read a review that declares Ultimate Avengers 2 the "Best Animated Superhero Movie of All-Time!" I'll go one better. It may be the best animated action movie of all-time, beating big boys like Titan AE, Transformers and The Iron Giant. Most sane people will soon agree that it certainly beats any single episode of Justice League, X-Men Evolution, Batman or Spider-Man. Some want to compare it to these TV series and their entire run but that's apples and oranges. If Ultimate Avengers spins off in to a series, then there can be discussion. As it stands now, it sets the bar quite high for future releases.Ultimate Avengers 1 was good but it had pacing issues. This movie moves fast and keeps you entertained from start to amazing finish. This is a smart and surprisingly interesting film that really delivers. Calling this movie a cartoon doesn't really seem right or do it justice. A+

$REVIEW.: It's a film that has been voted as "one of the worst films ever made" and it's also a film that has its fans because of its unusual sci-fi nature and that film is "Santa Claus Conquers the Martians".Released back in 1964, the film is based on a story written by Paul L

Jacobson and is directed by Nicholas Webster ("Gone are the Days!", "Mission Mars") and a screenplay by Glenville Mareth.The film would star John Call ("The Anderson Tapes", "Hangman's Knot", "Fearless Fagan"), Leonard Hicks ("Route 66&#8243;), Vincent Beck ("Vigilante", "...And Justice For All") and would be the film debut for actress Pia Zadora ("Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult", "Hairspray", "The Lonely Lady").While the film was lauded for just being bad, it would gain in popularity after being featured in an episode of "Mystery Science Theater 3000&#8243; in the '90s and since then, the film would be shown on Comedy Central since 1991 and also featured on "Elvira's Movie Macabre".And now, the film has been remastered for a Blu-ray release courtesy of Horizon Movies and was released in December 2012.VIDEO:"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians" is presented in 1:33:1 and while the film probably looks its best on Blu-ray, one should not think of this film to be pristine
 The intro has some flickering and it's important to note that on the rear of the package, the following message is featured:  Due to teh rarity of materials available, the master for this film was created from a 16 mm European print secured by Holland Releasing with the HD telecine and color correction completed by Fotokem/Burbank

 Since this print was originally created for television, it is presented in a 1:33:1 aspect ratio

 The original theatrical release of this film was projected in a matted 1:85:1 with a safe top and bottom

 As a result of the master having "removed the matte", this presentation of the film actually reveals additional information on the top and bottom of the frame.The film somewhat shows its age and is a bit soft, but it actually looks very good thanks to it being remastered in HD
 I didn't notice any compression problems at all
 But picture quality does show the unbalance of makeup during that time (which was evident in the HD releases of the "Star Trek" television series on Blu-ray) but while not pristine, its the best that "Santa Claus Conquers the Martians" will probably ever look.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"is presented in DTS-HD monaural

 It does have its issues with it not being cleaned up but for those who love listening to "Hooray for Santy Claus" (sung by Pia Zadorra and other children) during the intro, this is the best you'll hear of this song


 Also, dialogue is understandable

 Just don't expect a clean lossless audio track as you will hear a bit of hiss and crackle.SPECIAL FEATURES:"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians" come with the following special features:Santa's Cool Holiday Film Festival - (46:17) Featuring many Christmas clips, animated shorts, commercials from the 1950&#8242;s-1960&#8242;s featuring the Nelsons, Shari Lewis and Lambchop and more


 These are not separate and must be watched as a full featurette.Trailer - (1:57) A newer trailer for "Santa Claus Conquers the Martians".Stills Gallery - Featuring eight stills that can be viewed via your Blu-ray remote (or mouse/keyboard).JUDGMENT CALL:While "Santa Claus Conquers the Martians" will be seen as one of the worst films of all time, for science fiction fans, it's one of those films that people who believe in "it's so bad, it's good" will probably enjoy this film.The whole premise of martians going to Earth to kidnap Santa Claus and bring him to Mars is really far out and makes you wonder if the writer was on some drug, but watching it today, you can't help but enjoy it because it's so bad.You have a martian race who all wear these ugly green outfits, children on Mars who watch American television and martians who speak English


 You have your idiot martian and as for Santa Claus, I don't know about how others have felt over the years, but when I first watched this film, I felt Santa was a bit creepy.And this film's not going to win over sci-fans because costume design is terrible, makeup is not applied all that well (and the Blu-ray release makes these problems even more visible), special effects and set design is not all that great
 But once again, this film has earned its reputation for being bad, but yet there are a legion of fans who need their fix on "Santa Claus Conquers the Martians" because its bad
 People who grew up with this film as they have grown up with other annual Christmas favorites such as "A Christmas Story", "Home Alone", "It's a Wonderful Life" but instead of being a really good film, it's more of watching this film because it's so kitschy but so far out, that it makes you think if Glenville Mareth or Paul L

Jacobson were on drugs while creating this film.But to this day, I still watch this film when it airs on television and now watching on Blu-ray, this time watching it with my 9-year-old and he found it to be amusing and entertaining.As for the Blu-ray release, this is probably the best one is going to see of this film

 While the picture quality and lossless track is not pristine, it still benefits from its remastering


 So, for those hanging on to those old VHS tapes recorded from TV, go ahead and throw those away and get this Blu-ray instead


 Also, for those who are nostalgic or are curious of older Christmas commercials or shorts, you get 46 minutes of classic Christmas clips from the '50s and '60s also included on this Blu-ray release.Overall, "Santa Claus Conquers the Martians" is known to be a bad film but I have seen way worse films than this and dare I say, I'm always entertained by this film because of its far-out nature
 But for parents, this is probably a holiday film that you want to show your young children as they won't question the low production values or its crazy storyline.And the film is enjoyed  by its fans because it has become this annual Christmas favorite for some because of its Christmas sci-fi nature and uber-kitschiness

 So, for those who grew up watching this film will probably want to own it on Blu-ray

 If you are a fan of the film, this Blu-ray is for you!

$REVIEW.: HBO must once again be commended for a movie as unexpected and as pleasurable as any seen in recent months, on the big screen or on TV. There is enough in the inspired Sarandon-Fiennes performances to recommend it, in the apt and character-driven dialogue which make this more than your conventional TV bio. There is also Bob Balaban's knowledgeable direction, as well as the choice soundtrack which - both in the jazz instrumentals as in the (unfamiliar-to-me) Peggy Lee: 'I Love the Way You're Breaking My Heart' - becomes as revealing of the characters as does the narrative itself.Given the expediencies of movie industry, 'Bernard and Doris' regrettably went directly to television. It is unfortunate that many like myself can expect to experience these treasures only by chancing upon them while surfing through cable.

$REVIEW.: Audition was my introduction to &#34;Asia Extreme Tartan&#34; and Asian horror.  Good one to start with, right?  Well for me it was.For some people this movie will move &#34;too slow&#34;.  those those people I would say that you probably won't/don't enjoy some of the better &#34;horror&#34; films from Japan/S. Korea/Thailand because Asian &#34;horror&#34; tends to be more psychological and slower paced.  They're not the go for the gore from the start type of movies - usually.  I'm not talking the real extreme stuff (ex: Guinea Pig, which NO I haven't watched, even I have limits).  I'm talking more like A Tale of Two Sisters, Kairo, Ringu (not to be confused with the very cool FX but completely different story The Ring).Watch this movie closely - the slow parts.  You might want to watch it more than once to pick up on some of the more subtle nuances ex: Shigeharu Aoyama turning his wife's picture around, for instance - there are reasons for just about everything in this movie.  Some won't make sense, especially to the normal Western mindset.  Like, why did Asami Yamazaki allow the branding and other abuses?The last half hour?  Oh, it's ON!  Now, you will need to have a bit of a strong stomach and yeah, probably a bit of a twisted sense of humor for one specific thing (the window &#34;splat&#34; cracked me up).  Yes, Asami is very, very, very, VERY disturbed.  That's why you need to pay attention to the rest of the movie and be patient - take in as much as you can to try to get into Asami's head even a little.I will say, it's been noted that Rob Zombie found this difficult to watch (really?!), so if you're squeamish this probably isn't for you.  If you're impatient or only like fast-paced films, this probably isn't for you.

$review_text.: This is not a Sherlock Holmes movie, but it is a top-pick for any Sherlock Holmes fan. In fact, I would go as far as saying it is the best Sherlock Holmes movie I ever saw, even though Holmes is hardly mentioned.Basically, the movie shows the early life of A.C. Doyle, the author of Sherlock Holmes, who apparently met a professor at the university that inspired him to write his novels. This movie shows a case Doyle and Dr. Bell solved and clearly, it is a story one could describe as a "best of Sherlock Holmes". Apparently it is based on fact. Whether that is true or not, I do not know.This movie represents what I like best about Sherlock Holmes and it in many way is what I wanted other Sherlock Holmes movies to be.

$REVIEW.: Matt (Matthew Wilson) is a young gay man who works in a comic store.  He's fresh out of a six year failed relationship, and having problems finding someone new.  He commiserates with his longtime best friend, yoga instructor Jenn (Jenn Harris), who is also lonely, and suggests that they have a baby together.  Matt is open to the idea, but a bit stunned when Jenn vetoes the "turkey baster" method, and insists they conceive the "old fashioned way."  Uh, huh.Their initial attempts make for some rather amusing almost-slapstick laughs.  But neither anticipated it would take months of such attempts, which made it a bit difficult to date others on the side, while "saving themselves" for each other. When they compromise and decide to try do-it-yourself artificial insemination, Matt's campy friend Nelson (actually, the film's writer/director, Jonathan Lisecki, in a scene-stealing role), offers his assistance, since he went through the same process with a lesbian friend. At the same time, both Matt and Jenn find too-hot-to-wait lovers, leading to some guilt feelings and possible regrets.This is a very funny, somewhat over-the-top comedy, with excellent acting and direction.  Appropriate for mixed gay/straight audiences, and definitely a positive outlook on the concept of gay parenting as well as supportive straight allies.  Won several awards at gay and regional film fests,and nominee for a 2013 Independent Spirit Award.  Not rated, but would be a light R for sexual content, although there is no nudity.  DVD extras include a short subject on which the full-length film is based, as well as several deleted scenes (Don't miss checking out the one with Jenn and "Logan.")  Five stars out of five!

So I watched it and when it was done I had to get on Amazon and buy it to see the whole thing it was truly amazing. I can't say for sure how close to real life it is but it sure seemed to have feeling and heart in what I had seen and makes you really feel for the charactors in the story. A walk through the days of a team of bomb deacrivators stationed in Iraq during the war.

$REVIEW.: Volume Three is a distinct improvement over volume two


 "Leviathans" has more action, more plot progression, and more character development

 Some secrets are revealed, one about Nigel and one about Mackey; but I won't spoil them

 Romantic tension builds between Nene and Mackey


 It's cute, you know?  I hope it can work out for them!  I will not forgive the series creators if they just let Nene and Mackey's interest in each other drop.Nene is getting on Priss' nerves because Nene is being reckless during battles
 Priss even asks Sylia to let Nene go!  Wow, that is gall


 You will have to watch to see what happens

 In a more introspective moment, Lina returns to her hometown in the country, where she has an arranged date with a surprisingly handsome and understanding young man

 Again, I hope to see more of these two together.Genom is messing with both military and bio-mechanics in this volume


 There is a huge, disturbing creature eating Boomers that do work deep underground

 And a huge military Boomer wreaks havoc in the city
 With the appearances of these two Leviathans, Leon and his partner Daley begin to suspect something is up with Genom - and they take investigative steps
 Will discovery of the Knight Sabers' identities be far behind?This DVD has four episodes, #9-12
 They are:9

My Nation Underground10


Woke Up With a Monster11
Sheer Heart Attack12


Made in JapanAs far as extras, there are none

 It is disappointing to see that there are only three character profiles in the "extras."

$review_text.: Some kids pull a prank on Tamara and she winds up dead, comes back from the grave all [...]-looking and sporting supernatural powers.  Boredom and lots of lifeless acting ensue.The acting in this is some of the worst I've seen, and I watch a whole lot of these low budget horror movies.  Nobody has any actual personality whatsoever, they've all got an "attitude", and that's pretty much the entire breadth and width of their performances.  I couldn't care less if they all lived or died.  This keeps the interest level at precisely zero, and that's about all I've got to say about this stinky waste of time.5

$review_text.: I've been told on many occasions that Sweet Sweetback's Baadassss Song was one of the most groundbreaking, revolutionary films during the blaxploitation era.  I've also read that it was one of the most important black films of all time.  Hey, it came out long before I was born, so I had no idea what these people were talking about.  I had to see it for myself.While all three points are neglibile, this movie is horrible.There's hardly any dialouge, the main character lacks any kind of depth.  In fact, the main character says only a few words in the entire film.  The movie consists of him running "from the man," overpowering "the man," and f****** himself out of every situation.  The only thing he's got going for him is having some "sweetback."  As a man, I found the notion that he can f*** his way out of his problems disgusting and unrealistic.  I'm not saying this as some kind of moralist.  I love reading and writing noir fiction.  I love cheesy movies and even cheesier noir, but I hate this movie.  If that wasn't enough, the psychadelic cinematography was blurry, grainy and shaky.  In fact, 2/3 rds of the movie consists of unnecessary scenes that have nothing to do with the movie.The only thing I can agree with is that this film was the most important indie film of all time.  Not black, because its bigger than being a black film.  My reason?  Because without Sweet Sweetback's Baadassss Song making money, none of the much better indie films get made over the past 40+ years, regardless of genre.Anyone who knows me knows that in order for me to assign anything one-star, its got to be very, very, very, very bad.

$review_text.: Usually, the longer a film franchise carries on, the more diluted it becomes - eventually leading to recasts, reboots, and whatever other attempt movie studios can think of to preserve their moneymakers.  Just a few of the franchises that have had to reinvent themselves over the years includes James Bond, Batman, and basically any of the popular horror series.  Outside of the horror genre, most of the series additions these days are above average or at least average in terms of quality, with The Dark Knight and Skyfall being a few of the best examples, compared to Batman & Robin and Die Another Day being examples of their polar opposites.  Now, let's turn our attention to the Fast & Furious franchise.  After the release of The Fast and the Furious (2001), the franchise clearly took a tumble without Vin Diesel in the driver's seat, spawning two mediocre (yet successful) sequels before "rebooting" with the original cast in Fast & Furious and Fast Five.  The majority of that cast returns once again in the fifth sequel, Fast & Furious 6.Directed by Justin Lin (Fast & Furious, Fast Five), Fast & Furious 6 stars Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto, along with Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner - reunited once again when Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) approaches them for help to take down a rival crew, run by Owen Shaw (Luke Evans).  Shaw's crew also includes Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez), Dom's former girlfriend that was allegedly killed while assisting the FBI - who has been suffering from amnesia since her supposed fatal car accident.  With official pardons being used as collateral to clear their names, Toretto, O'Conner, and the rest of their crew must assist Hobbs in stopping Shaw and his crew from stealing components to assemble a devastating weapon that would have the ability to knock out electronically crash an entire region.  Jordana Brewster, Gina Carano, Sung Kang, Gal Gadot, Chris "Ludacris" Bridges, and Tyrese Gibson also star in supporting roles.After the conclusion of Tokyo Drift, it would have been hard to imagine the Fast & Furious franchise surviving long enough to make another film - but here we are, three sequels later with another on the way in 2014.  To be honest, Fast & Furious (2009) didn't have a whole lot going for it other than it reunited the original cast, but it was enough of a commercial success to spawn Fast Five, which is by far and away the best film of the franchise.  With that being said, it was always going to be a massive undertaking to exceed the entertainment value of Fast Five.  However, Fast & Furious 6 definitely gives Fast Five a run for its money - due in large part to the addition of another crew that is just as talented as Toretto's crew, not to mention the return of Michelle Rodriguez.Fast & Furious 6 is basically split down the center with two different plots coinciding with one another, the first being the crew assisting Hobbs to take down the Shaw gang, and the second to return Michelle Rodriguez's character to her once prominent position as one of the franchise's main characters.  The Letty storyline is a bit silly when you really think about it, but then again the whole franchise is pretty silly in itself - since basically all of the characters should either be dead or in jail.  Still, the storyline works enough to get Rodriguez back in the mix and to be completely honest, the franchise was really lacking the role of a dominant female that Gal Gadot and Elsa Pataky had been desperately trying to fulfill in the past two sequels.  Now that Letty is back in full swing, ***SPOILER - it should be no surprise to see that Gadot and Pataky were essentially written out of the franchise by the conclusion of Fast Six***It's not as though the Fast & Furious films are overly impressive with the overall quality of acting or meaningful dramatization (they star Vin Diesel and Paul Walker for cryin' out loud), so it shouldn't be too surprising that these films have taken on a watered-down, soap opera-ish feel to them.  Regardless, viewers are obviously invested in these characters, clearly having fallen in love with them and continuing to want to know what happens to them.  At the same time, you have to wonder how long these films can keep going at the rate they are progressing - because no matter how many times a character says their predicament presents "another level" of difficulty, it still feels the same as the last film.  That's not to say these films aren't exciting, because they absolutely are, but the more action these films dish out, the harder it will be to get to the finish line the next time around.The best part of these films (outside of the cars) is waiting to see in what direction the story will be taken next.  Like the popular Marvel films, the Fast & Furious franchise has adopted the "scene after the credits" to help set up the lead-in for the next film.  For example, Fast & Furious was a direct lead-in to Fast Five, while Fast Five's ending saw the return of Eva Mendes to drop the bombshell about Letty still being alive - and well, Tokyo Drift supposedly taking place out of order is just plain strange (especially since viewers already know the ultimate fate of Han).  How does Fast & Furious 6 end?  Well, you'll have to go to the theater to get the answer to that question, but let's just say a HUGE A-list actor will be taking the reins in Fast 7 as the main villain.  This scene also ties up a MAJOR loose end from Tokyo Drift that wasn't even a loose end at the time.  Sound confusing?  Well, go watch the film and ask questions after.Overall, Fast & Furious 6 is a terrific addition to the franchise, featuring no shortage of big engines, big thrills - and a rather large tank.  Team Torreto continues to hit on all cylinders and will easily cross the finish line at the box office with another victory under their belt - paving the way for next year's sequel (which everyone will be clamoring about after the final scene of the film).  Feel free to buy your tickets in advance, because Fast & Furious 6 is a MUST SEE.Overall Grade - BFNDNreview.com

$review_text.: I bought this collection mainly in hopes of swashbuckling action, scenes of medieval times, etc
 Well, there are scenes of medieval times, but swashbuckling action, not so much
 There are some battle scenes, and even the occasional sword fight, but if you are looking for a film in the style of The Mark of Zorro, none of these films measure up

 Mostly they are historical dramas with aspects of adventure tales.The collection is not entirely a disappointment, however

 Three of the films are in color and the photography is beautiful; the music, too, is also beautiful


 Tyrone Power's acting is -- well, just what you'd expect from Tyrone Power in historical or adventure films

 He's a reasonably good actor and carries each picture quite well.If you're a fan of old films, and love seeing your favorite character actors, you'll enjoy this set

 For example, Blood and Sand can boast supporting actors such as Anthony Quinn, J


Carroll Naish, Laird Cregar, John Carradine, and even George (Superman) Reeves in one of his earlier roles


 Son of Fury has Elsa Lanchester (who is wonderful in her part), Dudley Digges, Roddy McDowall, Harry Davenport, and Carradine again (in a better role than in the previous picture)
 The Captain from Castile has Cesar Romero (if you look closely, you can see the contours of the Joker's face!) as a charming (if dubiously historical) conquistador Cortez, and also, in an unusual role for him, Lee J

Cobb, as well as George Zucco


 Prince of Foxes has Orson Welles as a wonderfully cynical and scheming Cesare Borgia, and wonderful performances by Felix Aylmer and Everett Sloane, with a good bit part by Eduardo Ciannelli


 The Black Rose has Finlay Currie, Jack Hawkins, and Michael Rennie, with bit parts by a young Laurence Harvey and Herbert Lom.If you are a historian, and think that historical films should make at least some slight effort to be accurate, you will hate many of these films

 The portrait of Muslims, Mongols, and medieval China in The Black Rose makes Cecil B

DeMille's historical epics (often criticized for being more Hollywood than history) look like precise scholarly treatises by comparison


 There are deformations of various kinds in all the historical material in these films.More serious than the historical inaccuracy are the weak scripts

 The scripts from The Black Rose and The Captain from Castile are abominable; the plots aren't very good or coherent, and the dialogue is often weak as well.The best film, in my view, is Prince of Foxes, which, while doubtless deforming Renaissance Italian history to some degree, is closer to the spirit of Renaissance political life than, say, The Black Rose is to the ethos of medieval Asia

 Much of Prince of Foxes was shot on location in Italy, and I deeply regret that Fox decided that color film would be too expensive


 The film still looks good in black and white; it would have been magnificent in color, and I would rather have seen those real Italian castles and Renaissance battle-scenes in color that than, say, The Captain from Castile, which is pretty much romantic fluff.There are plenty of extras in this set, including commentaries on two of the five films (unfortunately none on Prince of Foxes, the best of the films), and a number of features on the life and career of Tyrone Power, including interviews with some of his later leading ladies and some of his surviving wives and children, and a short news clip of his marriage in Italy to actress Linda Christian (later to play the first Bond girl in the 1-hour television version of Casino Royale in the 1950s)
 If you are into collecting scraps of video about Tyrone Power, then you will probably want this set.There are also four black-and-white postcard-size stills from the films in each DVD case.Each of the five films has its own DVD case, and the set is in a cardboard slipcase
 I had no problems playing any of the DVDs on my standards DVD/VHS player, so I cannot confirm reports elsewhere here of skips and freezes.This collection would probably be called a must-have for Tyrone Power devotees; it is a &#34;nice to have, if not essential&#34; collection for those who enjoy 1940s films generally, like Power well enough, and enjoy beautifully photographed historical dramas with good musical scores

 In my view, the best film is Prince of Foxes, with its great performance by all actors, including Welles (Welles's performance in Black Rose is less memorable, largely because of the lousy script and incoherent plot), but Son of Fury has much to recommend it (a featured role for Frances Farmer, and a wonderful early appearance by Gene Tierney, and a good plot, with a suitably villainous George Sanders, Powers's nemesis from The Black Swan)
 Unfortunately Son of Fury is only in black and white
 Blood and Sand is pretty good as well

 I don't know if it matches up with the silent original, which I haven't seen, but it has its moments, with Linda Darnell as the good wife and Rita Hayworth as the temptress who lures Power into wickedness, and a wonderful Vincent Price-like turn by Laird Cregar, an underrated actor who produced some very good work in his short, 5-year career

 I'd give the movies about 3.5 stars (8 out of 10 for Prince of Foxes and Son of Fury, the two black and white films, and somewhere between 7 and 7.5 out of 10 for each of the three color films), but the collection is so nicely done (good DVD quality and extras) that I'd give the whole package 4 stars.

$review_text.: I thoroughly enjoyed watching EULOGY, a dark comedy about a family who is reunited when the male patriarch of the family passes away.  To be honest, when I saw the cast and the well-trodden plot description, I was not expecting anything stellar.  But the film exceeded my expectations and manages to find some breathing room and originality in its short 91 minutes.  The plot of EULOGY, as every reviewer has described, is not complex.  Director Michael Clancy manages to pull you into the dysfunctional lives of these characters and let you be a fly on the wall to their hilarious and ridiculous fights.One interesting aspect of the film is its treatment of death.  You don't always expect to have any serious message coming from a comedy, but EULOGY has one.  While everyone has come to this funeral on the pretense of mourning their father, the occasion becomes a time for them all to mourn their own lives and failures.  It is a natural message enough: obviously, a death in the family makes one painfully aware of one's own mortality.  However, there is something added in this film.  No one seems to be truly sorry to see the old man go, except the granddaughter who seems to have a distorted view of him.  Perhaps, the fact that they have all gathered to "honor" the death of a man they did not openly love forces them to realize the lack of love and connection they have in their own lives.  Will we be mourned at the end of our lives?Now, I am not trying to sift EULOGY for some deep meaning or message.  But hidden behind all of the comedy and the hilarious (and absurd) dialogue, there is some real emotion to be had in these scenes.  Having not expected any, I was surprised and pleased by the end result.  My only major criticism of the film is the forced love story between the granddaughter and an old fling of hers.  It seems tacked onto the film unnaturally and serves only to snap the teenager out of her false world of mourning to join the rest of her family.  If you have the opportunity to see it, I would highly recommend this film to you.

$review_text.: Watching the adorable Whiskers Meerkat family in the wild is both heartwarming and heartbreaking at times. No animal lover could resist the sight of these beautiful meerkats. Their human-like qualities are touching and endearing. These small animals form a strong family bond and fight to the death to protect their own. Flower is the matriarch of this family and she can banish a member for any reason as she did with her poor daughter Tosca. Their lives are full of fun and danger. Each day is a new adventure and it is a pure delight to watch this series. It is amazing at how the daily routine of these small animals are captured in incredible detail. I thoroughly enjoyed Season One and was left wanting more. Each episode is rather short and spends time with information on the previous and next episodes along with the constant explanation of the University of Cambridge's 10 year study on the meerkats. It's impossible to watch one episode right after the other since the DVD menu is not set up with the option to play all episodes. Hit menu and you will be taken to the menu for the episode you just watched. Moving on to the next episode takes several steps. I also think the blank pauses where the commericials would have been inserted could have been left out. With countless hours of meerkat adventures to include the episodes could have been expanded with more footage. Despite these technical issues, MEERKAT MANOR is a pure joy to watch. You won't be able to resist falling in love with them.

$REVIEW.: Desperate men caught in a desperate struggle. This film should be viewed with the others depicting the dark early days of our strugle in the Pacific, "They Were Expendable", "Air Force" and "Wake Island". Of the four mentioned, "Bataan" ranks only behind "They Were Expendable" in my book for giving you a portrait of men who are doomed, and KNOW they're doomed, but choose to fight on regardless. This film may qualify as propaganda but barely so. Not overly flattering to their Japanese opponents but not as racist a exercise as "Air Force".  Still you see plenty of atrocities to make the blood boil. What makes this film stand out above other's of its time and ilk was the multi-racial make up of the cast and graphic nature of the violence.In this film you see a man almost beheaded with a samurai sword, another crucified, you see someone machine gunned and the bullet holes are still smoking when he drops. Grim, depressing and sad but strangely uplifting because you know that the Japanese miscalculated and will pay the inevitable price. A tribute to all the un-sung fallen who died in a million jungle hell holes with no one to mark their graves.Da Worfster

But Dreamworks has reached a new level of awesome with Megamind.The movie is not only hilarious and entertaining, but it also has a lot of emotion


There are scenes where you really feel for the main character
You relate to him, everyone can relate to being pushed into becoming something you didn't want to be


All the characters are strong and not annoying at all
The action is superb, and I am so getting this on Blu-Ray because the animation is just great! You can tell Dreamworks has come a long way since Shrek
The relationship between Megamind and Roxanne (the female lead) is funny and sweet at the same time

I love everything about this movie, and I don't think I can find anything wrong with it if I tried

Critics may say it's predicable and cliched, but there are a few twists thrown in that even I didn't expect


This movie, like Megamind, is something special :)The lesson "Choose your own Destiny" shines through in this movie, and it's great for both kids and adults

I would definitely by the Blu-Ray dvd (comes with a mini movie and a ton of extras) or at least buy the single disc


This movie is just great, and everyone who loves animated movies, superhero movies, or just loves having a good time will love this movie.Good job Dreamworks, keep it up! (and if it's possible, PLEASE make a sequel!)

$review_text.: A great Blu Ray release. Sound and picture is excellent. Didn't notice any Digital Noise or sound dropping during scenes. A great looking movie to show off the power of your HD TV and Surround Sound system. Even if you don't have those, the Special Features are more than worth the buy. They don't just feature everybody patting each other on the back, but really get into the meat of how this Movie was made.Regarding the movie, as a movie (!), I found it to be one of the most entertaining of the series. As an adaptation, however, I'll say its sorely lacking, which brings me to a slight feeling of disappointment regarding its length. It could've been a better adaptation. This isn't to say its a bad adaptation, but to say it could've definitely been better, which brings me to something I feel should be addressed: the notion of an Extended Cut of the film.The Extended Cut doesn't exist, folks, or at least not the one you're looking for. I've read the screenplay (The Shooting Script), and with the exception of a scene in Professor Trelawney's classroom, which was filmed and is included as a Deleted Scene here, and Professor McGonagall's Stunning Spell scenes (which, as written, were completely over the top and might've killed the overall tone of the film), there is nothing else to add save for a bunch of scenes that would be remarkably hindering of the film's pacing (like Harry skipping stones or the Threstrals scene with Hagrid). The film is actually better than the script, as Director David Yates, together with Mark Day, improved on the film's pacing by shortening some scenes, jump cutting (like during the climax and during Harry's dreams/premonitions) and using newspaper montages. That supposed 40 minutes of cut-footage? Outside of maybe 20 minutes of Deleted Scenes which wouldn't add anything, it was cut FOOTAGE. Alternate takes, unused coverage, and cut lines- the stuff that proves useless in making a movie better, and can in fact make a movie worse (The Director's Cut of The Chronicles of Riddick). Its like that one famous unused shot from The Dark Knight showing Heath Ledger as The Joker cackling on the school bus while the Hospital blows up outside of the bus windows = completely unnecessary.The Extended Cuts that certain people are looking for in the series couldn't exist, anyways. After all, Rowling's books were still being released when the films were, and she famously refused to cue in Steve Kloves and the directors on where the series was headed, given her fear that they may spoil important plot points of later books before their release. The only films in the series that could've had proper Extended Cuts are The Half-Blood Prince and The Deathly Hallows, and rather than do that, David Yates set about finishing the series as its own separate being from the books (including things like Flying Death Eaters, the burning Weasley home, and the like). There still could be solid Extended Cuts of those films, but those probably wouldn't improve the films as better adaptations.Sorry I spent so much time on that aspect, but it needed to be addressed, and badly, seeing the many comments and reviews trashing The Ultimate Editions of the films over the lack of Extended Cuts. If you're a complete Potter Movie nut, this is the set to buy. Your Blu Ray player will thank you.

While the characterization isn't' all that deep, there's something haunting about being dumped into this world.

$review_text.: If you would like to watch a period film with nice production values, one or two good actors, and a plot reminiscent of Jane Austen's novel "Emma," you might be interested in this BBC offering


 If you would actually like to see a film of the novel "Emma," I suggest either of the two 1999 Emmas, with either Gwneth Paltrow or Kate Beckinsale as the heroine.Not recommended for those who value faithfulness to the spirit of the novel.

$REVIEW.: Let me begin by saying that I'm a BIG Amanda Bynes fan so the possibility of me disliking anything she's in is next to impossible. Now to the matter at hand, the '07 film `Sydney White' is Amanda doing what she does best; starting off on a new adventure on her own (this time going away to college), falling in love with campus the hottie (Matt Long), battling his ex-girlfriend and resident sorority b*t*h (Sara Paxton) and almost single-handedly changing the inequities of university social life. That girl can do just about anything!There's not a lot new here (OK nothing) in terms of storyline but the production values are excellent and the cast outstanding. All that and Amanda too! What more could anyone ask for?My Rating: -3  Stars-.

$review_text.: When I first heard of this movie and what my friends thought of it, I was looking forward to seing Antonio Banderas again with his guitar playing and his &quot;loaded&quot; guitar.  I got even more excited when I found out that Johnny Depp was in this movie.  I read a review of this movie in an Entertainment Weekly magazine and they were telling me how Johnny Depp &quot;steals the show&quot; in this movie as a corrupt CIA agent.  Once I saw the movie, however, I was very dissapointed...I was looking forward to being BLOWN AWAY by Johnny Depp's performance.  I felt that he really had no BIG part in the movie...and he DIED.  Antonio Banderas hardly talked in the movie, except for his flashbacks with Salma Hayek...which brings me to another point...Same Hayek should've been at the very end of the cast credits (Ex. With Willem Dafoe AND Salma Hayek)...all Antonio did was do all the fake, Hollywood action sequences.  Willem Dafoe was -surprisingly- a good Mexican in the movie.  The only actor who should receive credit in the movie, was the retired cop who was investigating after talking to Depp.  Overall, I would have to say, if I was an interviewer, that Once Upon A Time In Mexico was a FLOP for Robert Rodriguez, Thumbs Down, and that Desperado was ACE all by itself until this movie came out.  That's my reviewThankyou

$review_text.: In Hollywood, directors get the credit. With The Chase, a strange, fascinating, neurotic noir, the credit should go to one of the masters of noir pulp fiction, the writer Cornell Woolrich. Like Phantom Lady, another Woolrich creation, the story centers around what might be struggling to get out of a person's head.Woolrich wrote masterful pulp using his own name or the pseudonyms William Irish or George Hopley. He was a homosexual who loathed himself. He married a girl he idolized and saw the marriage annulled. Despite the money he made, he lived most of his life with his mother in decaying New York apartment buildings where his neighbors were lushes, prostitutes and drug addicts. At night, he'd troll the waterfront for anonymous sex partners. He became a deep alcoholic. And he turned out a stream of mystery novels and short stories that still are worth reading nearly 40 years after his death. Much of his material has been made into movies. If you like Hitchcock's Rear Window, you're watching a Cornell Woolrich short story. More often than not, the stories revolve around the black struggles that can happen inside a person's head. The Chase, based on Woolrich's The Black Path of Fear, is a noir worth watching.One morning a down-and-out young man, Chuck Scott (Robert Cummings), finds a wallet on a Miami sidewalk. He finds the owner's name and address and delivers it to him. The owner, Eddie Roman (Steve Cochran), is a soft-spoken gangster with a penchant for hitting women, eliminating business competitors and for always being the man in control. His partner, Gino (Peter Lorre), who grew up with him, is just as ruthless and amoral, but not as psychopathic. Roman has been married three years to Lorna (Michelle Morgan), a beautiful, frightened woman who wants only to escape from him. Eddie Roman is amused by Chuck Scott's honesty and hires him as a chauffeur. Scott quickly learns two things. First, Roman has a car that is built so that from the back seat Roman can take over the accelerator. When he flips a switch he can move the car up to over 100 miles an hour. The driver can only steer and pray. The second thing Scott learns is that he is drawn to Lorna Roman.It all comes together when Scott agrees to flee with Lorna to Havana. And then we descend into a dark swirl of murder, pay back, amnesia and fear. Half way through the movie we find ourselves in a paranoid dream of night-time Havana, of a horse-drawn carriage that rides off into a busy street, of a man glimpsed throwing a knife in a crowded bar, of a Cuban detective who casually uses a murder knife to spear a piece of melon from the table of a sobbing prostitute. Only later do we learn what is dream and what is real. If what was dream is frightening, what is real may turn out to be worse.This really is an excellently developed story, and photographed with all the poorly lit streets and shadowy rooms a good noir needs. Cummings does a credible job as the uncertain but determined hero. Steve Cochran is first-rate as the menace. He's quiet, even thoughtful, but ready to do violent and unpredictable things in an instant. He has no intention of letting Lorna go. Lloyd Corrigan, a long time character actor, makes a memorable appearance as a businessman who won't sell his ships to Roman. He spends the rest of his life, which is brief, in Roman's wine cellar with a large dog. The music score is a strange dreamy underlay that suits the movie just fine.This Alpha Video DVD, unfortunately, is barely watchable. The picture is soft, dark and full of scratches. The audio is not much better. There are no extras and only six chapter stops. This is an interesting, effective noir which deserves better treatment.

$REVIEW.: Though the original FRANKENSTEIN is not particularly scary to a modern viewer and is more inspired by Mary Shelley's groundbreaking gothic novel than true to it this classic film is still very worth seeing.  Boris Karloff has no dialogue beyond a growl as the monster yet with marvelous makeup and expressive eyes we actually find sympathy with Frankenstein's poor addled creation.  Karloff's portrayal and its clones are the monster we envision when we hear the word Frankenstein.  The scene with Maria (the little girl playing with the daisies) is restored to what director Whale originally intended and in this context we see the incident as a pathetic accident rather than just a mindless killing.  I kept waiting for the scene with the monster and the blind man but that occurs in the also worthy sequel BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN.  This is a short film of a little more than an hour and a must see for anyone interested in the history of film or the horror genre.

$review_text.: I'm a big fan of dinosaurs since I was little, so  I found this series to be really cool.  I liked the graphics it made me say &quot;Woah! &quot; a few times.  The DVD version is sold in two disks and the second disk is the  making of &quot;Walking With the Dinosaurs&quot;.  It is really neat to see  how they made this, and they put some additional dino animation which I  thought was clever and funny.  The first disk has a cute menu screen and it  presents the dinosaurs and other animals in the land, sea, and air during  three different time periods.  Although I have a problem with the theory  that dinosaurs lived millions of years ago, I do dismiss this because it is  the popular view point and the series is based on the 'popular theory'.  Anyway, I do have to admit that the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; dinosaurs  seemed more real to me than the dinosaurs in this presentation, but I still  liked it and would recommend it to anyone interested in walking with the  dinosaurs.

Anyway, it probably was an intelligent science fiction piece back when it was made, but this would not have been made today.  All the optimism of man's ability for goodness would not have been filmed this way today and the notion that if you get rid of an evil ruler, all will be good is laughable.  If you get rid of en evil dictator in an oppressed country, another will take his place. I did like the film overall but it is just too dated to really be really enjoyable. Back in the late fifties, this would have been great stuff.

Lewis Black is incredibly good at being funny with or without dirty words. What makes Lewis Black funny is the ranty, crushing wit he brings. Granted, he's funny when he curses a lot.

$review_text.: This story started off really well, and is in many parts more faithful to the book than the first Flowers movie. Ellen Burstyn did a great job as Olivia, and at first I was thrilled with this movie.I would expect that some things be cut out of the book to fit the movie's time limit, but I was angry that important plot points were changed. In the book, when Olivia puts tar in Cathy's hair, Chris uses his chemistry kit to remove the tar. In the movie Cathy's hair gets cut. What was even the point of including this scene if you were just going to change it? Better to leave it out!!!Some people didn't like Heather Graham's portrayal of Corrine. Personally I was cool with it. Olivia in this movie is a bit kinder/gentler than the book, which I was okay with. What I was NOT ok with was that Malcolm Foxworth - the reason the family is so screwed up - was not a villain at all in this movie. In the book, even though the children never meet him face to face, Chris and Cathy glimpse him at the Christmas party (after being hidden by their mother who used to hide in the same spot) Malcolm looks up and smiles evilly, showing that he knows of their existence. In the movie, Chris and Cathy hide, and Grandmother is aware of them, but not Grandfather.Since the movie failed to convey Malcolm's evil at all, the story lost some of its punch because Malcolm is a huge catalyst in the Foxworth saga. If the movie had illustrated how evil Malcolm could be, then Burstyn's portrayal of Olivia would have been balanced out, but without Malcolm's influence, there isn't much reason for Olivia to be gentler than she was in the book.The ending? Oy vey! The first movie had a totally messed up and different ending. This movie was closer to the book, but still rife with completely unneccessary changes that were too different from the book. Why did people even bother to make this movie if they were just going to mess around with vital elements of the book!

$review_text.: This family road movie is more about the journey than the destination. Filled with amazing actors and a subtly moving plot, 'Arcadia' is one step ahead of most independent films.Tom (Academy Award nominated actor John Hawkes; &#34;The Sessions&#34;, &#34;Winter's Bone&#34;) plays the father who abruptly gathers his three children into an old station wagon to travel from New England to Arcadia, California.Tom has a new job and Mom won't be joining them until later, adding to the mystery. Eldest sister, Caroline (Kendall Toole in a breakout performance) is joined by moody, middle daughter Greta (played with explosive calmness by Ryan Simpkins - (&#34;Revolutionary Road&#34; and &#34;Surveillance&#34;, which gave her a Best Actress award at the NYC Film Festival - the first child to ever win). The youngest member of the family is Ty Simpkins (&#34;Iron Man 3&#34; and Ryan's real little brother).The journey is full of Tom filling the time exalting an assortment of wild stories, assurances and a great new life. Caroline is slightly removed, having just left her boyfriend behind. Greta is a quietly smoldering pre-teen having her own personal issues and Nat is the young innocent observer. Tom's moods are unexplainable and disturbing, frequently trapping his three children in dangerous and confusing situations.Although a low budget film that doesn't make an effort to make the cross country scenery seem like anything other than southern California, it focuses on a strong and sophisticated plot.Director Olivia Silver does a wonderfully balanced and painful job of story-telling. She presents each family member collectively and individually, reacting to sometimes frightening and all too real situations. As an American family situation, this portrayal suggests it is all too common. This film was supplied by Film Movement for review.

$review_text.: Attack Of The Cybermen: the sixth Doctor's second TV story and the first story of actor Colin Baker's  first full season as the Doctor


Since it was first aired in 1985, the timing of the story (just weeks before the show was put hiatus by the BBC) as well as fans looking at the story itself in terms of its performances, production values and script has made it one of the most discussed stories of the old series

What are we to make of the story then?The quality of the performances are varied at best
Colin Baker was still settling into the role of the Doctor and was still being played as an irascible and at times downright unlikeable, something that hampers the story as it makes it hard to sympathize with the Doctor


Nicola Bryant seems to still be finding her feet as well, which doesn't do the story any favors either
The supporting cast fares a bit better particularity Maurice Colbourne's Lytton and the excellent double act of Jonathan David and Michael Atwell as the Cybermen's prisoners Stratton and Bates (though they actually do exceedingly little in the actual story)


Others such as the various actresses playing Cryons and Michael Kilgarrif's Cyber-Controller don't comes across anywhere near as well thanks to their costumes and the script (the latter also affecting Brian Glover as Griffiths).As a production, it's adequate at best
The largely Earthbound first episode comes across the best with some good location work and some good sewer sets
When the story leaves Earth, it runs into trouble


Despite attempts by director Matthew Robinson and his cameramen to make Telos look interesting, it comes across as a dull quarry (which is exactly what it was)

The Cybermen's base and tombs come across as being dull and cheap, something made even more surprising since this was the first story of the season and there was certainly a bit more money to spend on the production


The music of Malcom Clarke also varies greatly in quality from effective (such as the Cybermen theme he reprises from his own Earthshock score) to wildly inappropriate (the odd, almost humorous pieces of music used for the robbers and during scenes in part one)
Even at its best the story can't make up for its biggest problem: the script.This story has long been controversial for its use of continuity
The story is heavily based in the Cybermen stories of the past including the destruction of their home-world of Mondas from their debut story The Tenth Planet, the Cybermen using the London sewers from The Invasion as well as the Cyber-Controller and the titular tomb of the Cybermen from the (then missing) 1967 story of the same name
There's also Lytton from the previous year's Resurrection Of The Daleks as well as the TARDIS chameleon circuit (which functions on and off throughout the first episode)


This was to be televised Doctor Who at its most continuity heavy with the result being a tangled skein that it is all but impenetrable to many fans, let along members of the general public


Doctor Who in the mid-1980s has often been criticized for its over reliance on the show's continuity which is something that, when the era is viewing on whole, seems odd until stories like this where its easy to see where that thought came from.And some of the continuity usage seems to be downright cynical as well

John Nathan-Turner hit upon the idea of changing the outside of the TARDIS, ditching the familiar police box shape and mined the notion for all it was worth to publicize the show in the lead up to Attack being broadcast


While that's not necessarily cynical in its own right, spending a chunk of already limited screen time to tell an already over-packed story simply to annoy some fans certainly is.On the flip side of that is the use of elements from Tomb Of The Cybermens from the tombs right up to bringing back a frankly unsuitable Michael Kilgarriff simply because he'd played the part 18 years earlier


It feels as though that what the production team was trying to do was to remake Tomb Of The Cybermen for a generation of fans who (as far as was known in 1984-85) would never get to see it


It was an attempt to please the fans that instead meant that the story served simply as an example of what happens when loose ends and memories of a story thought to be lost forever were forced to fit into a story already too complex for its own good.This story then, like much of the Colin Baker era, is the story of being in the wrong place at the wrong time
Doctor Who's fate was on the line and it needed, perhaps more than it had previously, to be a popular success

What it instead served up was a story that jumbled continuity together, mixed into a story that was made even more complex and the public walked away from it and never came back
Attack Of The Cybermen then wasn't a new beginning..
it was the beginning of the end.

$review_text.: Much better than the first "House of the Dead". This movie proves sequels can be better than the original, even if it isn't that good. I mean, it could NOT get worse than the first one. Contains all the requisite gore and blood of a zombie movie, has a plot and the acting is not horrid. For a TV movie this is a pretty ok effort. Somewhat following what happened in the first movie, a team of special forces (for killing zombies) infiltrates a college campus believed to be ground zero for the zombie virus. Their mission is to obtain a blood sample from patient zero in order to create an antidote. The film explains how the first one ties in to the current story and we even get one of the characters from the first movie (who had allegedly died, guess not).Emmanuelle Vaugier seemed to have created a new acting method: the tired acting. Somehow she always appeared bored and tired, in every scene. Victoria Pratt is always a nice addition to every sci-fi movie and her acting was better than all the other actors. The movie presented situations that proved to defy logic: from being surrounded by zombies and not getting a single scratch, to zombies being electrocuted, yet will not die by a shot in the heart, and finally, the end (without giving it away)...honestly, how does one survive? Still, the movie was entertaining, better than a lot of zombie movies out there. I wouldn't mind watching it again.
$SUMMARY.: Better than the first

This is a good movie with a pretty good script and good older Mel so if you have liked Mel in the past you will certainly enjoy this suspense filled drama I give it a solid 4 stars

$review_text.: I actually first caught this movie on the Lifetime Movie Network, and had never heard of it before that


However, I soon found myself engrossed in it

It's not your typical love story, but that's what is so good about it
Two people meet and slowly fall in love, but there's a big secret that each of them has that they're not sharing with the other that ends up making all the difference in how they relate to each other
By the time you finish watching this movie, you'll have rethought everything about your life and how you're living it, and if you have a significant other, you'll both be brought closer by this story

It's a very powerful love that these two people share, made all the more intense by their situation

This may not be a blockbuster, but I highly recommend that anyone who has ever spent their time whining about how hard they have it pick this up and watch it.

$review_text.: As a long-time LotR fan, I waited for the theater release last Christmas, the DVD release in August and the extended edition release as well


 I love the extended edition, but there may be quite a few people who would prefer the original theater version


 Here are the most significant additions to the extended release: A lenghty sequence near the beginning showing the Shire and more about the Hobbits' lives

 Bilbo is shown beginning his book about his adventures

 Later at the Birthday party he and Frodo have a quiet moment to talk about their relationship

 Jumping ahead to the Moria sequence, there is a lot more footage of the company's journey through the mines


 Finally, the sequence most fans are looking forward to: Galadriel's gifts to the fellowship

 Significantly extended and highlighting the dwarf Gimli's admiration of the Elf Queen.Having said all that, which one is right for you?  Fans seem to come in two catagories


 Those who like the movie very much will want to get the theatrical edition

 It moves along more and fans of this sort will not miss a line or two from the book

The obsessed, like me, treasure every moment of the experience

 Each line is treasured and having them returned to the story enriches it all the more.The added material slows down the pace of the story


 For some this will seem tiresome - you need to get the original DVD
 Don't get the extended version just because it's longer

 For others, this will be like getting thirty more minutes in paradise


 You know what version you need.Hope this is useful
 See you in line for The Two Towers!

$review_text.: by Dane YoussefThe Brat Pack actors are certainly a talented bunch. Everyone has a favorite. For me, it's a toss-up between James Spader and Anthony Michael Hall.John Cusack was mesmerizing back in his early-days. He was a teenager, but he looked, sounded and acted very adult for his age. "The Sure Thing" put him on the map and "Say Anything..." made him a household name.But while Crowe's "Say Anything..." was obviously a great movie, it was both a blessing and a curse for Cusack, who has rarely played anything else in his career. I know, I know. He's been in countless other movies. But "a rose by any other name..." His character, no matter what the movie, is essentially always Lloyd Dobbler.Spader sometimes played other types besides the oily Steff from "Pretty in Pink." His typecast-breaking turn came when he played the lead in this movie.But I know Cusack can do more. I keep waiting for him to. Which was one of my guilty pleasures of this movie.The story and plot are the right out of the old fable about the rich man and the poor man who come together and create something special... and then the rich man betrays the poor man and casts him aside. And the poor man plots to take revenge...Another big twist that "True Colors" has is it's twist in typecasting. Cusack specializes in playing sharp, calculated, smarter-than-average teenager... who's heartbroken and devastated... and is desperately trying to win back the girl. Here, Cusack plays a character who's as smart as the heroes he usually plays, though here he uses his intellectual gifts for evil instead of good. His goal is usually to win the girl's heart. Here he betrays the girl (and his close friend) in order to get what he wants.And Spader usually plays blue-blooded, silver-spoon fed, upper-class yuppie scummy villains. Here he's still a rich blue-blooded yuppie. But a hero, who uses his financial connections to right wrongs and do just.The two meet the first day of law school where there's a fender-bender and brief scuffle. Cusack angrily attacks Spader violently and blames him for the whole thing and the two have to be pulled apart. Later on, things get worse as they discover... their assigned to be roommates. Cusack smooths things over by admitting the whole thing was his fault. You'll see why.Afterwords, the two form a fast friendship and Spader even uses his financial backgrounds and connections to help Cusack out. Later we find out that Cusack is lying about his background to fit in and the payoff feels lifted out of a soppy, moralizing and insipid sit-com where today's moral is... "If you have to be someone else to get a friend, then they're really not your friend."Richard Widmark is great as well as the ailing senator who sees potential and ambition in Cusack after he sees what looks like Cusack doing him a favor, little realizing how dangerous Cusack is. Spader girlfriend considers breaking off the relationship for Cusack who can keep her bringing in big cash. She doesn't realize that Cusack is willing to betray her too, in order to get what he wants.One of the major problems is that their true colors are obvious from the beginning. Cusack is clearly someone not to trust from the start and Spader all but actually walks on water. Another is that the movie is too thin. There isn't enough entry.The movie... skims too much of the surface. And Spader's big plan and the finale is pretty tacked on.The movie aspires to be a movie like "Patriot Games" or "Citizen Kane." But everything is routine and predictable and there are precious few new touches to this tired formula. If screenwriter Kevin Wade could've given the script a bit more depth and discovery into these characters and done a little more with the formula, this could have really been something special. The cast does what it can, but inevitably, a good cast can only take a movie so far. Still, it's worth seeing just for Cusack turn towards the dark side and Spader as a yuppie with heart.Oh, well.by Dane Youssefdanessf@yahoo.com[...]

$REVIEW.: There so are many good things about this movie that I really wish I could write a positive review.  First of all, the animation is great.  On par with Princess Mononoke.  The characters are likeable, with the exception of the sterotypical paranoid government agent.  The story line for the first two thirds of the movie is both funny and touching.  Unfortunately, it goes down hill from there.After throughly enjoying the first two-thirds of movie, my viewing experience was ruined when the later third degenerated into an anti-gun rights, anti-government diatribe.If you want your children indoctrinated into that type of extreme left-wing dogma, then this is the movie for you.  Otherwise, I recommend you skip this one.

 And the  deeper story behind the Agamemnon sequence (easily the sexiest role Sean  Connery ever had.)  You don't have to understand everything the first time  you see it--that's what makes art so enjoyable
 You will find yourself  quoting this movie over and over, things like &quot;I'm not entirely  dim&quot;

$REVIEW.: This was a pretty good movie. It didnt have all the laughs you might expect from the Vaughn/Wilson pairing, but then again, they are older now, and this movie is about a couple middle aged men who are seeking a change from the grind that their lives have become. They basically, through a series of events, decide to enter the Google intern program to try and start a new career with Google. What they find is they are the only interns not in their late teens/early twenties, and their ability to relate to the younger mindset of the other interns and Google itself has suffered by virtue of their middle age. What ensues are funny moments where this comes heavily into play.In a sense, while still a comedy, this move really does a great job of representing how middle age and questionable decisions leading to there can lead to a real mid life crisis, but also gives you the hope of finding a great way for that mid life crisis to be resolved.A definite feel good movie where subtlety trumps quick laughs. I very much enjoyed it.

$review_text.: Back in 2004, I found this at the bargain bin at K-Mart for a mere dollar and thought "This might be a 'so bad it's good' romp to laugh at" and boy was I wrong
 Steel was one of the most torturous cinematic experiences of my life

 I want my dollar back (I'm not kidding).For those of you too young to remember the 90's well enough, here's some history for you
 Back in the early 90's, Shaquille O' Neal was a rising star in the NBA, so much so, he got record deals to record several rap albums, have his own fighting-themed video game called Shaq Fu, and star in his own movies called Kazaam and Steel; all of which are blights to their respective categories

 His rap albums made rap fans scream in agony, Shaq Fu is the rightful whipping boy of video game enthusiasts, and his films are heavily (and rightfully) lambasted by film critics and forgotten by the public

 You know how in some vintage cartoons there would be a witch that would touch a plant and it would die on contact?  It seems like when Shaq touches anything not relating to basketball, it dies on contact

 Given how this cinematic dud still hasn't been released on DVD to this day, I'm certain that it never will since nobody old enough to remember it even remembers it that much.Now to the movie, it's absolutely awful

 The plot is okay, I guess, but given that no one really puts in any effort into their roles, it just makes you want to bash your head on your office desk

 For one, Shaq can't act if his life depended on it
 Of course, he's monotone 95% of the time but when he really does try to put emotion into his lines, it's unbelievably forced

 For example, the scene were army reject Nathaniel Burke (Judd Nelson) fires that soundwave cannon towards the beginning and when John Henry Irons (Shaq) screams out "Nathaniel No!!" is a joke


 Shaq also has the stiffest face in film, when his cop friend gets hurt in the line of duty and when Irons chases down one of the bank robbers armed with one of his high-tech weapons, he supposedly gets "mad" and says "It's on" but you can only tell by his lines and not his face
 Steel is also the most unimpressive superhero ever

 While good superheroes have flaws, Steel is nothing but flaws


 All he does is get shot at and fall like a corpse, not to mention that he's unbelievably slow when he moves


 The other characters aren't impressive at all, either

 For one, the gang members that Burke armed with Steel's weapons are rock stupid

 They break into a giant bank but instead of doing something bearing some semblance to realism by being quiet, they yell like Lil' Jon as they steal the money.While I'm not that hung up on imagery, the Steel costume is atrocious

 When he's threatening that thug  for stealing some stuff from that old, wealthy couple, you can tell when he's talking that his suit is made of rubber

 You'd think they'd at least put some effort in designing a decent costume.While I know that this is a superhero movie and not intended to be 100% realistic, I was quite annoyed by some severely illogical events in the movie
 When Steel confronts one of the bank robbers about where he got that shiny laser gun, the head gang member shoots him in the back with the same type of gun
 That same gun was able to shoot down a helicopter yet when Steel gets shot with it, he doesn't die from the blast, he doesn't even get severe burns from it!!  There's a scene towards the end that contains the worst "Shaq can't make free throws" joke in the movie (more on that later) where Steel and his nephew are trapped with a live grenade but they were able to perform a whole comedy routine before the grenade explodes
 If this had any shred of realism, the grenade would have exploded when Steel shouts "I never make these!!"The humor is awful, just like everything else in this movie

 There's a constant barrage of hammy in-jokes about how Shaq can't shoot free throws that'll have you pulling your hair and groaning in agony

 Of course, the cherry on the s*** sundae has to be when Steel and his nephew get locked in that warehouse and are trapped with an armed grenade and the kid tells him to throw it through a small hole several feet above them, Steel utters "I never make these!!"  Most of the "humorous" lines are blatantly stolen from other people


 Steel's assistant, Susan Sparks, steals "It's not easy being green" from the Muppets and the worst offense has to be when Steel activates his Electro Hammer and blurts out "It's Hammer Time!!"  That right there shows desperation and creative bankruptcy because even back in 1997, MC Hammer was out of style and for this cinematic joke to steal from a horribly outdated musician will surely leave the serious film fan doing the "face palm."  When Steel's Uncle Joe (played by Richard Roundtree) says "I particularly like the shaft" about Steel's hammer, you'll be screaming to yourself "Is this the best they can do?!!"Notice how I rated this 4% and not a 0%, that means there is SOME good in it, right?  Well, yes
 You're about to read my only "glass is half-full" take on this turkey

 The only remotely good parts in this movie were when Sparks attacks some bad guys with some weapons installed on her wheelchair and when Steel successfully makes a free throw with a grenade in that warehouse, one of Burke's henchman makes a pretty funny face as he sees the grenade and screams "No!!," squeezed a little laughter out of me.I hope that there isn't some apologetic, new-found appreciation for this dreck because that's what happened to Howard the Duck and that rotten egg was released on DVD recently


 I hope Steel will NEVER be released on DVD because there's absolutely nothing remarkable about it and worth the waste of plastic to manufacture copies of a movie that NOBODY wants
 Okay, maybe if there was a Riff Trax version of Steel, then it MIGHT be worth having on DVD.You may be wondering what happened to my tape of Steel


 I didn't bother selling it on eBay since I know no one wants this movie, so I did the next best thing, I blew it up with a Furby on the Fourth of July.

$review_text.: As a stand-alone film, the &quot;re-visitation&quot; of Frankenheimer's 1962 classic is quite good. Washington, Shrieber, and Streep acquit themselves admirably in roles previously covered by Sinatra, Harvey, and Lansbury. Kimberly Elise does well in the tremendously altered role of &quot;Rosie&quot;, originally assayed by Janet Leigh. And Jeffrey Wright is on screen briefly, but memorably, as a soldier tormented by the same nightmares that plague Washington and Shrieber.The different elements of plot between the two films are reflective of the times in which they were produced. Demme continues to use his technique of having the actors speak directly into the camera. This adds an eerie touch to the presentation, making the viewer feel as though he is part of the action.There are a few slow passages and the convention hall sequence near the film's end seems protracted.I saw the film with a mixed group, half appearing to have seen the original while the others were totally alien to the classic. The latter had no frame of reference and could possibly appreciate the newer version better.As an owner of the Sinatra film, I found myself comparing and contrasting the two. This may have resulted in my giving the newer movie less than five stars.Lansbury as the first &quot;Mrs. Shaw&quot;, along with James Gregory as her befuddled Senator husband, were just too awesome and memorable to erase from my brain.

A diverse group of people are trying to cope with nuclear war, mutants and each other, isolated in a remote house in the woods. One of the newcomers turns out to be a gangster, while another is slowly turning into an evolutionary novelty, complete with three eyes and really huge claws... Well, you get the picture.Since "The Day the World Ended" was done before the sexual revolution, the most we see of sex is a "classical" scene with two women bathing in old fashioned swimsuits which show very little, while The Monster is spying on them. There is also a "striptease" with very little stripping!The gangster is shot at the end, all radioactivity is washed away by the rain, and so is the zombified monster-man (!). The heroes get in touch with other survivors by ham radio, and we can all start over again. Until the next cyclical Kali Yuga, I suppose. For, according to our man Corman, "the end is the beginning".  Not *as* bad as I supposed, but hardly a good movie either. Only two stars.

Decent action segments here and there make it watchable but any and all dialogue should just be ignored...it makes little if any sense. This series really lost direction and seemed to become aimless, which is unfortunate because it seemed this could be a trilogy that could have stood alongside series like Star Wars and Indiana Jones, but instead the second two need to be written off to still enjoy the original. It's hard to make a good sequel, when it happens it's a beautiful thing(Aliens, T2, Spiderman 2, X2, Empire Strikes Back)but more often than not, we just end up with something like Matrix Reloaded.

$review_text.: Mysterious, dreamy, evocative.  &#34;Upstream  Color&#34; takes faith and an open mind.  The movie is the unique vision of one person, not the usual Hollywood mess concocted by too many cooks mutilating a good idea.  Shane Carruth had an idea, quirky and dreamlike, and he managed to bring it to the screen as a solo project, unfettered and as he imagined it.  Carruth wrote, produced, directed, acted, and scored.  What the viewer sees is exactly what one person imagined and recreated.  It's like reading a novel whose author writes as he wishes, with his own voice.It took a leap of faith to get into this movie, but I was quickly hooked, confused, and fascinated.  When it was over, I felt a compulsion to see it again ... then again, and again. After eight viewings I'm not sure I understand it fully even yet.  But each time through the movie is pure pleasure and an intriguing puzzle to work at solving.  A hobby.

$REVIEW.: The eighteenth annual &quot;Wrestlemania&quot; was the last to wear the WWF moniker before it was legally forced to change to World Wrestling Entertainment.Once you look past the &quot;dream match&quot; featuring &quot;Hollywood&quot; Hulk Hogan and The Rock, there really isn't much to this event. Hogan vs. Rock is not exactly a scientific classic as both men stretch their limited list of moves as far as it gets. This match lives up to its hype, though like most of the card, the outcome is predictable.There lies the biggest problem with most of this card. While we are getting to see a few big first-time meetings, it's clear that the younger guys are gonna win. It's about the veterans passing the torch. In one of the odder pairings, &quot;Stone Cold&quot; Steve Austin takes on Scott Hall. With all respect given to Hall, this one just doesn't look good on paper. As an opponent for the most popular athlete in the company, Hall just doesn't work. With Hall's past, it is clear who is gonna get the win here. The other big problem here is the feud was developed for barely even a month and while it worked with Hogan-Rock, it doesn't here.Aside from a very well-worked opening match with Rob Van Dam challenging William Regal for the Intercontinental Title and a better-than-usual Woman's match, this pay-per-view is pretty poor. Hogan and Rock should have closed the show as it was clearly more interesting than the World Title main event with Triple H and Chris Jericho. This match was pretty good though it's only real point of interest was the hope that Triple H would get his hands on Stephanie. The fans can never get enough of seeing Steph gets her. I always felt that she worked more effectively as the snobby heel. The rest of the card is average at best.

$review_text.: The thing I love most about this film is the casting


 Knowing very little about the book that it was based on, other than it was a book, I had no real expectations

 I didn't have some doubts about Sofia Coppela pulling of a film of her own, but it shows that her dad has raised another great director


 One reviewer on this site seems very unhappy that she Sofia Coppela was given a &quot;pampered&quot; life and had this movie handed to her
 Well....good!  She made a great film


 And her casting could not have been better done

 James Woods (True Believer, Vampires) gives an incredible, Oscar worthy performance as the father
 Kathleen Turner (Romancing the Stone, Body Heat) is incredible as the no-makeup, insane mother


 These two actors really set the tone for the film and make it what it is.Kirstin Dunst (Interview with the Vampire, Bring It On) seems to have been a more obvious choice for Lux
 She plays the sexy sister with the most lines


 With all the teen movies she is in right now, there is no doubt this was a rare chance for her to show of some real skill and she did.This is a great film
 Very much worth the time and money to check out

 As for Sofia Coppela being &quot;pampered&quot;, who cares!  Being the daughter of a great director is no differnt then being the daughter of a great chief, anything she does will probably be pretty good and she may in fact end up better than her father
 She is off to an excellent start.



$SUMMARY.: Very good film, great casting!

$REVIEW.: Lamberto Bava's 'Demons' is a pretty amusing film, if certainly not a good one
 It has two major flaws 1- It is heavily padded even at only 88 minutes 2- The demons aren't really very cool


 Zombies are almost invariably cool, even if they aren't necessarily scary or whatever
 The demons are just 'Evil Dead' demon knockoffs, but they lack their playfully sadistic personalities, which are largely what made them work


 That, and they try and attack people with elongated fingernail-claws, which is also kinda lame, I think


 They ain't too bad, but you need a really cool monster for a monster movie to totally work.Still, the bigger problem with the film is the padding
 For those who don't know, this film involves an outbreak of demonic horror in a movie theater


 Prior to the outbreak however, we are forced to watch a surprisingly large amount of the film they are viewing


 This film is extremely tedious, involving demonic possession and wandering around Nostradamus' tomb or something like that

 Whatever it is, it's very boring, and startlingly repetitious.(One guys turns into a demon, and stabs one chick like 12 times, and then is ripping through a tent which also requires a good dozen slashes)  Even worse, there is a subplot involving a number of, um, `punks', who just drive around in circles, snorting coke, for a number of scenes, until they eventually show up in the theater itself


 This is especially senseless, as the punks don't do anything particularly interesting once they show up at the theater, and it's not as if there was a shortage victims within the theater.(They are used to show how the demons get out of the theater, but they coulda done that some other way, or just not explained it, as with most everything else that happens in this movie.)  That, and there are a few too many scenes of people just standing around the theater, waiting to be ripped apart by demons.Still, there is a fair bit of demon action, and it's quite amusing

 This film is plenty gory, though it isn't quite the gorefest I had been led to believe it was
 Still, it delivers pretty well, with some plenty ripping and gouging and biting and all that


 The grossest stuff would definitely be the demons transformations, as we are treated to large pustules which burst in a gout of neon pus, and a nice scene of some demon teeth growing in while forcing out some human teeth

 There's also some sword action towards the end, as the demons get there comeuppance, though it's not as not delicious as one would hope or anticipate.There is no real characterization in this film, the acting/dubbing is about what you'd expect, and very little that happens is explained or makes any real sense

 None of that matter all that much, but it deserves mentioning
 There is a badass pimp dude, however

 He's cool, and the only character of any interest

 Visually, it has it's moments, but a movie theater is such a dull setting that they can't do all that much
 They use lots of colored lighting, mostly red and blue, which is occasionally effective

 Most of the time it just isn't all that interesting looking, however.Lotsa people like to whine about the music, but I think it fits the film pretty well


 The actual score, by Simonetti from Goblin, is actually pretty weak, and easily the worst thing I've heard from him or Goblin as a whole

 Too techno-y, and kinda annoying some of the time
 The 80's pop/rock music they use is quite amusing, I think, particularly the old-school speed metal from Saxon and Accept, and Billy Idol's 'White Wedding'.(the only highlight of the time-wasting punk subplot)  Some people complain that the music dates the film, but you know what other aspects of the film date it? All of them

 So come up with another complaint, cause that one isn't valid.Yes, a fun movie


 Check it out

 If you like this you'll wanna check out `The Church', directed  by Michele Soavi, who plays the mask dude in this film
 Same basic setup, but in a church instead of a movie theater, naturally

 Not as gory, but the effects are of much higher quality, the demons look better, and it's a lot more stylish overall, with better music and atmosphere

 But, everyone else seems to like `Demons' more, so what do I know?

$REVIEW.: Clark comes out West to visit Missy and Willie.  Their reunion is joyous as he meets his two grandsons (one adopted) and granddaughter.  Missie has returned to teaching since they've had a couple of hard years.  Everything seems to be going great...Until her baby dies.  We watch both Missie and Willie struggle over this death.  Clark struggles watching his daughter in a deep depression and trying to find a way to restore her.  Willie takes a job as sheriff, but the town mayor isn't a nice guy and things don't go as planned at all!When watching these, I have to keep the movies separated from the books.  At this point, there's very little true between the two.  Nothing could ever take place of Janette Oke's books!

The plot will bring you back to thinking the way you thought as a kid and without spoiling anything in the movie, this also added to the value of making it a video to watch over again.One of my criteria for a good film is if I would watch it over again and I definitely would with this video.

$review_text.: James really delivered a disappointing film this time around, which leaves me with the question of what the hell was he doing the past 10 years? Did he really think some of us wouldn't notice the stolen material from other films that he used in his movie. James STOLE already used ideas from Aliens, King Kong, Conan the Barbarian, The Matrix 3, Lord of the Rings and more. The robotic machine the marines use were already in the 3rd Matrix, James just added a cover to the machine. Almost every animals movements in the film mimic the animals in Peter Jackson's King Kong, which his Co. did the CGI but didn't change the movement patterns at all, the giant lizard in King Kong moves exactly like the giant cat in Avatar, no originality at all. In the movie when Avatars are gathering others to fight they arrive at a tribe call 4 winds in the desert, 4 Winds is the name of a GOD in Conan the Barbarian & happens to be in the desert also.  I'd also like to add that a book series and DVD series called AVATAR has been made since at least 2003 so James didn't create the name either. The list goes on & on. Bottom line is that this film was missing so many details that the CGI really couldn't make up for it, and your left looking at some pretty colors. The sad thing is alot of people like this movie, even though its pure garbage, they are just easily entertained. James had 10 years to write this movie & all he came up with is junk. At the beginning of the movie, we are told that the lead characters brother died from " being mugged for the cash in his wallet". 75% of our $ now is in computers, are you really gonna believe that we still use cash in 2125 ? So right away the movie starts off bad. If you wanna see a good movie of James's watch Aliens, cause Avatar is a BIG disappointment.

$review_text.: I do not understand how this film could be highly rated.  It is so boring.  Totally bored woman x with no interest in anyone or anything is stalked by a boring man y with no interest in anyone or anything except convincing y that they fell in love last year.  No sign of any love or interest in each other. She is so bored with everything that she does not remember him. Flashbacks showing they encountered each other before. SURPRISE!  They do not have the exact memory!  She is apparently there this year with a man, but there is no evidence of any relationship between then, so who cares who he is.  So it doesn't matter that you do not find out who he is.  Who cares if x does or does not go off with y?If you love Tati's Playtime and give it 5 stars, you probably would love this. Although maybe not, Marienbad kind of sort of almost has a plot and kind of sort of has characters x and y.Regret that I bought this (stupidly let myself be led by all the 5 star ratings).  If you are curious about this film, I recommend renting it first

$review_text.: Being a male I was never much of a fan of the chick flick, however I usually just accept that women like these movies for the same reasons that men like horror-gore movies (not to essentialize but not many women appreciate this genre). However after seeing this movie I felt compelled to write a reveiw.Basically the plot is somewhat predictable and horribly cliche; enough people ran through it already so I do not beleive that it is my duty. However the most predictable parts of this movie are when she goes to the Italian lovers house and finds out that he already has a woman under his roof. (Perhaps she should have rode back with the officer and then made this movie at least interesting).It is from the aformentioned point that the movie goes seriously downhill. The author found it neccessarey to give this movie a happy ending and amazingly one fell from the sky, with the American author appearing out of nowhere and the deadfully cheesy out of class relationship with the Polish kid and the Italian girl.Overall I recommend this movie if you can forgive movie cliches and random happy endings; well all of that and of course bad acting and fourth grade directing.The scenery was however beatiful, but what a waste.

One of the funniest things about these were their function: were they meant for educational purposes? informing the unsuspecting public? or a way to distract the students while the teachers snuck away for a wee nip or nicotine fix? It's a real blast to see the 50s family unit in 'What it Means to Be an American', the correct proper dating guidelines in 'Going Steady' and two double creature features in 'A Circus Wakes Up' and 'Wing Claw & Fang'. You can never go wrong with social deviance as demonstrated in 'Teenagers on Trial' or the female power brigade of 'Women in Blue'. However, the topper for me is the strange twilight zonish, drivers ed short of the risk of becoming another accident fatality in 'Highway Mania'. This is just an example of what Rifftrax does best.

Directed by Shinchiro Watanabe (Cowboy Bebop, Animatrix), designed by Kazuto Nakazawa (Kill Bill Vol 1) and Mahiro Maeda (Last Exil, Vlue Submarine 6) this isn't your grandfather's anime.  Not only is the music hot, the artwork perfect, but even the English voice cast is great.  Mugen is voiced by Daniel Andrews( also known as Steven Jay Blum), Fuu is voiced by Kari Wahlgren and Jin is voiced by Kirk Thornton and we also have Wendee Lee, Steve Kramer, Lex Lang, Darrel Guilbeau and Tony Oliver as some of the backup voices.Think Cowboy Bebop in Japan during the Age of War.

$review_text.: Easily the biggest surprise hit of the year, THE AMERICAN isn't quite an espionage thriller (it moves far too slowly), nor is it a romance (though there is plenty of that).  It's really one man's quest for identity, set against his job as an American spy in Italy, and involving his entanglement with some local beauties (who may or may not be who they seem).THE AMERICAN is a mostly-foreign film that certain does not fit the expectations of many of the people who saw it (check out all the negative reviews here for proof of that).  It's a slow-burner, heightened by George Clooney's melancholy performance; he's basically channeling UP IN THE AIR's Ryan Bingham through a watered-down Seth Gecko (FROM DUSK 'TIL DAWN).  We've seen him better, but he's perfect for this role.  The ladies who surround him--names woefully unfamiliar to most of us--easily hold their own.  The entire cast provides that extra touch of reality that anchors the film and gives it that extra bit of emotional resonance.Anton Corbijin's directing is equally top-notch.  The problem lies in the script (I won't comment on Martin Booth's novel, as I have not read it; typically, the book is better than the film, but you know this), which moves too slowly for its own good.  Not that this is a fast-paced story, or should be; but there can be tension in emotional tales, suspense in the mundane--we don't need bullets flying around to put us on the edge of our seats.  Rowan Joffe's script doesn't give us that.  If the script had been up to par with the cast, directing, and cinematography, the film would have been a close contender for status of "modern classic."  As is, it's above-mediocre, though it will alienate a lot of people who watch it, expecting something far different.

$REVIEW.: "Laverne & Shirley" regardless of which season I've been viewing, always makes me laugh-out-loud with each episode. The antics the girls get into, the situations which arise, and the comedic expertise of all the cast involved, makes this a most memorable, hilarious and enjoyable season one can watch over and over. I feel this is the kind of television comedy we sorely lack in today's programming, so I enjoy going "back in time" and reliving some of these classics.Both Laverne and Shirley, along with Carmine, Laverne's dad, Frank, Lenny and Squiggy, and all the other loveable characters that made this series such a success have the wonderful bond of friendship and love that underscores their various funny capers yet bonds these characters to make them each so very likeable. Each cast member is so talented and unique in their own way of comedic expression that one can't help but love them each individually. Despite all the various antics everyone gets into, they all are rooted with a strong sense of caring and love for one another - giving definitely a wonderful sense of being even in a comedy series such as this. There is a message, if even in a comedic way, that there are more important things in the world than what the outer issues appear to be. One such episode comes to mind from this particular season: the girls are chosen to spend a weekend at something like ROTC training, where they compete with the men's group to prove that females are also strong in combat and can handle themselves as well as the guys. In the end, when the girls end up saving the life of an opposing male recruit (who won't, of course, recognize that they lost the race because of saving him) they, although in their hilariously funny way, show that it's better to have lost the race of who's better/faster/longer able to exist in the cold wilderness when it means they gave up the race to save the life of an injured man. Vicki Lawrence does a fantastically funny presentation in the role of their sergeant.Laverne & Shirley is a hilarious yet feel-good series. Sure wish there were more shows today like it!

As expected, there's lots of sex (oh, those French), but in the end this is a real movie with some interesting things to say.  However, without revealing too much, I will say this: in the movie's closing moments, we learn that a character has gotten off ridiculously and unbelievably easy for committing a capital crime several scenes earlier, which took me out of the story for a moment or two.  Having said that, this movie is still definitely worth a look.  The DVD features a nice, sharp widescreen image and a few modest extras.

$REVIEW.: So I love the movieHeathers - 20th High School Reunion Edition, which is one of the reasons I was excited to try out this film. The lead character, played by Simon Baker, is accidentally e-mailed a list of every woman he's ever slept with, including the ones he hasn't even met yet. Even though he's married, he goes on a quest to meet all these women and have sex with them, not bothering with relationships but just wham bam on to the next one. Meanwhile, Winona Ryder's character is a kind of black widow who goes after misogynistic men. Wonder of wonders, she's the last one on his list.I didn't like this film. It was tedious, it was boring, and it wasn't funny. I only watched it to complete this review, but I wouldn't even recommend you do that. Rent Heathers.

$review_text.: My copy of this movie is in the Kim Novak collection and is beautifully restored. Was purchased in 2014.  The movie is beautifully cast, beautifully photographed.  Some reviews that consider William Holden to be too old for the role certainly have merit. However, he is so spot on in the role that I was willing to consider that the way this man had lived his life had aged him prematurely.  The transfer from stage to film was obvious in several places where the lines rang false.  You can always notice these things.  Rosaline Russell overacts as usual and it gets tiresome but she certainly portrays the desperation of this character.  One has to consider what being unmarried meant in that period of time.  I would like to have seen a less romantic ending.  One knows that Hal is doing nothing more than building his own ego when he pursues and wins Madge.  He is one upping his rich college buddy.  Hal will never change and in a couple of years Madge will be getting off that bus back at home sadder and wiser than when she left.

$review_text.: A coming-of-age film about the choices a family makes and the difficulty of dealing with the death of a loved one while living in a foreign land, far from your comfort zone and extended family. The film is linear, taking us on the journey of a marriage between two strangers, their adjustment to one another, and how they grow as their 'Americanized' children grow and push agaisnt their parents' cultural values. Many of the 'opposing values' scenes are subtle, which makes them more powerful in my opinion. This movie based on the best selling novel by Jhumpa Lahiri is one I found endearing. I suspect that my seventeen year old son only watched it because it featured Kal Penn (Harold and Kumar go to White Castle), but he's glad he saw it and appreciated Kal Penn's ability to play a 'serious' role with such heart.Chrissy K.

$review_text.: I saw this version of "A Christmas Carol" in the movies on Christmas Day in 1970. I have been in love with it ever since. I think Leslie Bricusse's music captures the essence of the scenes - especially the Crachit children (Christmas Children, The Beautiful Day). The performances of all the cast are excellent - I especially enjoy David Collings, an actor well known in England but seldom seen in the US, as Bob Crachit. Paddy Stone (who has little to do as the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come) is the unsung choreographer, whose exuberant work is well served by Anton Rodgers & the ensemble in "Thank You Very Much" and the closing scenes.Now, Albert Finney. I shall never understand why they felt obligated to try to obscure his handsome features (he was certainly in his prime) to the extent they did. I think it would have been even more poignant to see him still attractive, if aged by his miserable attitude - it is my only criticism of the film. At least we get to see him without the makeup in the past. His performance is extraordinary. I was not a big fan of his before this movie, but he did an amazing job of investing in the character, disguising his height and performing the songs with pathos and true feeling. When he hates men, he really hates them. His final scene with Isabel (You, You) is the absolutely most wrenching and compelling version in any adaptation of the story and I own nine. It was a stroke of genius to let him do the songs himself and leave them alone.If you don't love this movie, you are tone deaf, have no sense of rhythm and no heart. In fact, you are even worse off than Scrooge. If you see someone who looks like Sir Alec Guinness headed your way, run!

$review_text.: I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.Pros: Worked up a moderate sweat


 Some of the moves were pretty tough

 Much better than the other Angles workout from same instructor
 Instructor non-annoying.Cons: Explanations were good but I would have gladly traded half of them for more of a steady transition-cue and a count (or louder music with beat to follow) since a lot of moves you face down or away from the tv
 Overall, not as tough as I hoped --- could use more repetition of medium-tough moves in place of easier, pretty-filler-balance moves.I am thinking this would be good for beginners starting to work on their toning and flexibility or intermediate where you don't need to push too hard (a workout, not a challenging workout.)

$REVIEW.: With all the hype, I have sad news to report

 Overrated and unrealistic.Let's start with the very first episode "Pilot."  The black guy with the green eyes(Gary Dourdan) leaves a rookie CSI agent by herself when she is dusting for fingerprints at a robbery/homicide crime scene.After he leaves, the killer naturally comes back and kills the rookie cop.The reason Dourdan leaves is to go place a bet on a pro football game.He is placing a bet for a judge that he is bribing to get a search warrant for on a case he is working.Dourdan places the bet on the opposite team that the judge asked him to bet on and loses.Meanwhile, the rookie CSI agent is being killed.After the whole thing goes down, Dourdan is at first put on administrative leave but then re-instated once Will Petersen takes over at the end of the show.He vows to do better next time.WTF?  Wouldn't he have at least been fired for abandoning his post?  I would think he would be criminally prosecuted also for leaving the rookie unprotected.Dourdan seemed to be more concerned about solving his case than the slain officer and the lack of emotion was terribly played out.Petersen, Helgenberg, and the other officers also seemed remorseless and had a "well, we need to move on" attitude

 By the next show the rookie is completely forgotten and it's business as usual.So much for this so-called drama.As you watch more and more the storylines tend to all be the same

 Two crimes, they solve the crime within the same episode, and nobody gets wrongly accused.The show is supposed to be based on Las Vegas, but I wager it's really taking place in Fantasyland.For much better dramatic police shows, I recommend HBO's "The Wire", and FX's "The Shield".

$review_text.: There's something very comforting for some reason about watching pretty girls in lovely period costumes suffering in beautifully decorated English country houses, and here the girls are especially pretty and the costumes are especially lovely. The houses are also completely top of the line: Castle Howard in Yorkshire, the most dramatic house in England, is used for Longlands, the home of the Duke of Trevenick. But while visually this is a rare feast, dramatically "The Bucccaneers" is not quite all it should be. Edith Wharton started the unfinished novel on which it is based with an idea very much like her best social comedies: if wealthy nouveau riche American beauties could not make it into Old New York society, why not try to make it into the top of the British aristocracy by providing large dowries? Girls like Consuelo Vanderbilt and the wealthy Langhorne sisters of Virginia (on whom Wharton based her St. George sisters) did exactly that; but marrying into such position did not guarantee happiness. Nor in this miniseries, unfortunately, does it always provide much narrative excitement: the direction is not simply langurous but incredibly slowly-paced, and most of the acting is only passable, with a few striking exceptions (such as Jenny Agutter, who is very fine as the miserable mistress to Lord Seadown). But the miniseries also features at its end a terrific documentary on Edith Wharton, which raised my rating of it from three stars to four.

If you like the silly Godzilla movies of the 60's and beyond, you'll probably get a kick out of these lower budget, goofier movies.  Clearly made for children, some even seem to be scripted by kids.  That makes them uniquely bizarre and fun.Also included are: "Yongary..."- a Korean Godzilla movie.  Nothing special, but cool to see.  "Warning..."- no giant monsters and is probably included to cut costs and maximize profits for St. Clair Vision, the manufacturer.  "The Giant Gilla Monster"- an American cheapie from the 50's and is highlighted by several very cool old hot rods of the era and not much else.  "Monster...Prehistoric Planet"- a Japanese version of "Gorgo" (humans capture a really fantastic giant monster, but soon find out it has a very protective, much, much bigger mother who's pissed and wants her baby back.  Oops!If you already know you like this kind of movie, buy it.  If not, but you're curious, find a really cheap copy of "Attack of the Monsters," and then decide

$review_text.: Dont go much to pictures. Costs too much and most aint worth seein. But this one looked pretty good. Lots a tuff guys that didnt take crap off a nobody. Had an awful lot a muscles. Only time I see so many six packs is when I go to 7-11.The storys sposed to be true. The Persia king invades Greece to make the people slaves. The Sparta men dont like that and decide to fight even though they know there gonna lose. I couldnt figure why the Sparta king talked like that guy who played James Bond.The Persia king is a [bundle of sticks] or I dont know one when I see one. Alma Jr says Persia is Iran. I guess the movies sayin the guy runnin Iran is a [bundle of sticks]. I figger that makes the Sparta men Americans.Theres a lot of fightin and a lot a blood flyin ever which way. The fightin got me boilin. It reminded me a how Jack and I wrestled. I had real strong dreams about Jack for a coupla weeks.When the Sparta boy got his head cut off I wanted to stomp the Persia guys into the ground. Made me think a Jack gettin beat with a tire iron. Hadnt thought a that in a long time.The Sparta men lose but they figure they really won because they stood up for what was right. Cant argue with that. I liked it when the Sparta king said he woulda died for any of his men.Alma Jr knows a lot a things. I ask her Did the Sparta men... You know...? She says shell look it up. Coupla days later she tells me.Sparta kept the men away from the women, and workin at being good soldiers, until it was time to get married. So the older guys had sex with the younger guys until the older ones got hitched. And they wore leather armor when they fought -- no little briefs, and definitely no capes.That helps partly but it makes me think of another question Im scared to ask. Did they have... boyfriends? My face turns red.Alma Jr looks at me real sweet and says No probly not. All they did was fight. And when they werent fightin they trained really hard. Hardly had time to love their wives let alone each other. But they loved their country. And they loved each other as friends. And they died for each other.I remember Alma Jr tellin Cassie she didnt think I was the marryin kind. She must a known all along. Its been 25 years but this is the first shes let on she knows.I want to cry. Dont want Alma Jr to see me but cant hold back. Shes a grandma but she sits in my lap and puts her arms around my neck and cries too. I wish Id met him she says. He must have been a wonderful person for you to have loved him so much. Alma Jr must a seen the shirts and postcard sometime.She dont know what a coward I was. If Id a been brave and stood by Jack like the Sparta men did for each other, we woulda had our little operation and Jack wouldna got killed.Damn how I wish Jack was still here. He woulda liked this picture too.-- Ennis Del Mar

$review_text.: Stylish, surprisingly modern, this 50's style film unites many big themes as they roll through the landscape of Hartford suburbia in the film, &quot;Far From Heaven&quot;.Todd Haynes recreates the somewhat dullish, over dramatic style of 50's melodramas with a well thought out, dynamic script that manages to tackle issues so relevant to today
Things are never what they seem from the outside, as his characters play pretend okay while their inner lives are being shattered at every turn
It's daring to allow them the full course of their emotions, all the while repressing them every chance they get


It's the dichotomy that drives this film, ever so successfully.Rest assured, Julianne Moore gives the perfomance of a lifetime in the role of Cathy Whittaker
Every bit the proper, refined housewife, Julianne manages to take a role that could very easily be overacted, and gives her dignity and control and a sense of vulnerability all at the same time

Her range and skill as a performer leads me to see films that she is in simply because she is in them, and I cannot say that about many other actors
Dennis Quaid and Patricia Clarkson also wallop their roles wonderfully.Todd Haynes' &quot;Far From Heaven&quot; should have been more heavily lauded from critics and audiences, and Oscars alike


This is one film that will remain as a hallmark of invention for years to come.

$review_text.: While this movie seems to be getting alot of attention, I've been scratching my head to figure out why. As many people have said, it attempts to state the facts and not make judgements or take sides, etc. That's terrific, but I think this film should have been a documentary in that case, which I would have enjoyed much more (and I sincerely mean that, by the way). Even those who liked the movie admit that the audience never gets a chance to "know" the characters, and once the fighting starts, it never stops. Again, realism is great, but I don't enjoy feeling lie I am being shot at for 2 hours (I know how much that sounds like a crabby old person). Because there is no attempt at moralizing, taking any side, or giving us anything (emotional, philosophical, ANYTHING) for us to chew on, this movie just succeeded in making me nauseous, just as Hannibal had done. However boring people think "The Thin Red Line" is, at least there was an attempt on the filmakers' part to let the audience become emotionally and/or mentally involved. Through "Black Hawk Down" I was just cringing to avoid enemy gunfire, with no relief for 2 hours. This may be exactly the point of the film; I don't know why I would want to or enjoy (in the broadest sense of the word) paying money to do that.  (Anyway, when it comes time to "was this review helpful", please remember, as always, that it doesn't say "do you agree with this.")

$REVIEW.: I was soooooooooooooooo impressed with all the performances, but I was absolutely bowled over by Ed Harris' interpretation of "Jackson Pollock, the Artist."  WOW!  I was quite impressed.If you aren't familiar with "Pollock," the Artist and his Art, chances are that you wouldn't be seeking out his biography, unless you were a fan of and searching for, an Ed Harris film to watch.  Personally, I was aware of both, but have to admit I was a fan, more of the latter than the former.The life of "Pollock" is shown in all the beauty and horror (mostly inner horror) that this troubled Artist experienced.  His wife, played by Marcia Gay Harden, was his main support system, both professionally as well as in his mostly alcohol lubricated role as husband.This was (to me) the strongest part I have seen Mr. Harris perform.  I am now researching all of his movies to broaden my experience with his talent.

Since thosetimes, we lost quite a lot in tolerance and imagination, in curiosity anf generosity.Hedlund, Riley, Sturridge and Stewart are extraordinary actors, especially Stewart and Hedlund.That's what I call dedication. I don't understand why americans hate Stewart so much. She is brilliant, intelligent, breathtaking.I loved her too in The Yellow Handkerchief, Speak, The Cake Eaters, welcome to the Rileys.

$REVIEW.: Yes the Prisoner series was expertly photographed (for 1966 anyway). It had very good Shakespearean acting but that means it isn't much like real life as acting Bard-style is pretty unrealistic. It should be awfully hard for modern-day americans to identify so well with Shakespearean-acting old time Europeans. The central character/actor who plays Number 6 is a nervous type in reallife. In the book The Official Prisoner Companion it states  a crewmember testifying that the lead actor indeed had a problem with intimacy on the set of The Prisoner. Raed that book, that info in it and draw your own conclusions about what that says about this man's attitudes towards women in reallife. Yes he's married to a lady but question is what does this say about his attitude towards women. Lastlyu, it is only a  tv show not real life don't try hard to make perfecty sense out of it and remember tv is never quite like real life.

$REVIEW.: Not worth $68.00. I only paid about $8.00 for it. The story line wanders and it is hard to figure Miss Smith's (character) out; she's kind of a kook, controlling yet passive. curious yet acting as if she is use to it all. (the same old sex) thinking she has to fall in love with the guy. there is not that much 'good' sex in this one.. scenes appear too controlled and scripted, so its not as erotic as I had hoped for. I cant say its a total 'flop' but its nothing to rave about. its worth a look if you like screwy movies (not meaning sex..lol)but how the characters try and 'pursue' each other until they finally like each other enough to want to have sex. but if you must get this one, (cuz your a fan of Smith...'Mutant X') you want to find the least expensive price for it.

$REVIEW.: The aliens are called Souls and they have traveled from planet to planet taking over bodies and changing the said planets for the better. The story starts out when the entire planet has almost been concurred with only a few people not being controlled by  a soul. One of the souls (Wanderer) is placed into a body and starts to feel emotions it has never felt before from the young girls memories and starts to become empathetic to her plight. It finally helps the humans reverse some of what is happening but no complete solutions. The Souls are very delecate and really gullable. I don't know how they ever got started since they space travel in a little sliver footballs, which are not fast either, and need to be coaxed out and placed right next to a cut in the back of the neck. I'll have to read the book I guess to see how it all started.

$review_text.: I don't want to just rehash what has already been said (and there are already over 500 reviews on this movie) but I did want to give my impression of the movie in a different way.When I first entered college, I took an introduction to psychology course, taught by an especially gifted teacher.  Almost everyone in the class (myself included) was overcome by the &quot;Freudian Syndrome&quot; of believing every neurotic symptom described in the book applied to our lives.  Our teacher cheerfully explained this common phenomenon would occur and only those on the extreme end of the spectrum would be considered truly sick.This movie is one giant Freudian Syndrome.  The characters somehow connect with us because we have experienced their traumas at one point or another in our lives.  I tried not to be cynical, but I found it difficult to sympathize (or empathize) with any of the characters due to the fact that they are all so far &quot;out there&quot;.  Not to mention, many other reviewers have already pointed out the numerous &quot;common sense&quot; problems of who they choose to interact with and the reasons given in the movie as to why each person made the choices they did.  In other words, these people aren't real - they're cartoon characters.This movie was the introductory course (rental material).  If you liked this movie and you want the advanced course, then buy the movie that should have won Best Picture - Magnolia.

$REVIEW.: This low budget continuity issue zombie film takes place in Wisconsin
The movie opens with military personnel killing an infected human


These are fast moving zombies
We find out the cause of the infection about a third of the way into the film
Infected people sometimes speak with voice enhancers, sometimes without the enhancer, while others are typical blue faced mutes
Make-up was not consistent either.We then move to the subplot which makes attempts at humor

Matt (Roland James Williams) gets his car repossessed then asks to borrow his ex-girlfriend's car as she is walking out the door


He and Craig (Kyle Berg) have a bachelor party planned for John (Kevin Kiser)

After getting thrown out of a strip club, they head up north to a small town so the subplots can be united in zombie bliss.The acting was at the Mendoza line and the dialouge better than most low budget disasters


The film extra features a band, one that must have been used for a better than average metal sound track

The film has numerous gratuitous nude scenes that make it into both the outtakes and extended scenes, one which included a sex scene with the woman being disgusted and swearing that I thought should have stayed in the film.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (thank you Liz Ribarchek, Amber Rae Halama, Jocelyn Ridgely, plus an extra and 2-3 strippers) 3 1/2 stars

It is a very good-looking action film, riddled with cliches

This time around, Jason Statham gets to karate-chop thugs working for a hood blackmailing a Ukranian politician


He kidnaps the politician's daughter (played by real life Natasha, Natalya Rudakova) to force him to allow a shipment of toxic waste into his country.Statham is forced to drive Miss Broken English of 2008 around so the cops won't find her

Like the last Transporter film, a bomb is involved


This time its strapped to Statham's wrist to keep him in the car, driving


And there is alot of driving in Transporter 3, along with explosions, shooting and many well choreographed fight scenes
All in all, Transporter 3 is a pretty much what I expected, a good but somewhat mindless diversion.

I think this is one that families today will enjoy as much as we did when it first came out. Even though it is forty years old it was done as a period piece then and the production values were good and the cast and music is great. The message is pretty light stuff and easy to take. Anyone that likes some of the older comedies like "The Great Race" or "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" will enjoy it. The rivalries between the countries competing in the air race and the battle of the sex's are often funny. Airplane enthusiasts will definitely love seeing these pre-WWI airplanes in action. I bought the VHS years ago and I am looking forward to my DVD arriving.

$review_text.: The Astronaut's Wife, starring Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron was a major disappointment. My husband and I have what we call the 30-Minute Rule when it comes to watching DVD's. Since our spare time is so limited, if we are not completely engrossed in the movie at the end of 30 minutes, we stop and put something else on.I'm sorry to say that The Astronaut's Wife did not make it past the 30-Minute rule. In fact, I found myself watching the timer, wishing the minutes would go by faster so we could find a better way to waste our time.The first thing is, the movie is slow. Very, very, very slow. There are lots of camera angles on Charlize Theron looking thoughtful, Charlize looking pensive, Charlize looking worried, Charlize looking scared, Charlize looking sad- well, you get the idea. Everything seems to happen as though we are watching it through a very long tunnel-- noises are slightly muted and have an "out-of-body" sound to them.Even Johnny Depp is not enough to save this movie. The feeling I generally get when watching Johnny Depp in a role is that nobody else could have played that part because he makes it so much his own. In this instance, however, I can think of a dozen different actors who could have played the part, and we wouldn't have noticed the difference.If you must watch it, put it on fast forward and read the subtitles. That way you'll get it over with faster.

$review_text.: This is an indie film about life without much plot

Leigh London (Kristen Bell) is an AP reporter who has become depressed with life

She wrote a story about a chained tiger cub living in the city apartment that dies

She sees herself in this role, as well as just about everyone else in the film fits the metaphor

People view themselves as developing while everyone else sees them as screw-ups.Leigh moves back with her parents, and mom (Amy Madigan) would rather not have her there

She hangs out with old friends; Todd (Martin Starr) a gay art dealer and Mel (Mamie Gummer) who is now the vice principal

Mel's life is in a rut, her husband (Joshua Harto) doesn't fit in because he is too straight


Leigh becomes a lifeguard at the local apartment complex, however like the tiger, the title has a two-fold meaning.The story slips into taboo areas such as smoking pot with minors...and having sex with them

There are lines that are crossed, i.e

"they are screw-ups" or the less family friendly phrase, but they don't see themselves as that because the transition is smooth and natural
The film is about how life and people are the same all over (except for Vermont).Clearly this film is not for everyone


It opens like a Lifetime film with raindrops symbolizing sadness
It evolves into a film which would make you embarrassed to watch it with your kids
Indie lovers only, please.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, male nudity


Drug use.

It has a white rabbit, a samurai, a tiger, a knight, a World War II Fighter plane, Don Juan, chorus girls, and many other fun and fanciful elements.Kirk gets involved in an extended fist fight and gets knocked around considerably.

$review_text.: DOWNTON ABBEY is one of the things the British do best. This seven part series has it all - crisp dialogue, stunning settings/scenery/costumes, an all-encompassing view of class distinction not only between the upper class or gentry versus the middle class (who often have as much money but come into via labor versus inheritance) but also among the servant class, and a cast of many of the finest British actors before the public. Julian Fellowes is in fine form here as the writer, taking on a story about 1912 England and the microcosm of Downton Abbey, a mansion and grounds run by the elegant Robert Crawley, Earl of Grantham (Hugh Bonneville), his mother Violet, the Dowager Countess of Grantham (Dame Maggie Smith at her best), and Cora Crawley Countess of Grantham (Elizabeth McGovern0 - the moneyed American whom Robert married in order to retain the Abbey and their daughters, Ladies Mary (Michelle Dockery), Edith (Laura Carmichael) and Sybil (Jessica Brown Findlay). Much of the story revolves around the problem of inheritance (entailment) as the heirs apparent to the Abbey are victims of the Titanic disaster that opens the story. The Abbey must be passed on to a monied heir and the hunt is on.As with other Masterpiece Theater pieces this story examines the 'upstairs/downstairs' bifurcation of the Abbey and the cast of characters 'below' is as fine as the gentrified owners: Mr Carson (Jim Carter) is the head voice, followed by Mrs. Hughes (Phyllis Logan), the cook Mrs. Patmore (Lesley Nicol), the footman Thomas (Rob James-Collier) who just happens to have had an affair with the visiting Duke who could have been the new heir, and the new valet John Bates (Brendan Coyle) - a man the staff doesn't tolerate because of his use of a cane due to a war injury, etc etc etc. They are all fascinating people with their own set of prejudices not unlike those of their masters.The story progresses along the lines of finding a new heir for the Abbey, a problem that involves everyone in the household, and it is this strange playing out of English class distinction that makes the series so engrossing. Another classic from the Masterpiece Theater. Grady Harp, January 12

$REVIEW.: GREAT movie, Heath Ledger was awesome, the scope, visual effects, and storyline were awesome!!!  Well worth the money (in terms of the MOVIE itself)!  One problem I had with it was the same problem I have with all movies that have came out lately, the audio being quiet with the dialogue and then becoming extremely loud when action sequences kick in, so you are constantly adjusting the volume..
 Looks great on blu-ray even on my regular SDTV (you CAN tell the difference even if you can't afford HDTV)..

Bonus disc pretty much sucked it's just some Gotham news, Psychology of batman and enemies, gadgets, and trailers..


 I was VERY upset that they had NOTHING on Heath Ledger, not one feature congratulating his success in the role, dying to make the movie, no in memory of, no Special Thanks (Christian Bale gets a Special Thanks though...), NOTHING!!  Just patting their selves on the back for making an awesome movie, it's CRAP that they would do that, if you want my opinion it's completely selfish and entirely RUDE not to mention him, also there are no interviews or comprehensive coverage of a whole lot of anything on the special features..


 very disappointing, makes you feel like you wasted your money (on the 2 disc special)..

 Don't get me wrong though the movie was FANTASTIC, best batman ever they took a much more serious approach as to the action and the Joker...

$review_text.: This is one beauty of a head-scratcher. It is, literally, 3 movies in one. Al Adamson made the tight-yet-pointless heist film ECHO OF TERROR (a/k/a TWO TICKETS TO TERROR) in 1964, only to see it chopped up and intermixed with new footage several years later (starring John Carradine as an ethical but mad scientist) and retitled MAN WITH THE SYNTHETIC BRAIN, and sold as a horror cheapie to television. Not to be outdone, he and producer Sam Sherman further complicated matters by adding a third plot strand to the mix (something to do with killer zombies and yet another mad scientist, not to mention a rather sickly looking Tommy Kirk), and another new title, BLOOD OF GHASTLY HORROR. In order for the final incarnation to make sense, there are flashbacks-within-flashbacks all over the place.  There was yet another version, PSYCHO-A-G-GO, which had musical numbers spliced amongst the madness!Amazingly, it's quite an enjoyable viewing experience following the severely warped logic of the narrative, which only gets more confusing with each viewing.Topping it off is some of the best commentary I've yet heard on any dvd, provided by Sam Sherman, who promises to some day restore the integrity of Adamson's ECHO OF TERROR to its original glory (well, one can hope).As with Ed Wood, it's hard not to admire director Al Adamson's earnestness, and Vilmos Szigmond's cinematography (on the ECHO OF TERROR portions), despite the faded print used for the dvd, shows a precocious eye for composition. A most unusual recommendation!

$REVIEW.: I feel like there was never a time that I didn't know MIRACLE ON 34th STREET, so intimately is this wonderful movie connected with the Christmas season. MIRACLE is a richer and more complex film than many take it to be, and it can be enjoyed on more that one level. It is a heart-warming parable of child-like faith overcoming cynicism. It is also a satire on big business, commercialism, psychoanalysis (which was becoming popular in the 1940's), and political machines. For me, the most interesting element of the movie is the subplot involving the psychiatrist, Mr. Sawyer (Porter Hall), who has ambitions of being a psychoanalyst but is stuck in an unfulfilling job giving intelligence tests. He dabbles in Freudian studies on the side and, filled with delusions of grandeur, thinks that he is qualified to psychoanalyze Alfred, an impressionable young boy who works at Macy's. This encroachment on the innocence of children raises the ire of Kris Kringle, the Macy's Santa Claus with delusions of his own; by acting out his anger on Sawyer, he gets himself committed to a sanitarium. That Sawyer is ultimately defeated (when Mr. Macy fires him) is fitting and just, but also - like many villains in classic drama - gives him a hope of redeeming himself. Porter Hall, Gene Lockhart (as the judge), Philip Tonge, William Frawley, Jerome Cowan, Maureen O'Hara, John Payne, and young Natalie Wood all make this movie sparkle; and as for Edmund Gwenn - what can I say? - he IS Santa Claus!

$review_text.: I already reviewed the regular "Motion Picture Trilogy" containing the non-extended editions of the legendary Lord of The Rings masterpieces on one set

However, this newest edition is a grand improvement on the previous edition


This item is a much, MUCH better investment than the old theatrical counterparts and is perhaps the greatest DVD purchase one will likely ever make.A lot "Director's Cut" scenes are usually just added footage that doesn't do a whole lot to add onto the theatrical edition of movies with examples like Star Wars, Manhunter, or even most of the "Aliens" movies as well

The extra material is just that, extras, that wouldn't kill me to never see again.It's a totally different story altogether with the "Lord Of The Rings" movies altogether


While the regular theatrical editions were mind-blowing, the extended cuts of the same films do wonders in fleshing out the story and expanding the characters a lot more


Several characters that were not much more than background people are shown much more screen time, stories are greatly expanded, other scenes are much more meaningful, and the movies overall have a totally different feel altogether thanks to all of the extra footage that was not included on the theatrical editions


Now as I watch them, the old editions of them are rendered almost completely obsolete due to the chopped up nature of them

I sometimes wonder if Peter Jackson grimaced when he had to leave a lot of extra shots out of the movies to fit them onto the theatres when they were released."Fellowship" has 30 minutes of extra footage included to a length of 3 and a half hours

"The Two Towers" was extended 43 minutes to a total of 3 hours and 42 minutes and finally "The Return of The King" is extended by a grand 50 minutes and the ultimate result is a whopping 4 hours and 11 minutes long! I don't know about you but I don't know how one can make a longer movie like this but Jackson did it! The grand total of all three extended editions is at least an astronomical 11 hours long! This is just the movies themselves.As for all of the extras on the "Extended Editions", there are over a days worth of extras for surf through on the latter two discs of each film set

The things on them are too great to explain in detail with this review.Whether you buy them individually or all at once on this massive gift set, "The Lord of The Rings" trilogy goes down as the greatest trilogy of all time


You could not make a better purchase

I swear it!

$review_summary.: The Ultimate DVD set for all time!

$REVIEW.: Chinatown is a classic in the original sense.  It's brooding and often dark plot offer's a real treat for any fan of film noir.  Save only that it is in color instead of black and white.  But this fact does not detract from this being a great film.  This is, perhaps, one of Jack Nicholson's greatest film roles.

$review_text.: I can deal with bad acting and ridiculous plots, I even enjoy such things but I could barely watch this whole movie
The movies starts off with a terrible disembodied voice that was kind of funny then goes into a great death scene where this guy gets his stomach fingered to death by 'the killer' while his girlfriend is shrieking obnoxiously

I would like to add that when I said great death scene I meant so bad it was funny death scene


The rest of the movie is basically a bore that has no scary parts and is a drag to watch.

I learned what women are good for, and how I am supposed to treat them as a man. I learned about geography too - why everybody likes Paris so much.Last but not least, I also learned a new use for butter.(NOTE: I only wish they had done something with cottage cheese, the most erotic of the dairy products.)Other than that, the only real complaint I have about this movie is that it doesn't really show you how to do the tango, so the name is kind of misleading. For that, I can only give this 4 stars rather than 5.

$review_text.: Jacques Tourneur's "Curse of the Demon" (1958) is a worthy companion piece to the director's "Cat People" (1942) and "I Walked With a Zombie" (1943)


Rich in atmosphere and characterization, this British chiller remains among the best of the genre


The Demon's brief appearance was inserted by the producers against Tourneur's wishes, yet it succeeds as a terrifying image


For years, we have been stuck with the 83-minute American version, which was 12 minutes shorter than the British release
However, the video reissue of "Curse of the Demon" now features the original 95-minute print - a wonderful surprise, since Columbia did not mention this upgrade in its VHS packaging
The result is a must-own for horror buffs.

$REVIEW.: The story of the three hundred Spartans is not the oldest legend originating from Greece, but is certainly the most famous. Although, Hollywood already had one version in 1962, it's but a shadow of, " 300 ". Seeing the original and then watching this update, viewers will immediately see the difference. The first is candy coated and offered to entertain audiences holding a box of popcorn. This movie with it's spectacular visual panorama, violent action scenes and overall dramatic effects, will cause you to hold your breath. Gerard Butler, is impressive as King Leonidas. Dominic West as Theron and Vincent Regan as the Captain. Rodrigo Santoro is Xerxes, in modern gang attire and jewelry. This film may have originated in comic pages, but it explodes on the silver screen as iconic art. This version is sure to inspire some to visit the site of the heroic last stand, but may also inspire others to delve into the history books. On that note, there are minor historical mistakes, such as the Spartan king demeaning the Atheans as boy-lovers (which law allowed) but in fact, it was Spartan culture which habitually practice pederasty. Another literary goof, was the use of War-rhinos, elephants and mutants. One in particular which bothered me was the Greek traitor 'Ephialtes' as having been deformed. No historical reference to that. The idea of single Spartan fathers training their sons individually goes against traditional schooling in military academies. One last criticism. The Spartans claimed they fought for freedom and stated the Persian king was a tyrant. Any history book on Sparta, will illuminate the fact, Sparta used Helots as Slaves. Nevertheless, if you don't mind, these and a few other inaccuracies, the film will astonish you with its movie magic and I predict, will imprint itself as a Classic. *****

$REVIEW.: Good sf movies are few and far between. So are horror movies. Good horror sf movies are even more rare. Sorry but Apollo 18 was not a good sf or horror for me.Spoiler:The basic theme seems sound: There was a mission after 17 which went to the moon and discovered Russian cosmonauts had been there as well as a "menace" which had killed the Russians and contaminated one of our astronauts. This we know from secret film which was edited to make the movie.Supposedly degraded film and shaking the camera do not make a good horror movie or sf movie. This film is a big bust so don't waste your money or your time. The trailer was better than the movie.

$review_text.: The Dragon Ball Z Season Six DVD box set includes six DVDs that contain twenty-nine episodes.  The first three discs contain six episodes, the fourth disc contains five episodes, the fifth disc contains three episodes, and the sixth disc contains three episodes and the DVD extras.  The focus of the episodes on this set is the Cell Games saga.One of the best features of the Dragon Ball Z sets is the marathon feature; this allows you to watch all of the episodes back-to-back.  However, with the marathon feature, you only see the opening credits once, and the ending credits are not shown.  This feature is very helpful when you're trying to watch all of the episodes on a disc in a single sitting.The menu on the sixth DVD adds in a link for the special features.  However, the features aren't very special.  All you get are the textless versions of the opening and ending credits (which is a feature that was included on the previous five DVD box sets), and trailers.  The trailers included on this set are for One Piece, xxxHOLIC, Hana, Case Closed, Jyu-Oh-Sei, Love and Honor, Vexille, and Dragon Ball Z.I also have issues with the audio mastering levels on this set.  FUNimation's splash screen at the beginning of the discs, the trailer at the start of the disc, and the menu are mastered at a high audio level.  However, the actual episodes themselves were mastered at a very soft audio level.  And on this set, a couple of the episodes were mastered even lower than usual, so the sound was rather muddy and very hard to hear.While I was disappointed with the audio levels and the lack of special features, this set is still a "must get" for any Dragon Ball Z fan that wants all the episodes on DVD.In order to write this review, I checked out a copy of this DVD box set through the King County Library System.

$REVIEW.: I was a devout follower of this show for many years back in the mid 1980s when The Disney Channel ran this show.  It came on weekday afternoons at 12:30 & weknights at 11pm & saturdays at 6pm & occasionally 11pm.I couldn't get enough of this sitcom.  It was pure escapism.  Ozzie & Harriet is absolutely timeless in its appeal to fans of 1950s nostalgia & those who enjoy classic comedy at its best.  I have always thought David was much more appealing & sexier than Ricky, & thought June was far more attractive than Kris.  I was a Dave & June fan every bit as much as an Ozzie & Harriet fan.  Just the overall chemistry between Dave & June & Ozzie & Harriet was great to watch.I thought Ricky was so cute & adorable when he was younger on the show.  I wanted to squeeze his cheeks.  I thought he matured into a very attractive man as he got into his twenties.  David was simply more sophisticated than Ricky, & that appealed to me greatly & still does.One of the finest episodes in this set that comes to mind is Tutti Frutti Ice Cream - In which Ozzie has this huge craving for Tutti Futti Ice Cream & goes out in the middle of the night with Harriet to try & find a place open to buy some!I also loved the episode, David & The Teenager, in which a young teenager (Bernadette Withers, Bachelor Father's Ginger) in Dave's building has a crush on him.  Dave's married to June at this time. It's really cute!  I don't see it listed in this particular set though, which amazes me as it's one of the best episodes in my opinion, & 100 shows covers alot of ground!  But this is still an excellent addition to anyone's library & boasts the largest number of episodes contained in any set for this particular series.Ozzie & Harriet is one of those shows you can watch over & over again & never tire of its magic & it's also the type of show that can even make you forget about your cares for awhile.  I highly recommend this set to anyone.  I'm prejudiced, I'm an admittedly huge fan of Ozzie & Harriet & have been for over twenty years when I first discovered it on The Disney Channel.  Actually, when I was a teenager in the mid 1980s, my folks & I briefly lived in southern california & I recall Channel 5 (KTLA) doing a holiday retrospective of Ozzie & Harriet at christmas time that I'd never seen or heard about again.  Does anyone at all have any recollection of this?Anyway, I'd first heard of O&H; then & had remembered about them a couple of years later  when The Disney Channel began showing reruns, which is when I became a fan of the series.I hope the entire series becomes available in season sets at some stage, however, I DO recall an article in an old Disney Channel magazine where David (who was doing his documentary, Rick Nelson: A Brother Remembers)was quoted as saying Ozzie was a perfectionist & critical of himself in certain episodes, which ended up being a list of about a hundred or so where Ozzie would make a note saying "Ozzie not good in this one", & those were the particular episodes that David said he didn't include in The Disney package when the reruns were showing because it was out of respect for his father, which of course is understandable, which means I would think, that maybe in a nutshell that is an answer to those of you hoping to see a complete release someday of all episodes.  I myself would love nothing more than to see all 435 episodes restored & released, but am wondering if anyone can shed any potential light on the possibility of this actually coming to fruition.Anyway FIVE BIG STARS for this OZZIE & HARRIET DVD set!!!P.S. Now, all we need is Here Come The Nelsons on DVD.  I've got the VHS, but there's a restriction against copying it to DVD, so let's hope an official release of this is in the works as well! :-)  I'm a big fan of the old O&H; radio series as well, needless to say :-)

$REVIEW.: Agnes is dying of cancer at the end of what one imagines to be late 19th Century, and is taken care of by her sisters Karin (Ingrid Thulin) and Maria (Liv Ullman), and the maid Anna (Kari Sylwan). This is one of the purest and most horrifying films I believe Bergman has ever made. A shade of the color red dominates throughout the film, and brings an immediate and naturally convincing mood. All actors contribute with a power and intensity, especially actress Harriet Andersson--whose pain as Agnes is very believable, even enchanting--and are more than well supported by the amazing camera work of Sven Nykvist. That the movie was shot on location in only six weeks shows that this is the work of a brilliant director, highly skilled actors and a professional crew.The Criterion disc features a 52-minute interview with Ingmar Bergman and Erland Josephson (who appears briefly in the movie), taped for Swedish television in 2000. Interviewed by Malou von Sivers, Bergman and Josephson discuss life, death, and love. Bergman, here at age 82, proves to be a down-to-earth and young-at-heart guy. The sound in the interview (surprisingly enough for a Criterion disc), distorts a bit, and can be quite distracting at times, but is not so bothersome that one wouldn't want to continue listening to what these masters of theater and film have to say (even if the topics barely touch upon their work and careers).Optional subtitles, as well as an English-dubbed soundtrack are available. The dubbing is surprisingly accurate to the picture, and is done by the actors featured in the movie. At times this accuracy may convince you that the movie was made in English. Still (despite this stunning surprise), I would suggest watching this in Swedish, as intended - at least the first time around.I watched this movie with a pair of good head-phones, in a comfortable chair, and alone in the dark at three o'clock in the morning. I recommend others to watch it under similar conditions - it adds to the intensity, and one can appreciate the intended mood of the film better if there aren't distractions. I seriously doubt that this picture will disappoint any true fan of good cinema.

$REVIEW.: Think of those wacky British comedies from the past, then think of Cheech and Chong.  Mix them together and you have this marvel- Saving Grace.  It is a very funny comedy that is one of the best pot comedies ever, right up there with the old C &amp; C movies and Half Baked.Grace is played by Brenda Blethyn, as usual a delight, who is a widow who is about to lose her house.  Until a gardener (Craig Ferguson from the Drew Carey Show, who also co wrote/produced this movie) gets her in a scheme to grow hemp in her greenhouse.  The climax is uproariously funny (the two tea drinking lades steal  they're scene) as well is much of the rest of the film.  Even if the there are some un-needed side plots, the film is must see.

 I appreciate that it breaks the DVD down into segments for those of us that only have a short time to work out, yet it allows you to play through it all continuously


 On my scale, I would place this DVD right next to, or just below Brian Kest and Mark Blanchard; all very similar vinyasa flow but Brian and Mark seem to push me a little bit more


I would consider my expertise level intermed-I have been ballet dancing for 22 years, and have been an avid exerciser all my life beyond dancing

$REVIEW.: I was never a big fan of ECW during its prime. When I first discovered it, back in I think 1995, I thought it was interesting because it was so much more out of control than the then WWF, but I was hardly consider myself a fan.This DVD however was interesting to me. Since there is no competition anymore, I wanted to see and hear why ECW was considered so great. Done with the DVD production that only the WWE can do.The actual feature is just shy of 3 hours, and is very involved. It goes into all aspects of the company and talks with all the major players involved. I really enjoyed the frankness that Tommy Dreamer, Taz, Bischoff, Vince and Paul Heyman all talked about the product. Many guys you can tell miss it. It was great to see a guy like Heyman, with such a vision and a passion to make his idea grow, and it takes a hell of a man to admit when it's over.This takes a look at just about the entire run of ECW from the inception to the first pay per view to the closing of it's doors and Paul Heyman emerging in the WWE. It is very hard to say how well this is all put together, but it is done really well.For true fans there might be things missing, but I personally felt that I now understand why it was so popular, and quite honestly after seeing it, you can see especially now how watered down the WWE is, not so much the wrestling, but the characters. You also can truly feel how influential they were in changing the style of wrestling and use of talent. A very gracious Rey Mysterio Jr. thanks Paul Heyman for being involved in getting his name known in the states.The DVD goes into history of angles, and how certain stories were told. To hear Heyman talk with such passion, this is a man that loved wrestling. You can tell he hates to see it go. If the WWE was smart this guy would be the top creative guy, he has vision, just don't let him near the money.Do I wish there was more? Of course. This could have easily been a 3-disc set. I wish there was more RVD and I wish more time was spent of Steve Austin. Chris Jericho talks about ECW, but unfortunately he doesn't get a match on the disc (maybe they'll put one on his DVD one day) As for the extras, well I haven't watched them yet, but I can tell you I would have enjoyed seeing a lot more RVD, especially the RAW match from 1997 vs. Jeff Hardy (I know that wasn't exactly an ECW match, but it was during the cross promotion era) I would love to have that match in DVD quality. Plus I think that at a mere 7 matches, that does not do justice to showing what ECW is all about. All in all an excellent DVD that satisfies the "Hardcore fans" as well as the uninitiated.

$REVIEW.: First, I do not like old classics re-made. They are their own entity. Ted Turner got movie enthusiasts up in arms when he started colorizing classic films. Although, there are exceptions. This movie follows the original nearly word for word. I feel it got closer to the old west as it was and not the John Wayne ( who I love) &#34;west&#34;. Jeff was the right actor. He is so varied in all of his roles.  Watch it!

$review_text.: Tom Berenger is the best US Marines sniper. He is competent and careful, and cares for the man who serves as his spotter. He has little patience with incompetence. He has seen people die because of it. He carries several dog tags of his spotters who were killed. He frequently plays with the tags as Captain Queeg did with marbles in the Cain Mutiny Court Martial, but not because he has a psychological problem, but because he feels this shows respect to their memory. Berenger plays his part well.So, too, does Billy Zane, a civilian who is assigned the task of being Berenger's spotter after his prior one is killed. Zane is an expert shooter, but has no experience as a sniper or spotter. Unlike Berenger, he has a psychological problem. Despite his ability, he is unable to shoot and kill a person. He freezes. While flying to meet Berenger, his helicopter is attacked by an enemy sniper. Zane has an opportunity to kill the sniper, but freezes. The man he fails to kill will soon be hunting Berenger and him when they enter the jungle to fulfill their sniper mission. This freezing happens again. Berenger tells Zane to shoot a man, but he doesn't do so. And, again, as a result, this man reappears later and tries to kill them. Thus there is tension between the two men.This is a well-acted action film filled with suspense: will the sniper team be able to fulfill its mission despite the strife? Will Berenger be able to save Zane? Will Zane be able to change? And, if so, how?

$review_text.: The frame of the moon, half shrouded in clouds,  resonates with us

As the human-canine quartet amble through the Ukraine, they travel not only through space, but through time

The tour guide Grandfather gets "lost," but somehow manages to pop up outside of Jonathan's destination
 He softens as he guides Jonathan, and we sense the trip also has meaning for him as well.The film is rich in imagery from the symbolism of sight, glasses,  and the seemingly farcical loss of vision
Then there are endless roads and change of scenery as we near the climax 



especially at night where the spirits live on

Even, Jonathan's collecting takes on added symbolic significance as the movie progresses.Giving away as little as possible, the film is the grandfather's journey

A Journey he is bound to complete, even as he hesitates at the `call to adventure.' His character grows, becomes more complex and withdrawn as he nears the climax
In retrospect, one could argue that he purposely delayed the journey to ready himself 






to steady himself from the ghosts of the past, burning in his memory.Make no mistake, this is a transcendent film
Like Star Wars or The Shawshank Redemption, its images linger on the palate like your mother's homemade ice cream on a summer day long gone.

$review_text.: Just what the hell was Demi Moore trying to prove here?  That she knows how to make a truly worthless film?  What could have been a daring, provokative movie is rendered hopeless by an inept script.  At least Ving  Rhames and Burt Lancaster are fairly funny.

$REVIEW.: As much as everybody else, I personally hate the idea of the Ultraviolet Blu-Ray

Yes, we can all agree on this


However, STOP RATING THE PRODUCT 1 STAR JUST FOR THIS REASON! The rest of the product is fantastic, and this movie is masterful! Stop rating the product so bad because of the Ultraviolet Digital Copy and enjoy the movie!

$SUMMARY.: WOAH WOAH STOP THIS!!

$REVIEW.: There's nothing quite like taking a universally important story, coveted by millions of people, and turning into a movie which makes millions of dollars


 The source material itself is really the only way I can rationalize its success

 The movie was not the "masterpiece" it was hailed as
 The camera movements were awkward, the editing horrid, the slow-motion unbearable, and the lighting was often too dark to even guess at what was occurring.The only thing this movie made me feel (and this is my personal opinion) is disappointment
 I was disappointed in human kind

 From this retelling of Jesus' story I realized how his name is used in vain every day

 Jesus' teachings went completely ignored
 We are no better today than those who crucified him

 Perhaps that is a bit cynical, but it is what I got from the film


 I felt terrible for Jesus because his death seems to have taught us nothing.And to answer the questions before they are even brought up, I was raised Catholic but decided I'd rather take Jesus' advice than the church that supposedly follows him.
