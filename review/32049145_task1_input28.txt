$REVIEW.: Staff Sergeant Heath "Ghost" Daniels ` closest partner is Trinity, his Special Forces-trained military war dog, until Trinity attempts to prevent his actions. Misunderstanding Trinity's actions, Daniels and Trinity go stateside after injuries in a bomb explosion. When Daniels gets the chance to return to the battlefields, even though it is only as a moral booster, he and Trinity go. Then circumstances, force them back into action.Great story, I enjoyed every minute. I admit I am a dog lover and I admire all of our military professionals, but the story captured my imagination and I found myself praying for the safety of the characters, a sure sign of my enjoyment. The characters and the story completely pulled me in. I could not put it down, part love story, part military story, and all dog. Highly enjoyable, I can not wait for the next one in the series. I recommend it for those who look for more in a story line than romance.Received Galley from NetGalley.com

$review_text.: This is a precursor book to the Wandering Engineer series. The author has a penchant for non-violent writing. In some instances, he is very good at this, but in others, the tale is lacking. In this story he falls short of his potential. This is supposed to be a precursor book that shows how the interstellar Federation was founded. Instead of finding an already developed interstellar colonization program, we find ourselves in modern day times. The plot line shows how we moved from being stuck on the Earth to colonizing the solar system. So the title of First Steps is correct but not the series title of Founding the Federation. The expansion that would be required to even think about founding an interstellar federation isn't even a twinkle in anyone's eye during the timeline of this book.For all of the misdirection in the titles, the story that is told, is entertaining although long winded in parts. I didn't dislike the book at all. It was just OK. I wasn't ready for the tale that was actually told due to the title. Bad on me for making an assumption. :) Overall, this book is OK. I can't really make a recommendation to purchase it unless you are a fan of the author and his style. In that case, this will suit your tastes just fine and should purchase it.

$REVIEW.: When I first started reading this book in the Amazon preview it seemed nice enough to make me buy it for my Kindle
After I read some more pages however, I began to realize that this won't be a quality read and it certainly proved that way

To give the author some credit, the story is interesting and captivating enough, and it kept me reading even after I realized I won't be getting sufficient satisfaction as a whole.There are simply too many flaws in the narrative
The characters (especially the main protagonist) have murky personalities at best and way too often act and speak inconsistently with their character sheets (if you allow me that D&D; reference)

Some situations were simply ridiculous and extremely unlikely if we summarized all the facts we had on the table so far


It is clear that the author pursued unexpected twists and turns in the plot, but achieved them at the heavy price of credibility and consistency of the characters themselves
I could not really define for myself who the characters really were, what borders would fit their personalities, and how would they act in a normally predictable situation
As a result I could not really believe the story..

and reading such books is all about belief, isn't it?All in all I would not recommend this book and I only give it 3 stars, because there actually is some good potential in the author

Maybe if the book had gone through several very serious reviews and had had put in it few more months of hard work, then the result would have been drastically different (for the better)


But right now as it is it simply does not live up to the heavy competition.

$REVIEW.: The best story in this book &#34;Scientific American,&#34; can be found elsewhere, so you don't need the book for that. The first story is pretty good, but then the rest of them fall into the style of what I call &#34;quirky for quirky's sake.&#34; It's sort of like people know that they're being all edgy, and so they flaunt that edginess, but it just ends up falling flat because its too obvious and self-aware. Ultimately, it wasn't compelling and it didn't really have any take-aways. Yes, some of the writing was very poetic and the sentence structure and ideas were, at times, interesting, but with no real value-add. If what I wanted was just something weird and pretty, I'd go to the MOMA and be done with it after a couple of hours. Kind of think that books have a responsibility to do more than that.

$REVIEW.: This is a good story even if it is sometimes confusing. I still haven't completely understood how all the abilities work or even the rules for the race they did.Shades eyes are constantly described are iceburgs in glaciers so I'm still not sure what they look like other than they are blue with white.Other than the weird eye description the writing is good. The characters are relatable and well written. There was just a few things that didn't make sense. Why didn't Olivia ever question anyone on why she was lied to about where her mom grew up? She also seems to know how some things work without ever being told about them.All in all its a good story with a unique plot.I was given a copy by the author in exchange for a honest review.

$REVIEW.: Awesome ideas
 In his captivating and humorous style, author and speaker Greg Wright gets straight to the heart of what a daughter, or any woman for that matter, really needs from the man in her life


 Raising his own four daughters, on "daddy dates", Wright speaks from experience


 He shows other dads (and teaches moms a few things too) not only the reasons why "daddy dates" are essential to raising emotional healthy girls, but provides numerous examples of the "how to's".He writes with candid honesty of how and why he started with the idea of dating his daughters


 His directness in addressing specific areas of his daughters' lives to get to know them better is refreshing.As a mom, I found the book one hundred percent on target

 What daughter doesn't need to feel super special?  Knowing that her daddy treasures her enough to go way above and beyond in listening to her, knowing her likes and dislikes, and just plain wanting to spend time with her not only helps to solidify her self-confidence, but shows her what she should expect from any man wanting to be involved in her life.I read this book in ebook format, but would love to obtain a hardcopy to pass on to my husband, and possibly my daughter too


 There is so much insight to be gained from the perspectives presented here
 I highly recommend Daddy Dates to every dad, mom, and even spouses.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze.com book review bloggers program

$REVIEW.: In Make You Blush by Macy Beckett, Joy has been looking for love in all the wrong places.  She is tired of the hook ups arranged by her politically driven mother and father that are all about image.  She is tired of being someone she's not.  When she seeks a little help from a cupcake baker/voodoo priestess then winds up in a tattoo studio, she finds Ryan who is &#34;Spiced carrot cake..with lots of sprinkles.&#34; compared to what she feels like is her &#34;vanilla&#34;.Joy wants &#34;...my outside to match who I am inside.&#34;  And Ryan might just be the man who can help her do that.  The attraction is immediate, the chemistry is sizzling - &#34;...they had enough chemistry to steam the ink off his skin.&#34;, and the dialogue is witty.  Ryan makes Joy feel alive, makes her feel like the person she knows she is deep inside...the one she's been hiding to be the appropriate, good daughter.  But she's still hiding from her parents, who she is and who she's seeing, despite the strong feelings Joy and Ryan share.Will Joy find the courage to be true to herself and Ryan?  Or will she bow to the pressure of a father who's not the same one she grew up with, pushing Ryan away and hurting them both?Macy gives us a fun, fast paced novella in Make You Blush.  Joy and Ryan captivate you and make you really hope they get a happily ever after.  They bring out the best in each other, and Macy's descriptives, smooth writing and easy flow will make you really glad you picked this novella up.Make You Blush is a prequel novella to Macy's new series The Dumont Bachelor's, an enjoyable introduction to the series that will make you eager for more.I highly recommend this novella to any romance reader, you won't be disappointed!

This is a different type of book that looks into the crazies out there


What I liked the most in the book is McCray did not try and make the stories longer with a lot of unneeded words

She also had a mix of long and short stories about Detective Nicole, Ruben and Kent


I really felt sorry for poor Ruben though

I can't wait to see where their adventures go.

Ingredients are affordable, and are mostly limited to fruits and vegetables, low-fat dairy products, whole grains, and lean proteins.

 Like all of his books, it is interesting and educational, with the protagonist here portrayed as an American Captain in the days of sail

 It is interesting to compare this with his Hornblower Saga

However, as the sun rose he could not leave her and began to burn.Petra watched as the distraught man laid a women's body on the ground. As she watched the women's body began to smoke and then the man also caught fire. All Petra knew was the overwhelming need to not let this man die.Growing up with the Shifters, Petra did not know what she was, only that she was different than the shifters. Will saving Synjon bring her closer to the answers that she's been wanting for so long?This is a short length story that provides the background for a future confrontation between Petra, Synjon, and the rest of the vampire nation as Petra seeks her father and Synjon seeks revenge for the death of the women he brought to the jungle to lay to rest. I totally enjoyed the character development and was really rooting for Synjon and Petra to get together. If you have read the Mark of the Vampire series, you definitely don't want to miss this short story.

$REVIEW.: On the surface Ben Bluman appears to be a normal person - someone you can trust and depend upon.  But Ben is not normal, he carries a demon inside him that bursts out when provoked.  When that demon is out, Ben becomes evil incarnate - no conscience, no control, no thought.  The story begins with Ben sustaining an injury.  He is found comatose and we are able to relieve his life through his dreams while comatose.  Are they real glimpses of his past?  Or are they just dreams?Ben Bluman was quite an intriguing character study.  You knew he was evil and yet at the same time, you realize there is something driving him to do these things.  He, himself, knows he needs medication and yet he still goes without it at times.  At times, he seems to revel in the catastrophes and tragedies he has engineered.  At other times he seems oblivious to what he has wreaked.Coma Sins is fascinating and makes you really wonder when you look at people in the world.  Perhaps Ben Blumen's life explained some of the tragedies we see on the news.  This is one book you will not want to put down once you start reading it.  An intricate web is woven for us to and the reader is ensnared in that web from page one.  Debby from Single Titles dot com

 The author tied everything into a nice tidy little bow with this last book  We still had the humor, the erotic romance, with some paranormal and suspense thrown in there for some fun
 I loved the paranormal turn that this series took and it's what set it apart from other erotic romances of today
 I was thrown for a loop towards the end and loved it


 I was like aha, I knew it was him and then was shot down, it wasn't him


 I loved that I was surprised and Ms

$review_text.: Since I was a little kid, I've never really liked princess Aurora, in fact I've always thought she was boring. But there are a lot of people on Goodreads who enjoyed this book, so I decided to give it a try. And it certainly didn't disappoint.In this sweet fairy tale story, Aurora travels around the world to escape from her evil aunt Maleficient who, we all know, wants to kill her. As the story progresses she meets lots of people, some really weird creatures, and she also finds her true self. Yeah, I know it sounds just like an average and ordinary story, but I really liked it. I think it's a good YA adventure/fairy tale retelling book; it may not be one of those books that surprises you with twists and turns, but it has so many characters that you will easily get attached to. So, Aurora Abroad is definitely a character-driven book, and kudos to the author for creating such wonderful and enjoyable characters!This book made me change my opinion about Aurora. She's not like the disney princess who falls in love at first sight. She is tough, and  not fond of romantic poems. I really like how she's completely oblivious to Lyric's feelings for her. The two constantly bicker and argue, and are just so cute together. Even though Lyric isn't really my type of fictional boyfriend (because he's too whiny), I think he's really perfect for Aurora. He's brave and kind. Well, not at first.I love how the author mixes tons of different fairy tale stories in this book: Rapunzel, Cinderella, Beauty and The Beast, you name it! This book has it all! So, if you love fairy tales you should definitely pick up this book!

The sizzle that is Cully and Jessa is AMAZING
Their romance was a lot of give and take, and it never felt like the author lost her pace with it


I'm so glad that I found this series, and I look forward to reading more by Patricia McLinn.

$REVIEW.: Sir Faucon de Ramis is named the king's new Keeper of the Pleas, a coroner, in Blacklea. His assistant is an obnoxious monk, Sir Edmond, who keeps Faucon gritting his teeth. Edmond seems to have things backward as he tries to give orders to Faucon, rather than the reverse. On his second day as "Crowner", the name attributed to him by the locals, he is called to witness the death of the miller in Priors Holston. At first glance, the death appears accidental but with some digging and help from another monk, Brother Colin, a medieval Columbo, the death ruling changes from accidental to murder. Many people are suspect as many people disliked the miller. Faucon seems to run into dead ends just when he thinks he is making progress in his investigation. The miller's death isn't the only one that needs solving; a child's body is found, unable to be identified due to the scavengers effects on her body. this is not the last we see of this type of murder. A very good book.

$review_text.: Welcome back Damon and Mickelle!  Celebrate the continuation of their story as the characters are delightful and the plot superb.  Nunes once again writes a brilliant novel where readers recognize that every choice and happening in life has a reason and meaning to learn and grow from.  For those who have experienced joining two families while trying to cheerfully attempt to work through the hurdles that come along with it &#8211; this book will definitely edify!I appreciate that much of the book was anticipated which made for an easy read with just the right amount of suspense, intrigue and conflict to provide readers with a sense of completeness once they reach the last page.  For those who have not taken advantage of the opportunity to read Nunes books I recommend you pick one up soon and experience the joy presented in her work.~The Book Stalker Reviewed

$REVIEW.: I really enjoyed the first installment, but with this book the crazy seemed to reach everyone, and for me that messed up the entire book. The storyline became fake and unbelievable, I wanted to flip to the end just to find out what happened at the end. The book started off good, but the characters were all crazy. Hardy wanted revenge badly on Zaria and still can't keep it in his pants, which once again turns out bad for him. There is supposed to be another installment coming out and I hope it is much better than this one was.

$REVIEW.: Burnt Promises (aka Home Wrecker II) is the continuing story of Brooklyn and Bo as they start to live their life together. Bo has asked his wife for a divorce and she seems to be dragging her heels as long as possible to stop Brooklyn and Bo from being able to live happily. It's told, as in the first book, from the perspective of Brooklyn and in little snippets as if you were on the couch with the character talking about her life. It pulls you in and makes you feel like you're her friend and you end up rooting for Brooklyn and Bo to find happiness and for the struggles they have faced, and will continue to face to end and to allow them to have some time together with Ruth (Bo's soon to be ex wife) from spewing her volatile anger at them both. Brenda Perlin has a way with words and a unique way of telling a story. Highly recommended.

It is basically having a diet plan where our body goes forward and burn fats instead of carbs

What I like about his book is that it is very organized, it has breakfast, lunch and dinner

 For each section, it has a list of recipes of food to prepare, exactly how much of each ingredient, and exactly how to prepare it


 I would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking forward to burn some fats.

When a mine explosion kills six miners and her father, Abigail is stunned. She is even more stunned when the owner of the mine refuses to give her the pay due, claiming her father caused the explosion. He also gives her three weeks to vacant the house.Nathan Hawk is the local livery owner and he was with Abigail's father when he died. But he is sympathetic when he learns of the blame placed on her father.Abigail decides to stay on in Calico, dangerous though it is, and work as a seamstress, while she tries to clear her dad's good name. But who is really behind the explosion? Why are they hiding it? And will the truth really set her free?LOVE FINDS YOU IN CALICO, CALIFORNIA is another historical romance set in a real life historical town of Calico. Now a ghost town, Calico has been restored as a tourist attraction by the owner of Knot's Berry Farms. I love these bits of information included in these books.The story, true to most books in the historical genre, starts out with death--and a lot of it--but Abigail is a sweet, compassionate heroine even as her world collapses around her feet. Nathan also is a wonderful hero, kind and considerate, and typically male as he tries to fix problems that arise.If you enjoy historical romances, then you will want to read LOVE FINDS YOU IN CALICO, CALIFORNIA. A fascinating note from the author is also included.

$REVIEW.: I purchased both the Boynton Family Calendar and this calendar last year and used them simultaneously.  I really felt the Boynton calendar was much better in terms of execution and space.  This Plan it Plus calendar was just too small.  If I needed to write more than one appointment on a given day, it would not fit in the little square and made the calendar look very messy.  The only thing I really liked was the magnetic strip at the top so that it could be hung from the Fridge which the Boynton calendar doesn't have.  Other than that, I would not recommend this calendar to any families who have more than one child.  I am curious though about the super size version which has recently come out.  I already purchased the 2009 Boynton calendar and am seriously considering purchasing the Plan It Plus super size 2009 version and compare them again.  Then maybe write a review on each next year.

$REVIEW.: I had no idea when I picked up the kindle edition of this book that it was considered "christian fiction",  otherwise I probably wouldn't have. (Not that I have anything against it,  just the name sounds boring and preachy, that's all!) There was nothing overtly "christian" in this book,  other than the morals of the character maybe.  This was the sweetest book,  a sweet,  clean, romance with the best charactarization I've read in a while.  The character Miranda, reminds me of the character portrayed by Rene Zellwegger in "Cold Mountain" - an absolutely hilarious, totally endearing and lovable, loyal, if a bit strange, girl.  And the villain in this book is the best bad guy ever,  completely repulsive, hateful...just his name,  Hiram Greene,  makes me cringe!  I was very pleasantly surprised by this book.  I picked it up because it looked like a light, fast read and because it was only 1.99 for the Kindle version,  there wasn't much financial risk involved.  This might be on my list of favorite books now.  However, one very annoying detail that should be disclosed is that this is obviously an OCR'ed kindle version,  which means that it is FULL of mispellings, weird punctuation and spacing issues and they can be distracting.  I figured it out pretty soon into the book and if you keep that in mind when you come upon a totally unrecognizable word,  you can get past it.  (for instance,  there is a character in the book named "Rose",  I think her name is only spelled correctly once or twice,  the rest of the time it is spelled with every letter in the alphabet OTHER than "R",  Eose, Nose, Pose, Oose, etc.)  Very very annoying,  but you can't lay the blame on the author or even the the author's editor for this.  Blame the slackers that translated the book!  Highly recommended despite all that.  Especially at 1.99.
$SUMMARY.: Perfect Cinderella Story! Who knew this was "christian fiction"??!

$review_text.: Very interesting first person story of a man who evaded capture on Guam for over two years.George was a 1st class Navy Radioman stationed on Guam at the start of WW II. He was one of about 400 sailors and 140 marines, and 200 natives. When the Japanese arrived and, most of the garrison surrendered after a token defense.George was one of six who went into the bush and did not surrender. George was fed and hid by the native Chomorros of Guam. They were very faithful to him and did not want to have him captured. Unfortunately, the other five were eventually betrayed and captured by the Japanese and executed. George spent the last 22 months on the island in an obscure hiding location under some rocks and by the cliff down to the sea. The Chamorro natives were wonderfully friendly and loyal to him. Early on he moved around a number of times to different places, and supported by different people as they were able.When the US Navy came to first bombard and later invade, he managed to contact a passing destroyer, and was rescued by a small boat. He was interrogated for intelligence, promoted to chief by Adm Clark.  He returned to Guam and looked up all of his friends who had helped him during is time on the island. He spent the remainder of WW II touring in support of the war. A wonderful human interest story.

$REVIEW.: Eating no processed foods is pretty much what this book is all about. The Paleo diet has been referred to as the caveman diet. The message is easy to grasp. Don&#8217;t eat empty calories. Meat, vegetables, and fruit. Fresh foods are the key. I never knew what bisphenol-A or BPA was until I read this book. This is a chemical in the lining of cans. The message being that canned foods are not a good thing. There are some motivational tips in the book as well as recipes to get you started. Since meat is part of this diet, they do suggest grass-fed meat, no processed meats. This is a lifestyle change, exercise and real foods to build muscle and lose weight.

$REVIEW.: Isabella West and Holt &#34;Axel&#34; Reid. High school sweethearts. Axel departs for the war right after high school, but Isabella is just starting her senior year. It's a classic start with a twist that pulls Isabella and Axel apart for over 10 years, but fate comes back and pushes them together when they've both been through agony without each other. He works for Corps Security and she's trying to divorce her abusive husband, so it's already a struggle for them plus this crazy chemistry that never left them to begin with.I love the way Harper Sloan writes. She's gets straight into each character's heads so well. A lot of authors write in two points of view but can't pull it off. That is not the case with this book. She can write the male perspective so well. She gets inside Axel and grips onto his emotions to show the reader that he's struggling just as much as Isabella.The supporting characters are great. I love how they each play their part. Dee. Greg. Mad. Cage. They are all so fantastic. And they're all supportive and protective of Isabella and Axel 100%. It's a great segue into the next Corps Security books which I will definitely read when I find time!Overall, I think this is a great book, especially for a first book in a series of amazing books! I definitely recommend this to everyone!

$REVIEW.: Knowing Lawrence S. Wittner's background and current position -- he's executive secretary of the Albany County (NY) Central Federation of Labor AFL-CIO -- it's no surprise that the blue collar workers at fictional  UAardvark in Indiana in  Wittner's "What's Going On at UAardvark?"  are among the heroes in the novel.Along with English professor Jake Holland, the university president's secretary,  Marsha Skelton,  and a few others, the maintenance workers at the school try to take over the place from the miasma of academia gone crazy.I reviewed Larry Wittner's previous book, a memoir of his decades in academia, "Working for Peace and Justice" about a year ago.  He's had an unusual career that's taken him from his boyhood in Brooklyn  to his earning his bachelor's at Ivy League Columbia College to  teaching at the Hampton Institute, an historically black college in Virginia  to an attempt to gain a tenure track position at ritzy Vassar College, to teaching overseas. With all this experience, plus his knowledge of academia, it's obvious that Wittner is well qualified to address the rejection of academic subjects by corporations at the nation's universities.Aardvark University was a typical state institution until major corporations bought much more than signing rights for just about everything at the school. Those familiar with universities realize that major donors at a school  get their names on stadiums, medical schools and performance centers.At UArdvark, the process has gone way beyond naming rights. Wittner provides a lively, irreverent tale of how an increasingly corporatized, modern American university becomes the site of a rambunctious rebellion that turns the nation's campus life upside down.Along the way, there are often hilarious encounters with a playboy university president with a fascination for miniature racing cars;  bizarre U.S. military commanders;  poetry-writing Hells Angels friends of the Jewish prof, Holland;  foul-mouthed, decadent students, an unusually avaricious corporate titan, gun-toting "Christian Patriots," a schizophrenic FBI director named J. Edgar Beria (the sensitive J for Jeffrey is fighting the hard-hearted Edgar);  hypocritical politicians (are there any other kinds?);  and a witch-like union leader who's actually green.Wittner's novel presents in a comic way what has become a serious issue in contemporary America: the corporate takeover of higher education. Having graduated from college in 1961, well before this movement, I found myself wondering if Wittner had exaggerated the corporate takeover.The academic who introduced me to Larry Wittner (whom I still haven't met in person), fellow Midwesterner Tom Hastings of Portland State University, has this to say about the novel:"Lawrence Wittner has channeled the spirits of Kurt Vonnegut, Charlie Chaplin, Woody Allen, Jon Stewart, the Serb kids who overthrew Milosevic, and at least two of the Three Stooges into this delightfully dystopic, comic novel. If you enjoy the bursting of pretensions and political pratfalls, you'll love this story. But if you expect our "betters" to be respected for the Superior Beings they believe they are, this funny little book is not for you."I was especially drawn to Wittner's op-eds because he's in my pre-baby boomer age cohort. If you have been on a college campus recently and noticed all the corporate signage, you'll see the truth in Wittner's satire.

$review_text.: The New Evangelization is the latest buzz phrase in the Catholic world. Everyone is using it, and it seems like there's always a new Catholic book being written on the subject. Ralph Martin addresses the subject inThe Urgency of the New Evangelization: Answering the Call, and Cardinal Wuerl also had his say in his bookNew Evangelization: Passing on the Catholic Faith Today. In one of his latest books, Evangelizing Catholics, Dr. Scott Hahn has decided to weigh in on the matter as well.The book is divided into three parts - The Call, The Response, and The Message. Part I - The Call goes into detail on what the New Evangelization is, including what it is; where/when it started and how its grown; how it is a Catholic reality; and how it is a mission for the whole Church. If you are familiar at all with the New Evangelization most of this information won't be new to you. It was interesting to read his description of three notable byproducts (read conversions) due to the New Evangelization. These three names are Abby Johnson (former Planned Parenthood worker, Kevin James (Hollywood actor), and Francis Beckwith (former President of the Evangelical Theological Society). Each came to the Catholic Church through different means, but all were results of the New Evangelization.Part II - The Response shows different models and methods in the New Evangelization. The first two chapters in this section look at the Gospels and the Early Church for lessons. Dr. Hahn says that the "blueprint for the New Evangelization can be found in the Gospels of Matthew and John. These lessons include - 1. Proclaim a Person (Jesus), 2. Proclaim by Words and Deeds, 3. Proclaim the Church, 4. Proclaim the Fulfillment of the Covenant, and 5. Proclaim the Sacraments. After these two chapters are my favorite two chapters in the book. Chapter 8 puts the emphasis on evangelization beginning at home, and I wholeheartedly agree. Even if you go to weekly Mass and send your kids to Catholic schools, it is still up to you to instruct your children in the way of the Faith. Chapter 9 explains the different between a ministry (reserved for clergy) and an apostolate (reserved for laity). He also clears up the muddy waters of the role of clergy and the role of laity. Using St. Paul's example of being one body but different members, he lets us know that is not the eye's (clergy) job to be an ear (laity) or vice-versa. Feel free to substitute whatever body parts you want for that example. The point is we each have a part in the Church, and we shouldn't overstep our bounds and try to do what is not ours to do.Part III - The Message talks about the subjects of sin, atonement, covenants, and love. In these chapters, Dr. Hahn not only lays out the content of the New Evangelization and puts it clearly that conversion is a lifelong process. There is no "once saved always saved." We must be ready evangelizers and ready to be evangelized. When it comes down to it, the New Evangelization isn't just about converting the "unsaved" but also about educating the faithful. The book closes with two realities - 1. everyone dies and 2. everyone who died lives on in heaven, hell, or purgatory. Where will you spend the rest of it? As with all of Dr. Hahn's books they make you think, this one is no different. If you have an interest in the New Evangelization, check out this book and the others mentioned at the beginning of this review.

$review_text.: Erik sent me "The Witch and the Sunflower Girl" for review. I honestly had no idea what this book was about before I read it. I hadn't read the synopsis and didn't look to see how many pages it was. The title was what interested me especially the subheading of `A Christmas and Halloween Fairy Tale'. I liked this story. I would say it's more a fairy tale for older children and up. A cursed kingdom and a fortuneteller seeking to break the curse is a creative twist on a classic tale. Erik created a very descriptive world filled with deep morals of hope, fate, free will, pasts and futures. I was nearing the end and wondering when the Christmas aspect would take place and when it did I wasn't quite sure how it happened. I understood that the fortuneteller broke the curse but I missed the definite how of it. It left me contemplating different interpretations and maybe that's a good thing, kind of like art and each reader finding their own meaning. Other than that the only other issue I had with the story was the use of the word lighted instead of lit (There I go again with the grammar) I give "The Witch and the Sunflower Girl" 3/5 stars. It was a good short read filled with great meanings.

$REVIEW.: This book is about two cousins named Beth and Patrick who go back in time in a time travel machine called The Imagination Station. They end up in Ireland and meet Saint Patrick who is trying to tell people about Jesus. They also meet the evil druids who want to kill Saint Patrick. The message is that we should not be afraid to tell people about Jesus. This book has lots of suspense,but the writing is simple and the book is pretty short.  I am thirteen and I liked it, but I would recommend it for ages 8-10. It also makes a good read aloud for ages 5 and up. I would also recommend the other books in the series. I read this aloud to my brothers who are 8 and 10 and my sister who is 5. They all loved it.

$REVIEW.: A very interesting family saga about an Italian American family with story-lines based primarily around the life of Serafina Conti-Vecchi, her parents, sister, brother, and later her son & daughter in-law. The story about her son and daughter in-law comes later in the book and is a remarkable tale in itself.The book begins when Serafina's father was still very abusive. I say still because later in life he comes to his senses. One of the most beautiful and yet intense areas of the book is when Serafina goes through the heart-wrenching pain after her boyfriend ends their relationship; his reasoning will shock and maybe even anger you. Only it really doesn't end there because she never forgets him for one day; this part of the story is most riveting, told in a way that brings the reader inside Serafina's heartbreak.There are numerous stories within the family members, some with surprises that will bring tears to your eyes and make you care and want to know the outcome.

$REVIEW.: There are times when selecting a book to read is a means of escapism, relaxing from the stresses of the times, and plunging into make-believe stories that absorb attention, allowing the reader to leave all else to take care of itself while simply entering into the realm of a well-wrought story. Susan Vaughan has a history of producing such escapism stories, tales she terms `page-turning mystery and romance'. She has a style, a large following and has acquired a number of impressive awards and prizes for her efforts - and her books have been translated into German, French, Spanish, and Icelandic! Having degrees from West Virginia University, Rice University and the University of Pennsylvania and having a long history as a teacher have brought her to the point where she can devote all her time to penning her specialty novels from her home in Maine.NEVER SURRENDER is the third installment in her series collectively known as the Task Force Eagle and it bristles with both suspense and romance - as well as plenty of well-written escapist mystery. Having read and enjoyed ONCE BURNED it is easy to slip into Vaughan&#8217;s modus operandi  &#8211; she knows how to immediately grab the reader&#8217;s attention and start the gradual free fall into suspense ably mixed with spicy romance. Vaughan opens her book with enough of a teaser that reading the brief plot synopsis will likely end up making the reader finish the book in one evening (it is a short one). To reiterate the author&#8217;s intro (she says it best) &#8216;When charming DEA Agent Ricardo Cruz has a lead in Maine to the cartel that killed his brother, his vanished suspect&#8217;s loyal sister, Juliana Paris, refuses to cooperate. Juliana&#8217;s determined not to fall for the sexy agent, but threats force her to accept Rick&#8217;s protection. Their hunt for the brother and the cartel&#8217;s American connection leads them into deadly danger &#8211; and into each other&#8217;s arms.&#8217; A bare outline, perhaps, but enough of a storyline to seduce. Vaughan knows how to mix enough Spanish expletives with copious use of contemporary style dialog to place the reader solidly in the middle of the story immediately. Susan Vaughan handles these stories like a pro &#8211; which she most assuredly is! This book is a must for Vaughan fans, and a great introduction for newcomers. Grady Harp, December 13

$review_text.: Luke 22: 19-20 "This bread is my body...this cup is my blood..." Stop and think for a moment, let Zola explain the Jewish perspective on such an odd and disturbing statement
It is a foundational part of the church, it is Communion

But what IS it?This 38 page booklet (in my original paper version) explains Passover, and then explains Communion in context

We in the church celebrate it regularly, but seldom stop to appreciate the Jewish context of the Passover feast as Jesus instituted the first Communion.As usual for Zola, the complex becomes clear and concise and the Jewish context of the early church is explained carefully so that 2 millennia later we can again understand the full meaning of what was done, and why it became a central part of Christianity.I encountered Zola about 30 years ago
I heard him speak just once in a small church in a small town

I've never looked at things the same since
I bought his booklet In My Father's House at that time, then this booklet a little later, and have enjoyed and been blessed by it ever since


Zola brought balance to the church
He taught the Jewish context of the church without edging off into the extreme positions of either Replacement Theology where the church replaces Israel, or the Hyper Messianic movement which lays the observance of the full Jewish set of legal requirements onto us


We were grafted in, not to replace Israel which still remains a separate entity before God and thru all time
Nor do we BECOME Israel

Again, grafted in, not replacing, not becoming the root that nourishes us

Zola brings that balance along with a fuller understanding of the Jewish roots that keep us fed by God.I cannot over emphasize the value of Zola and his gift for making things simple


As another favourite Christian author Dr
J


Vernon McGee once said--"putting the cookies on the bottom shelf" meaning that the truths of the gospel should remain accessible to all believers regardless of their age or mental abilities


The rule I abide by in teaching (Home School, Bible Studies and Sunday School classes) is that anything taught will be better absorbed, retained and used thru life if it is presented in the simplest possible form.I was so grieved to hear of Zola's passing a few years back


I got my Kindle the summer of 2011 and have consistently checked every few months to see if Zola's work made it to Kindle

I was so happy yesterday to find this here along with many others in his booklet series

It seems that only one remains to be "kindle-ized"
That is "The Signs of the End" and I look forward to seeing it soon.I am happy to say that whoever was doing the job of creating the Kindle version of these booklets did a superb job


The clickable table of contents works well in each book, the formatting and the text are unchanged, as is the cover art


Small details, but someone put loving care and attention to making sure these gems are perfect in their Kindle setting.I can't recommend them highly enough, 5 stars hardly covers how I feel about Zola's work


Don't despise them for their size or price

This one, and it's siblings are some of the best things you will ever have.And for those who homeschool as I did, please consider these to introduce upper elementary and middle schoolers to this content

I used them in personal Bible study with my children, and like McGee's stuff, these are so easy for the young to understand, that they are valuable just in that context alone.Simple concise teaching is a jewel
For pastors, teachers and Bible Study leaders, your students may not have the ability to grasp and retain long scholarly dissertations, but this they can easily absorb into busy overloaded stress filled lives

Ditto for personal study.

$review_text.: Grace Livingston Hill in her new book, "Not Under The Law" Book Eleven in the Love Endures  series published by Barbour Publishing, Inc. takes us into the life of Joyce Radway.From the back cover:  "She was paralyzed with fear...Who knew what desperate criminals these might be? Grave robbers would not hesitate to dig a new grave."In a moment of frustration, Joyce Radway walks out on her cousins, determined never to return and give into their selfish demands that she serve them rather than follow her dream of becoming a teacher. But in her haste to leave town, Joyce unwittingly stumbles on some men out to cover up their actions in a cemetery plot.Joyce is both stunned and afraid--especially when she recognizes her childhood friend among the men--but she narrowly escapes, unaware that as she builds her new life she's being followed.Ruthless and swarthy, Tyke is out to silence the only witness to his crime. His partner, Darcy, is out to silence the guilt that plagues his heart.  As their determined searches bring them closer and closer to Joyce, will God's law protect her against men who are a law unto themselves?When Grace Livingston Hill's first husband died he left her with two young daughters to raise.  In an effort to support her family she turned to writing.  However, Ms. Hill just didn't want to write just anything she wanted to write stories of faith.  Nothing blows up, there are no car chases and the future of the world is not in jeopardy yet "Not Under the Law" is very exciting.  Originally written in 1934 "Not Under the Law" is a wonderful story of how God can take our circumstances and change them to the better.  Joyce Radway has very bad luck.  Not only does she witness a crime but the they see her and know who she is.  Now they are out to hunt her down and eliminate her as the only witness even though she is trying to start a new life for herself.  The only one who is really going to help her get out of this is God.  How this story is all going to work out is what makes for really delightful reading.  I think "Not Under the Law" is a suspenseful thriller and a wonderful romance that will keep you reading as to what happens next.  Ms. Hill knows how to tell a great story and while it may be old it still is a powerful story.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Barbour Publishing, Inc.

$review_text.: Kola Boof has the widest writing range of any writer I know. Her book The Sexy Part of the Bible roams across a vast universe of human realization and a few things that haven't been realized yet. As it starts, you get a whiff of 21st century colonization, as white scientists seem to be cloning African people at their AIDs project. When everything's been stolen, they can still get your DNA! Eternity comes into this weird world as a clone with an incestuous father and a tranny mother (a well drawn character by the way). Since she's a copy of somebody else, Eternity wonders if she has a soul. She becomes a supermodel, hooks up with a rapper-politician (not to mention someone 2 billion of the world's people believe in) and tries to get over her fear of dolls. The doll fetish is one of the best parts of this book. Eternity is her mad scientist-father's doll, and as a model she is a doll of her own devising, a mannequin. Just when you're wondering where else this accomplished novel will take you to, Eternity finds her soul, and her destiny-- in motherhood. So this surreal swirl of scenes resolves into the most traditional story in the world-- the young person who goes out into the world to find their destiny.

This book didn't dissapoint, it contains interviews with many people around the world, each with their own story. There are interviews with people who don't have kids and love it, who had kids but wouldn't if they could go back in time, and finally people who had kids and enjoyed it (although these are the minority). I found this structure of the book, with plenty of insights from others, very helpful as it helped me to realise that there are so many like-minded people around the world!

$review_text.: There is no way that any Christian person with one ounce of Jesus in their life and heart could ever read this book. It's filth! The language, the explicit sexual scenes - again, it is filth and should not be allowed to be listed as Christian Fiction ON ANY WEBSITE!!!!!!! I paid good money for the book based on the synopsis. In no way did that synopsis ever state that the sexual scenes and the horrible (and I do mean horrible) language was in there. I threw the book in the trash and I will never purchase another one with this author's name on it.

$REVIEW.: I really liked this book.  I'm guessing it was targeted to a high-school female audience - teen christian chick lit, but I a woman in my 30s really enjoyed it. This story is about Bella Kirkwood, high school New York Socialite misplaced.  Bella is the daughter of a plastic surgeon to the stars (her Dad) and a professional woman of leisure and volunteer for elite nonprofits that is living a life of luxury - until her parents divorce that is. After her parents breakup, Bella's Mom meets a man over the internet and before Bella knows it they are getting married and moving Bella to a farm!  Bella is complete displaced in the rural area of the farm and completed out of her comfort zone with two "misfit" step brothers and a town of noticeably unfashionable people.Bella quickly gets off on the wrong foot and finds herself at the opposite end of the spectrum from the life she knows as most popular, most fashionable girl among her friends. God is definitely trying to teach Bella something, it's fun riding along as you're left wondering if Bella will every find the true nature of who she is and not just the pretty wrapping.The author injects a local mystery that Bella become entrenched in as a journalist for the school paper.  I really enjoyed this book, which was a great balance of christian influence, drama, humor and mystery.  Bella and the entire cast of characters was great.  I'll be eagerly awaiting the sequel!My only criticism, an very minor at that, is that the description says it is targeted for 9 - 12 year olds.  I'm guessing it is better suited for slightly older individuals - early teens I'd say.

$REVIEW.: I don't think I'd have the patience or endurance to try many of these techniques, so lets hope I'm well prepared for all my future remote hike/ camp expeditions.  I think I much prefer the lighter and steel fire starters with a flare for backup during very wet conditions.  I like to keep wads of tinder material in ziplock bags, so finding dry material isn't usually a problem.  Some of the techniques described I would have never thought of.  I guess a crisis IS the mother of invention.  What people can't come up with in a pinch!  Anyway, well written and to the point with a little humor thrown in.

$review_text.: I always get a bit wary when an author has a very popular adult series and then writes a Young Adult series that is related to that adult series. I say this because what usually ends up happening is that the author tends to dumb down his story in order to appeal to a younger audience. They then will rewrite the entire series in the perspective of younger characters to see the whole story from a different point of view. I don't really like this because they seem to think that the two audiences won't cross over and read all the books. Luckily for this case, Ted Dekker did not do this and gave his fans a whole other set of stories to enjoy.There's a lot of action in this book that makes the story feel fast paced. The characters are intriguing and well developed. Even though they are teens, they aren't juvenile in their thinking, probably due the circumstances they are in. I think that teens who like fantasy will enjoy this series because the story is written well and features characters that are of that targeted age group. I don't read a lot of YA fantasy so I don't have any books to compare it to but as a Dekker fan I think it will appeal to YA audiences. I've always felt that any of Dekker's books are good recommendations for YA readers but this one is specifically for them. For those that don't normally read this genre, I will admit that this book (and the rest of the series) is best for those who have already read the rest of the books in the Books of History Chronicles, particularly the Circle series. I have to say that if I hadn't read those books, I probably would not have picked up this series at all. For me as a non fantasy fan, it's very hard for me to get into books about other worlds so familiarity is always a good thing. Overall, I did enjoy the story and I'm looking forward to continuing my adventures of learning more about the Lost Books and furthering my knowledge about the Books of History.

How dare he! She resentfully goes along, hurling sarcastic remarks all the way, but, little by little, she begins to see the wisdom in what he's doing and the love he has for his family

I love every single character and how this is a story more about pack and family bonds than romance
Even though I KNOW there are strong bonds and feelings within the pack there is very little time for any of the relationships to deepen or become more complex
There are almost non stop problems


For every moment Brynn and Chase get to be alone they are quickly interrupted
Brynn's awesome kick ass best friend Lake is woefully underused

Devon absolutely steals the show and although I'm sure there is a Brynn/Chase/Devon love triangle looming in our future I would really love to see Devon and Lake together.This is an absolute must read for werewolf fans

Barnes writes were pack dynamics better than any author out there right now with the exception of maybe Kelley Armstrong but I wasn't too emotionally invested this go around

And I really missed my favorite character, Callum, who wasn't around much.

$REVIEW.: (A huge THANK YOU to Sara Mack for allowing me to read and review her book!)Guardian is the first book in a trilogy and starts off with a tragedy. Like most stories, starting off with tragedy is what encourages readers to read on. Well at least it did to me. And I must say I wasn't disappointed.Emma and James have always been close. Growing up best friends and then turning into lovers, they were inseparable and madly in love. When tragedy strikes Emma is left with a hollowness that cannot be filled or replaced. She drowns in depression and is content with staying locked in her room and not living her life. But then her best friend steps in and things start to look up a little.Shelby refuses to let Emma drown in her grief so she concocts a plan to get her out the house and keep her busy. They get jobs and hang out with old and new friends. But Shelby still doesn't reach Emma completely. She helps her forget for a little while but when Emma is alone thoughts of James consume her. Until they become more than thoughts.When James turns out to be a Guardian, a protector, Emma is ecstatic with the change of circumstances and begins to live her life again. But not really. She lives for her time alone with James in her bedroom and refuses to let him leave again. Even if she can't have him in real life she would settle for just having him near.But in real life there is Dane. Sweet, loving and funny Dane. What starts off as a friendship between the two quickly turns into much more for Dane. He really cares for Emma but knows that she will always love James and never open up to anyone else. He settles for helping her through her grief and maybe one day being able to find a place in her heart. But he's fighting against a ghost. One that refuses to leave.Throw into all the fried a psycho ex friend, Guardian will have you wrapped up in its pages.I look forward to reading on and finding out what happens. If I had one wish for future books it would be for Emma to learn to deal with reality. I know that many who read this will be okay with what transpires but to me its unhealthy and I would like to see her get better. I adore James but let's be real, he's dead.Anyways, what are you waiting for? Pick this up and check out Emma, James and Dane's story! Yes Dane because if you haven't noticed I totally adore him! :DHAPPY READING!!

$review_text.: One can readily discern the mental depth of RIO FOR PARTIERS 2004 by the illustrations on a narrow flap attached to the front cover. These depict &quot;some good (and bad) gestures&quot;, one of which, by a downward motion of a cupped hand, signals the question &quot;Did you get (sex)?&quot;This book, more than lavishly illustrated with high quality color photos, is an enormously attractive travel guide to hedonistic Rio de Janeiro. It's larger sections are dedicated to the city's hotels, nightclubs and bars, street parties, music scene, food, and outdoor sports activities - all of which are geared to the under-30 crowd. If I were single, three decades younger, and off to Rio for my first bachanal, this small volume (148 pages) is one I'd have in my backpack.Leafing through the pages, I was amused by the occasional contents, some of which are stated almost tongue-in-cheek. As examples:In &quot;What to Bring&quot;, some items are cheap watch, cap, sun-screen, disposable camera, and anti-diarrhea medication. Perhaps imprudently, condoms aren't mentioned. (Perhaps my teenage daughter should carry her own when she goes?)In &quot;9 Rio Commandments&quot;, one is cautioned: &quot;Most of Rio's slums are on the hills ... hillsides and mountains should be avoided like the plague.&quot; I guess skiing is out.There are several pages of nicely done street maps showing hotels and hostels offering discounts, of course, but also locating the likes of internet cafes, cash machines, drug stores (for those condoms?), and, in case you get lucky with the opposite gender and need immediate relief, after-hours motels.In &quot;Getting Around&quot;, when recommending against using buses: &quot;... crooks have been robbing buses,  and the mob sets one or two on fire when angry at the government.&quot; Hmm, and Californians only recalled Governor Gray Davis. Where's the passion in the Golden State?In the itineraries of several day-tours, a common element is &quot;check email&quot;. I guess to note the Old Man's response to the appeal, &quot;Send money!&quot;Intellectual pursuits, like, you know, visiting museums and such, are given short shrift. But there is the &quot;Tour of the Favela&quot;, which &quot;shows how many lower class Cariocas happily live in miserable conditions. A must for everyone.&quot; How droll!There are the sections &quot;How to Deal with Brazilian Boys&quot; and &quot;How to Deal with Brazilian Women&quot;.  The latter includes the assumption (addressed to randy male tourists): &quot;Should you catch yourself in a more meaningful conversation with a Brazilian girl, your next move is naturally to shag.&quot; (Guys, remember that hand gesture noted above when meeting up with your male buds.) For female visitors, but not the men, there's the section &quot;Beauty and Personal Hygiene&quot; that should amuse feminists. I guess the males of the species are expected to remain slovenly pigs.Lastly, in the extensive and mouth-wateringly illustrated food section, there's the sub-section devoted to &quot;Street Foods and Snacks&quot;, which includes a hamburger and cheeseburger. Now, this guide is obviously directed to Americans. So, why would a Yankee, surrounded at home by every manner of burger joint, want one of those?The back cover incorporates free drink and discounted food coupons at selected bars and eateries. Eat and drink till you puke, and have fun!Note: RIO FOR PARTIERS 2004 is apparently RIO FOR PARTIERS: THE TWENTY SOMETHING&quot;S GUIDE TO RIO DE JANEIRO (published in December 2003), but with a new cover. Both have the same ISBN, and, presumably, near-to-identical contents.

$review_text.: SPOILER ALERTI am shocked with how different Blake's story was compared to Jake's.  This book was a mess.  Piper was a horrible character. I don't feel sorry for her at all.  She lead Blake on the entire book. I was flabbergasted when she said she refused to lead him on, right after calling him at night crying and having sex with him??I do not appreciate how the author portrayed a soldier's PTSD in this book.  Instead of making him out to be such a bad guy, why didn't anyone try to help?? Try to take that burden away from Piper???At one point, I couldn't even feel sorry for Blake anymore. But at least he tried to move on, then was made to be the bad guy when he got ticked that she was pregnant.  Why did everyone think he'd accept her with open arms after having her ripping his heart apart?? And to tell him when and where she did, horrible.Then the only reason they got together was because she was pregnant?? Are you kidding me??This was a love story about a girl in denial that was selfish, and everyone made excuses for her.  And a male that couldn't say no and when he did, surprise I'm pregnant and now I will leave my other man who, oh yeah I'm engaged to!!I really like Derek's character but after this material I don't know if I will enjoy another story by this author.

$review_text.: "A Matter of Time: Volume One" has a great premise for a romance: a closeted, hard-boiled police detective protects a witness to a crime, and finds that he's falling in love with his charge. However, the execution of this idea is a bit, well, odd. The entire story unfolds in a most unrealistic way; time after time the characters act or react in a manner completely divorced from the way a person would in real life, and the plot doesn't progress in a logical fashion.As an example----Jory KNOWS people are actively trying to kill him, and yet he seems completely oblivious to the fact, incapable of taking even the tiniest precautions to protect himself---with the predictable result that he's constantly being pursued or shot at. But does this bother him? Not really---after each crisis he immediately goes back to his daily routine, only to be surprised when, whoops, the bad guys are on his tail yet again. This stupidity is rather frustrating, as is his complete infatuation with Sam the detective, because I don't think the author really conveys precisely WHY Sam is so irresistible to Jory. Sam's constant on-again, off-again mixed signals as he inches out of the closet get tiresome after a while. I can't even remember how many times these two broke up and got together again during the course of this story.Now, ordinarily this sort of disregard of reality would drive me crazy while reading a story like this. But in this case, for some reason I found the book to be very readable---I was willing to let go of my objections and just go along for the ride. An reviewer said that this book has to be taken as a "fantasy soap opera," and I'll agree---if you're thinking of it in those terms, and not as a slice of life, you may find that there's much here to enjoy.So, while my summary may sound rather negative, I still found this to be a pleasant diversion. It should be noted, however, that (as can be guessed from the title) this book is only half of the story; it continues in a second volume. And I think I'm curious enough about the plot that I'm willing to check out the second book to see how it all turns out. Oh, I'm not going to move the second book to the top of my Kindle wish list, but I do plan to check it out eventually.

$review_text.: This book, although it is short, is a breath of fresh air. There is so much passion between the main characters that it is hard to put this book down. I love Gabe and his bad boy ways, but he is also sweet and ever so charming. Elle, even though she is a bit of a goodie two shoes drama queen, finally lets her hair down, and what they create is wonderful to say the least.I loved the detailed love scenes, it was steamy and perfect. What more can a romance reader ask for? I would definitely read more books written by this author. It was right in all the right places.

$review_text.: As far as paranormal romance goes, "A Bit Of Bite" is packed with bite despite being barely a couple of pages. Set right in the middle of action where Ava, the sheriff of a town with its own population of supernatural is troubled by the serial cases of murder which implicated the alpha werewolf of the town, Julian, the werewolf she had a one night stand before and who Ava holding out flame for him despite everything.Due to the length, it doesn't provide a good medium for an overall character development as the romance have already started off-book and both of them are just sorting out their feelings with each other.By mixing light romance with a thriller in the midst of danger, so far the short story is enjoyable as a light reading.Already I was checking up the author's work especially her werewolves and vampire series. As far as kindle freebies go, this is one quality reading and a great introduction to the author's work.

Nice flashcard-like alphabet ebook with colorful illustrations. The illustrations are detailed and clear even on the Paperwhite Kindle which only has black and white images. This ebook is great for children who are learning about the letters of the alphabet.

$review_text.: Embrace Me by Lisa Samson is another jewel in Samson's crown. Valentine stars as the Lizard Woman in a travelling freak show along with her friend, Lella, the Human Cocoon. While it's not a great life, it's one that she has come to terms with until returning to winter in a small North Carolina town. There she encounters Augustine, a tattooed and dread locked monk, who shakes up her ordered existence with his talk of God and faith. Samson's books are not for those readers who want to be comfortable and comforted in their reading. Her books with self-mutilating pastors and chain-smoking characters make me squirm in my seat like a good sermon. She delves into topics and places few Christian books dare to go, and God bless her for it. Her books are not to be read lightly and tossed aside. They weigh on my soul and heart and never leave me untouched. Augustine quotes Mother Theresa: You only love Christ as much as the person you love the least. Did that make you squirm in your seat? That's what Embrace Me will do to you, make you re-evaluate the strength of your faith and love for God. Samson writes like no one else in the business; each sentence is carefully crafted and weighted. Read this book and be transformed within.

$REVIEW.: I read this book while deeply craving a road trip, hoping to find something appealing enough to convince my always-too-busy boyfriend (now ex!) to accompany me. Well, it heightened my general craving, but there was no one specific trip that caught my fancy sufficiently to even try to convince the boyfriend.First, off, this focuses much more on destination and much less on route than I like. It's not just life that's about the journey! I want a road trip with fun scenery, fun unexpected places to stop along the way, etc. If these routes include that, they don't say so in the text. Additionally, as another reviewer mentioned, this is light on map info.I think the other thing for me -- which I didn't realize before reading the book -- is that I'm just not likely to take a road trip on the other side of the country, and I would probably have found a regional book more useful. Even those in my region would require 3-4 days -- some significantly more -- and most of those could only be accomplished in that timeline if you were taking a break-neck pace.If you have a lot of time to devote to your trip, are more interested in specific destinations than general exploring, and feel free to go anywhere in the country, this is probably a fantastic book.

$review_text.: Having a medical background and also having a family member incarcerated, I found this book very interesting. These inmates that he is describing are the "norm" of the prison system. My family member does not fit into this category at all, but I continued reading without being sensitive; therefore.....leaving no negative comment. I found the section on the inmates who ingested items the most fascinating. Sure, there was some sarcastic remarks and name calling......don't we all think that sometimes? Working in the medical field is very stressful, so when you add prison on top of it....well, you can figure out the rest. He basically brought "the hustle" of inmates to the surface, so that the average person can understand prison dynamics. It is true......many inmates....well, it's all they know....how to hustle to get what they want. On that note, hey doc, can i get something for my bowels? very true. indeed.

$REVIEW.: As I was browsing Amazon the other day I came across this book again and was surprised to see the reviews.  I read it when it first came out and thought it was good.  Anyway, I sat down to re-read it and I have to totally disagree with the other reviewers.  I think people who read romance and erotic romance tend to want a happily ever after ending so when something doesn't go quite the way the expect, they give a book a bad review.  The truth of the matter is that in a polyamorous relationship it is highly likely that someone will get hurt.  Especially when the original two were having issues in their relationship before the third is introduced. While this is not my favorite book in this series, it was still a very good book.  I like Ms. Erickson's book as she writes characters that are believable and the situations are always outside the box.  While I feel for Erik's situation, I also know that Ms. Erickson will write his story and he too will find his happily ever after.  I highly recommend this book and think if you read it with an open mind you will enjoy it as well.

$review_text.: This is a collection of short stories in the Warhammer 40K Universe.  As a fan who has read many W40K books over the past 10 years, this book is underwhelming and very disappointing.  Am not happy having spent money for this book.The weakest and worst of the short stories is the opening, with Hell Night.  The author needs to study science and/ or military technology to develop a sense of realism.  The prime case is where the author has artillery moving closer in the attempt to bring down a void shield.  If the author had any form of education or knowledge in artillery, high explosive artillery rounds do the same amount of damage regardless of distance fired.  A high explosive round has the same impact and blast area when fired from 400-ft or 4000-ft.  Having the artillery move in closer to do more damage is not true or realistic.Another problem with Hell Night is the stereotypical side characters that do not enhance the storyline nor the W40K Universe.  An overzealous Commissar executes the Imperial Guard Colonel, but then gets incapacitated and has no role in the story's conclusion.  Yawn, we have read this before.  Worse yet, there is nothing sympathetic to really even care about the Space Marines in being legendary.  Wait, this is one wounded Space Marine who easily finds his way to the hidden sub-level and learns about the ghosts that haunt the region.  Wow, how a convenient and easy way to solve the mystery.Cover of Darkness is the second story and does present the heroic Space Marines in combat against a daemon that possessed a fallen Space Marine.  This story is a quick read but nothing really eye-opening.The Relic is better and faster paced story with the Space Marines fighting against the Ork hordes.  Casualties pile up and there is a slight chance that they will fail and Orks will triumph.Twelve Wolves is an excellent story about Fenris and the Space Wolves.  The story revolves around one Long Fang and one young Space Marine defending their fortress from a massive Chaos cult invasion.  The lore of the Space Wolves and strategy in defending their base is told.The Returned was ok, a story of testing of a returned Space Marines' faith and purity after being lost in Chaos held space.  Consequences story was a mere passing story on the trial of Captain Uriel of the UltraMarine series, very brief and disappointing.The Last Detail was exciting and engaging.  It tells of a father and son trying to survive a Chaos invasion of their farming planet.  Space Marines come to their rescue, but leave, thinking that the Chaos forces have been eliminated, or have they?  Really enjoyed reading this story.Orphans of the Kraken is perhaps the best story of the collection.  It places a handful of surviving Space Marines trying to rebuild their Chapter.  Salvation Teams enter dying/ dead Tyranid hive ships in trying to find possible survivors from a Tyranid invasion.  The action is interesting in describing how the hive ship exists.  The combat decisions are the focus here.  Is it better to retreat so that the few survivors can fight another day or to battle and die in trying to prevent the Tyranid spread?The Trial of the Mantis Warriors was boring and dull.  At Gaius Point is rather short, light on action as the story is more about the sins and decisions made in previously in combat.  Space Marines are not depicted as being legendary or heroic in this short story, however.Unfortunately, the strength of Twelve Wolves, The Last Detail, and Orphans of the Kraken was not enough to overcome the mediocre and underwhelming writing of Hell Night, Mantis Warrior, and Gaius Point.  Can't recommend buying this book.  It is better to just read specific short stories from the library or bookstore instead.

Angelika Helsing draws you in with three-dimensional characters who have real lives, real problems, and burning desires suppressed for realistic reasons.

You yearn with their yearning.  And when she takes you to the brink, you don't just fly, you soar.  CATWALK is a book you'll read more than once, while you're waiting for Ms. Helsing's next book.

$review_text.: Though you can't argue with Stanley's approach to the one-point-sermon as being an effective way to communicate, the book brings up the Biblical illiteracy issue in the American church
 Stanley favors preaching on passages that have more application to people's lives than treating the entire Bible worthy of presenting from the platform
 At some point people are going to open their Bibles, I hope, and find stuff in there that they have never heard from the pulpit
 There has to be a push to get people to study on their own, and in groups, so that they know what this book says that they are basing their eternal destinies on.

$review_text.: Tim Downs graduated from Indiana University, where he created a comic strip entitled Downstown, which eventually entered syndication after he published three collections based on the comic strip
Downs also founded "The Communication Center," a training and consulting arm of the "Campus Crusade for Christ." Downs garnered a Christy award for his novel PLAGUEMAKER

He also authored CHOP SHOP and SHOO FLY PIE, as well as FINDING COMMON GROUND, a non-fiction book.Dr


Nick Polchak, better known as "the bug man" is on site with a branch of FEMA called DMORT


Their mission is to collect and process dead corpses amidst any national disaster


Hurricane Katrina has hit, and Nick teams up with his buddy, Jerry Kibbee, a funeral home director from Fort Wayne, Indiana


Although their mission changes from the beginning of this deployment, Nick is still painfully aware that Hurricane Katrina would provide an excellent dumping group for corpses who met their deaths by illegal means


Sure enough, he quickly finds a corpse that fits that category and opens up a can of worms

This seems to be Dr

Polchak's forte, and he is better than anyone at defying authority
When they find a second body, he is in trouble with higher ups:"'Yesterday you recovered the body of a man from the Lower Ninth Ward, though you were specifically instructed not to

Last nigh your director reprimanded you for that infraction and reminded you of your instructions - yet today you recovered a second body from the same general area
I'd like to know why.''I'd like to know who's asking,' Nick said.'My name is Turlock,' he said


'Special Agent Frank Turlock.''Why is the DEA interested in my little faux pas, Mr

Turlock? Seems like an in-house issue to me.'"Tim Downs is once again at his best with this installment of Dr
Nick Polchak the bug man's adventures

Polchak strikes a character rich balance as a wise-cracking entomologist, a man who would rather study bugs than try to communicate with his ex-lover psychiatrist, who is also on-site for Katrina

$REVIEW.: Shadow Animals is a novella of dark fantasy. It's quite different from anything I've read from this author before.Imaginatively written world-building sets us deep into the woods of New Mexico in the Copperton forest. An area not fully mapped to this very day. There, our protagonist, Saul, is searching for his lost son Ephraim. During his journey, Saul encounters beings never before heard, or thought of, a town unreachable by any normal means, and help from an unexpected source. That's all I will say about the plot.I enjoyed the character of Saul and I liked Koryn as well. They were believable and the author had me caring for them both quite a bit. I loved the imagination shown in creating Ji/Ja, but  I would have liked to have known a little bit more about how they(it?) came to be and the town/environment in which they lived. Perhaps this is something I can look forward to learning more about in the future? I hope so!The only other issue I had was that the novella ended rather abruptly at 82%, which left me wanting.Overall, I thought this was a creative piece of work that I enjoyed and would recommend to fans of dark fantasy and horror. I am hoping that there will be more stories set in this world in the future, because this novella could be the bare bones of something truly wondrous.*I was provided a free e-book of Shadow Animals by Horror After Dark (Horrorafterdark.com) in exchange for an honest review. This is it.*

$review_text.: This story was almost a DNF for me. It dragged on and there seemed to be a nonsensical plot of the town fathers that didn't connect to the primary story of Laurel's disappearance. Ben, the tortured hero, wasn't particularly believable because the presented story only eluded to why he felt broken. He seemed to have taken his experiences on the Windward too personal. I understand that his sister was killed but his guilt seemed more about the others than her which was quite odd.The final sex scene was very disjointed because it didn't explain how/why Ben restraining Sage proved that he was the same man as he was pre-Windward. Another odd thing! And I'm sorry, duct tape is not sexy in any capacity.It took me a week to get through the story because I didn't connect with it or it's characters at all. Unfortunately, there just wasn't enough in this story to make me want to continue with the series.

I absolutely loved both of these characters as well as the side characters. I can't wait to read Shayne and Lacey's story.

$review_text.: My wife was diagnosed with type one diabetes shortly after we were married, when she was 30 years old. It's been five years now and I feel like I still don't have as good a grasp on the disease as I should if I'm going to be a big help to her. So after hearing an interview with the author on the radio, I decided to read this book in order to learn more about the disease and what the prospects are for real life changing treatments and cures for my wife. I also wanted to lean more about the origin of the disease and how best to prevent its manifestation in high risk individuals, seeing as how we have recently had a son who so far has not shown any signs of having it.I thought the book was fantastic and I promptly made my wife read it (in order to give her some guidance and hope) as well as my parents and in-laws so that all involved in her support system would have a better idea of what we were up against. The book laid out in an easy to understand fashion, the biology and history of the disease, as well as the possible controversial causes, cutting edge treatments and outlook for future cures. All told, the book was very hopeful that a cure or "cure like treatment" could be possible within the next 20 years. That may be in time to save my wife's life and the lives of millions of others. The book also laid out a plan of action to avoid contracting the disease for those who may be genetically susceptible to it. That is extremely valuable to me as I try to protect my son who may be at risk due to my wife's genetics.I highly recommend this book not only to those who already have diabetes or have a loved one who does, but to everyone else because this disease is spreading at an alarming and unprecedented pace and can strike the perfectly healthy at any time. People should be aware that it's out there and know what to do to avoid it because once you have it, your life will be changed for ever.
$SUMMARY.: Informative, easy to understand, and hopeful

$review_text.: What would happen if you couldn't control your fire? Well that is if you were a dragon. This is a serious problem Little Dragon had to deal with. Once after being so frustrated, Little Dragon ran into the woods, just to get away. He ran and ran. And ran. While in the forest, he started meeting friends. First it was Shelley the turtle, then Betty the bird, then Barney the beaver, and on it goes. Each of Little Dragon's new friends loved his fire, and encouraging him, telling his it was his gift. As with Little Dragon's gift, the other forest friend each had their own special gift that they shared. Read this wonderful book and take a trip to this forest of gifted friends.In "The UnHappy Little Dragon," Carolyn Wolfe writes a wonderful story to teach young readers that they are special, no matter how different they are. Using the animals in the forest helps teach children to feel differently about their fears and disappointments. Carolyn Wolfe has a special gift herself in writing stories like this to teach valuable lessons to her young readers. And the illustrations are adorable. The Little Dragon and the forest animals have a sweet childish personality, with colors that invite you in the pages. I highly recommend that you grab a copy of this beautifully written and illustrated book to read to your child.This book was provided by PUYB for me to read and review. I was not required or expected to write a positive review. The opinions in this review are mine only.

$REVIEW.: My husband and I had the privilege of meeting the author and her partner at a bed and breakfast in North Carolina.  We all live in the mountains, but not too close to each other. We're all fairly new to the Appalachian mountains, and still finding the people very nice although they can be a bit quirky. Or just perhaps different from the people we're used to in our home states.We enjoyed talking to the couple over our breakfasts and enjoyed their company. As soon as I got home I ordered her book and really enjoyed it.  Her observations about the people she has met in NC are funny and on target without being disrespectful.  A very funny read.  Buy it!

$review_text.: Eternal Warrior Tpb vol 1: Sword of the Wild collects the first four issues of Eternal Warrior.  It is a great collection that tells the story of how Gilad the Eternal Warrior came to surrender his duty as the fist and steel of the Earth as well as the relationship between himself and his two children.This is a great re-imaging of the original Valiant character.  The similarities are there but there is a few differences, most notably being the introduction of his son and daughter.  The stories are a bit complicated but after a second read of the issues it becomes easier to understand.The writings of Greg Pak again are a bit complicated but worth taking a second read.  What stands out is the art.  There are two artists on this book, Trevor Hairsine and Clayton Crain. Hairsine pencils the present sequence  while Crain pencils the flashback sequences.  While I prefer Crain&#8217;s pencils I think that both Hairsine and Crain are great on this title.  As usual, scans of the variant covers are included as a bonus in this paperback, which are always favorites of mine.
$SUMMARY.: Great read!

$REVIEW.: *Warning*: This book is DARK. It contains abuse, rape, drug use and violence; not a butterfly, unicorn, or rainbow in sight."I fell asleep that night in the arms of a killer. I'd never slept better."I adore this book; even in all it's darkness and senseless violence, and in it's hopeful, but slightly twisted romance. Love is a small thing of beauty in the ugliest of circumstances.Abby and Jake are broken. Past abuse and tragedy had left them unable really love, or so they thought. When they come together, it's electric. This couple BELONGS together. Never mind that they just met and everything is all wrong; they make you believe that they can make it work. Jake is sexy, dark, violent, and even funny. He shows his soft side around Abby, but always maintains that alpha-male persona. Abby's past has left her numb, never accepting touch or love, and afraid to show herself to anyone, inside and out. But she is strong; often beaten but never quite broken. Abby and Jake are wonderfully realized kindred spirits, and they have genuine, simmering, palpable chemistry. This couple kept me glued to the pages, wanting more of their complicated, emotional love story. It is impossible to judge these two on a scale of right and wrong. They exist in a grey area and do what they must to survive and to try and find peace, but that peace is not easily granted.This is Jake and Abby's story of acceptance, healing and heartbreak, but also so much more. The story as whole developed in to something I never expected and I was constantly surprised. Moments of happiness were suddenly shattered and the characters' actions and reactions kept me guessing. When I was hopeless and lost, the characters found a way to pull me from the depths. The writing is gritty and raw, but beautiful and entirely engaging.After all of the tears, anguish, and heartbreak, I finished the story with a smile on my face and I'm not sure how I feel about that. Jake and Abby's (sort-of) happily ever after does not come without a price. Darkness and light, hell and heaven, violence and love, redemption and revenge fight for balance in this book. This haunting, dark romance is a fantastic read."We were just us. Broken and bruised. F***ed up and messy. And together we were everything we never thought we could be."This review and more at TattooedBookReview dot com

$review_text.: Being a History teacher and a military enthusiast, I have been on a quest to look for naval battles, especially for World War II.  I found the naval wars around Guadalcanal to be one of the most fascinating and intriguing periods of the War in the Pacific, especially against the vaunted strength of the Imperial Japanese Navy.  It seems that America too had a tendency to underestimate one's naval opponent.  The Japanese underestimated America's will to fight and see a conflict through to the end.  They envisioned Americans as spoiled Playboys, fast-car drivers, fast-women chasers.  Therefore, the inflicting of losses at Pearl Harbor and the belief that American gangster politicians would listen to American mothers preaching pacifists ideas.  So, if their sons got a bloody nose, it would surely grant the Japanese the ability to make a major grab for adding more territory to their ever-growing 'Co-Prosperity Sphere' in the Pacific.Well, they made a major miscalculation on their part.  Americans didn't throw in the towel, but fought back hard in buying time for our industries to gear up for war.  Coral Sea and Midway threw a major monkey wrench in their timetable, but they still had the power to throw their surface fleet around and push the Americans off the high seas.  Or, so they believed that that would be the case around the waters of the Solomons, and especially the near the island of Guadalcanal.That was not going to be the case, as the true turning point, after Midway, was the campaign in and around Guadalcanal.  It was in the waters of &#34;Iron Bottom Sound&#34; and &#34;The Slot,&#34; that the slug matches erupted in those night engagements, at nearly point-blank range.  Once again the American misjudged their own ability and ships against the Japanese and their ships and weapons.  It was a rude awakening that the Japanese were excellent night fighters.  It was extremely rude in finding out that the Japanese were about to have their way with their so-called &#34;Tokyo Express&#34; slipping down the &#34;Slot.&#34;  It was a devastatingly rude awakening when the Japanese torpedoes could reach out and touch American warships at extreme ranges.Overall, this book adds to the mystic and heroism that comes forth in the battles around the island of Guadalcanal.  The stories, the pictures and maps add a great deal to the character of this book.  Individuals who are interested in this chapter of the war at sea, in the Pacific, will enjoy this book.  I highly recommend it to navy historians.One should realize, as one reads through the pages, a great deal of gratitude should be paid to these Americans, of the 'Greatest Generation,' for their duty and sacrifice made to keep this country free.  After all, the Imperial Japanese Navy and the sailors and officers were formidable opponents.  Since this operation was conducted on a 'Shoestring,' things were touch and go throughout this campaign.  One should take note that, &#34;Freedom is not Free.&#34;  Hats off to those veterans of World War II who defended this country.  Go Navy!Ben Lineberry

It's a spin-off from the Mr White Series

Although I see it's recommended you read the other books first I haven't and I can honestly say while reading this I didn't feel I was missing anything by not reading them.The sexual tension through the first part of this was amazing


I've not read many M/M books so I thoroughly enjoyed it.This story had lots of lovely factors that I enjoy in a book
Love, family relationships & the sex:)I found this to be a lovely easy-reading romantic story with a brilliant ending
The last few pages is not what I expected...


It was better than I expected.The author did a brilliant job on this story

$review_text.: I looked up the Author to see more of his books, but not too much information out there.However, this book is an epic, following the monumental years of a 3rd son of an old, landed gentle family. It describes thoroughly the values and virtues of that period in England, but with from a male voice as a gentleman of good breeding but no expectations must lift himself up.More than that, it is Regency realism. While authors of that period avoid the vulgarity of spelling out situations explicitly, Shotwell is able to cross the social censure and his characters struggle with issues of premarital sex, pride, classism, sexism, slavery, filial duty, compassion, spiritual peity, and even animal cruelty. All of this set in a panorama of Regency countryside beauty.His prose style is direct, rather counting on strong descriptions to paint the image. His characters are very rich and have depth, each one unique and have opportunities for redemption. There is not the same tension of Jane Austen's style, but there is a lot of adventures, dramas, and tear jerkers. Also there are moments of brilliance that connect the story in a poetic way that is a treasure. There is a lot of spiritual interpretations of Christian values, so this book is ideal for anyone looking for spiritual inspiration made simple. And the descriptions are rich in the lavish lifestyles that one can be born into and lose within a lifetime.Must read.

$review_text.: Have you ever picked up a knitting book and said "Ooh, I like that, and that, and that.."? For me, this is one of those books. You start flipping through it and are instantly captivated by the wealth of lovely designs. Many of these are admittedly on the more romantic side, but not too sickeningly sweet.What you'll find inside this book are feminine styles that will weather the seasons, the theme on which this book is written, very well. There is very little here that I wouldn't have worn five years ago and that I wouldn't wear five years from now. And when you consider how long a book might sit on your shelf before a pattern inside it works it's way onto your needles, this is a very valuable feature.The pattern range is very reasonable, I'm a 2-3X top depending on the manufacturer and I fit into the high range of most patterns here just barely. I wish the sizing went up just a tad bit higher, maybe into the low 50's vs. 48 or 49. What's commendable about the book is that many of the styles WOULD look flattering on a plus size woman.I would be remiss if I didn't talk about the inspiration part of the book. The workshops help you think like a designer and really give you some insight into how you might fire up your own creativity, whether with these patterns or any others. I like how the little sketches that go with each pattern show you how the pattern started, but it may not have ended up looking quite like the finished product. Several times I've looked at the sketch and thought, 'ooh, I'd do it that way instead if it were me!'Lastly, I'd like to add that at my knitting group the book had a huddle of women looking over it ooohing and aahing. Sure sign of a winner!

$REVIEW.: As in title this book is total bull.Book contains of five parts:1. How genius you can be (and author is) and how much money you can earn2. What are options3. Making money on spreads and condors4. About Elliot Theory5. Making money on index trading.What is wrong about those partsAd. 1It is just for writing anything. It doesn't have anything to do with rest of book and is of no value. But OK, lets say it can be acceptable. Book is thicker and easier to sell. And it makes you wanting to read whole book and invest like author.Ad.2There are few pages about what is option what are Greeks etc. Such knowledge is to be found and obtained online in five minutes. And those are only basics - if one want to be option trader one have to have much more knowledge.But lets say again OK, it can be acceptable.Ad. 3Making money on spreads and condors.Author many times says how simple buying options, buy & hold and directional trading are for suckers. That it is only loosing money.But in later parts author says that is using simple averages and buying when trend is up and selling when trend is down. Isn't it form of buy & hold? Isn't it directional trading?Author present some examples of spreads and condors. Says that you can earn money in 80%-90% of cases.Spreads in examples can give you about 150$,  while you can lost up to 3000$ on them. It is beautiful to earn 150$ every month but what in month that you lost? Whole 3000$?Author forgets to mention that it is probability. You can earn 150$ 90% of  times but finally you ALWAYS hit month with 1000$ or 3000$ loss. What than?There is one sentence about it - buy back the spread if it goes in wrong direction. But there is one problem with it. Those are credit spreads. In moment it goes in wrong direction you starting loosing money on it. In very most cases you won't be able to buy back it without loosing money.It's all based on probability. If There is 90% chance that your spread will not loose money than it is priced such that you earn 100$ 9 times and loose 900$ next time. In long time you will win the same amount as you loose (loosing transaction costs in addition). It is because options are priced based on volatility, and author is using the same volatility to determinate chance of winning.The same with condors - it can be good on flat markets, but than option will be priced according to flat market and money earned will be very little compared to possible money lost. And in long term you may win few times but it is SURE that eventually market will move somewhere and will no longer be flat. And in that moment you will loose what you scraped for previous months.There are no solid data - % of winnings, win/loss ratio etc. Just few charts and examples. I could find proper chart and example to anything. In such way I could even proof that markets are connected to flowers on my window and average return is connected to average number of leafs on my flower.Ad. 4Again - few pages, few charts. No solid data. If I'd like to know about Elliot Theory than I will go to proper books. And why this theory is described at all? Author is not using it in trading so why describing it?Ad. 5Many place about how author earn plenty of money using two simple moving averages. Again no solid data, just few pictures supporting idea.SMA's were good for turtles in 1970's, now 40 years later markets are a bit different.Again there are only few examples supporting idea, but what about all wrong signals? There is one sentence - better to be on market and loose than not to be and not earn. Maybe. But without any win/lose, draw-dawn etc. it is pointless. I could prove anything that way.Nearly last - author prefers to use ETFs with multiplied ratio. That means that when market moves 10% ETF is winning (or loosing) 30% instead of 10%. Author says that way you earn more. Probably true. But that way your draw-dawns are 3 times bigger. Would one be strong enough mentally and financially to survive that? There is no way to know because author didn't present any numbers. Besides if one can earn month after month that way than why use multiplying ETFS? You will earn the same with usual ETFs, it will just take a bit longer. But how much safer.Author just maintains that he earns much more than mutual funds and market. And how mutual funds managers are suckers and should be charged of loosing money.But lastly - there is one immortal sentence - that author does not guarantee that you will be able to earn in future using his methods....OK, just for ending.I think that this book is very dangerous. It describes few option and ETF strategies, but did not present any solid data how those strategies work in reality.I don't recommend this book for beginner because it is simple way to loose money, and advanced traders won't find anything valuable here. Even advanced traders will loose money just by buying this book.

$REVIEW.: Naked on a Treadmill is a humorous book about a man who has pretty much had his soul sucked out by the corporate world and decides he can take no more.  Having become comfortable in the never surprising cubicle world Chris begins to slowly step out from behind the cubicle and quickly gets into gambling debt.  Hilarious situations arise in his attempts to get out of his self-made debt which keep the book moving and entertaining.  If you have ever watched shows based on what someone would do for money and enjoyed them...you will love this book.  I found this book very funny and a light read.

$review_text.: 4.5 starsBRIEF SUMMARYOn the night of Lydia Trent's betrothal, she is extremely excited with whom she is engaged to, Marcus Russell. After their engagement, Marcus leaves never to be heard from again until six years later when he receives Lydia's letter requesting that their engagement be dissolved. Upon receiving this letter, Marcus is determined to show Lydia her mistake with her request.THOUGHTSThis was an exceptional work of historical fiction by Victoria Vane and I can also admit that I was extremely entertained by the author's dialogue between the main characters, Marcus and Lydia. Within the novella, the author manages to give us a bit of plot, spicy scenes and likable secondary characters, which helps to build more appeal to the main characters and storyline.The story starts us off with the announcement of both Marcus and Lydia's engagement, which then has Marcus leaving immediately after. Fast forward to six years later with an itchy, frustrated and unwed wife to be, Lydia. The moment both Marcus and Lydia reconnected, immediately had me bursting with excitement, starting with their letters to each other as Lydia requested to void the contract. As short as there letters to each other were, it was entertaining. The fact that Lydia did not make it easy for Marcus after six years was a plus for me as well. The other key moments for me personally, was the moment Marcus saw Lydia again after six years and the build up of their chemistry leading to their intense moment with Marcus bringing tea to Lydia's room. That moment ignited everything. With Marcus' comments and determination to have Lydia, I found myself wanting more of him and with Lydia's determination to pull away, had me engaged while everything unfolds. The epilogue and the last few sentences were amusing and left me with a smile on my face.Another pleasure to read was Nicholas and Mariah. Nicholas is Marcus's best friend and Mariah is Lydia's cousin. With the brief time of getting to know them, I was also drawn to them and can honestly say I don't mind reading a story involving both characters.Length: Novella 100 pg.Storyline: GOODEnjoyment: GOODIntimacy Level: VERY SPICYRomance Novel Junkies

His sister, Lucia is haunted by the Black God, who waits to see Lucia confront an impossible decision.  I found this book hard to read.  Although the plot was interesting, the characters seemed flat and stereotypical and I had a hard time becoming invested in them.  I am interested to see how this author develops in the future.

$REVIEW.: What can I say Kimberly knocked it out of the park with this one. When I found out she was writing another book I thought how could she top Brandon & Spencer, but she did. Easton & Brooke's story is all about second chances and boy did they both deserve it. I hated E at the beginning but fell in love with him so fast such a broken sole that needed fixing. Their journey to find happiness is such a emotional struggle you will hate what E has done in the past to shape who he is today, but that one chance he took made him who he is now. Brooke such a sad person trying to move forward day to day just goes with the flow type of girl. The once chance meeting led to true happiness has its ups and downs its not always pretty or hearts and flowers but the way Kimberly wrote the story has you feeling that you are right there with them. I laughed and cried wanted to throw my kindle at times but it was so worth it..... Great story and I cant wait until the next book..

Not only do you get more of that oh so yummy Ryder know ( be still my beating heart) but you get the dominating Harrison. Yes, yes, we all dislike him well I know I do he has some issues and I don't like the way he does Ryder but I am thinking Eva is going to fix that real quick. Or I surely hope so. I can't tell she is getting to him, opening him up a bit.Shew so much has went on in this book. We get more of Ryder and Jade, thank goodness but we also get Harrison and Eva.Ryder refuses to give up jade, no matter what it costs him, jade refuses to let her brother come between her and Ryder. They go some pretty emotional stuff but they come out stronger. And Ryder's plan for the mc...love it!! Brilliant but I'm afraid something is going to happen before they get there. So needless to say I am freaking out and I have to wait like forever to get more. I think I'm gonna have a fit or cry.Right when I feel like they are going to get their HEA it over..done..I can't take the what ifs that ramble in my head. I just need closure. That's all. I need them to come out on top and happy and with little Ryder's and jades running around.I'm even curious what will happen with Harrison and Eva.

I expected some real thought provoking insights I found NONE of this.  It wasn't even remotely emotional....or it wasn't during the first half of the book that I finally managed to get through.  Just a bucket list of stuff to do...with resources that most people would not have.  Sorry...I wanted to like it but cannot waste any more of my time trying to read it.  I even started skimming through it but gave that up also.  How it got 4-5 star reviews I will never understand.

$REVIEW.: Midnight Squad is back and it is still sexy and full of action.  As the continued response and possible conclusion to twilight and how the book ended it felt like a major finger to twilight this book had everything.  Zombies, vampires, demons, werewolf, and oddly enough fairies.  That being said I like the story and how the characters did not change much in terms of personality.  I am also glad that Grim's powers are introduced and to great reaction on how he used them.  The POV change was nice as well where the first book was solely on Grim's POV but since he changed into supernatural mode the POV change to DD was nice.  For DD though, it was hard for me to picture her in he current state as I could not forget how she looked overweight and such form the first book but from what it is said she lost weight and changed a bit.  I am also sad how the relationships in the story changed to the extreme as well as how there had to be a serious Judas moment like the first book.  The final issue that really bothered me was how they went deeper into Penny's family life and how her father was a serious a-hole but when they finally introduce him it was more of a &#34;my god you aren't dead yet&#34; hang up the phone and there is no more of the father.  I would have felt like a funny epilogue if Penny's father is sitting grumbling, but then Grim and Penny show up and go &#34;hello daddy&#34; as Grim reaps him.....but that shall be just an unfulfilled wish.

$REVIEW.: Tear in Time is a fantastic fantasy novel about time travel


Dr

David Warner is a brilliant young surgeon who goes back in time through a portal


He ends up right in the middle of the Civil War, where he teams up with Dr


Jeb Morgan, a Civil War doctor


David teaches Dr


Morgan about modern medicine, while Dr


Morgan teaches David about real survival, prior to the age of needing a cell phone to "survive." Author Christopher Petersen takes several jabs at the shallowness or modern society and our dependence on our conveniences in this novel


He also presents a plausible alternate history had events gone a certain way, given a small disruption in the past
I was very impressed by the attention to detail that Petersen paid to historical figures, making them come alive, and to medical terminology (I understand amputation much better now!).

I think 5 stars is not enough for this book
I think 10 will do it justice.This book is heart-wrenching, beautiful, happy and sad all rolled into one


And I loved Every
Single

Page


I really connected with every character in this book

I especially loved Fern and Bailey


The relationship they had was truly amazing,Fern is the awkward girl, red hair, freckles, petite


Bailey is the boy who has a disease and is stuck in a wheel chair


They are family, but their bond goes beyond that, they are best friends


Bailey isn't the type to feel sorry for himself, and he truly is an inspiration to everyone


Fern has &#34;ugly girl syndrome&#34; as Bailey calls it


She has always been invisible, the only people to really see her are Bailey and her best friend Rita who happens to be gorgeous
Really all that Fern wants is 1 person to see her, and that is the one the whole town loves, Ambrose Young.Fern: &#34;Do you think there's any way someone like Ambrose could fall in love with someone like me?&#34;Bailey &#34;Only if he's lucky.&#34;Rita comes to Fern with a love note she was giving to Ambrose

After he got the letter he responded with poetry, and Rita asked Fern to help her since she was clueless what to write

So Fern took over writing the letters for Rita

Once Ambrose found out he was irritated and hurt


Fern did what she feared the most, and told him she meant every word in those letters and she loved his letter, but then only felt like a fool.&#34;It's hard to come to terms with the fact that you aren't ever going to be loved the way you want to be loved.&#34;Ambrose is tired of being the person that everybody looks up too, he's tired of trying to make everybody else happy


After the 9/11 attack he enlists in the guard, along with his 4 best friends


War takes it's toll on Ambrose and he comes back wounded dramatically

Fern, being the person she is, tries to make things better for Ambrose and her, Bailey and Ambrose form a tight bond.This is where the book got super tough for me
At 77% i FELT something bad was gonna happen, and boy did it ever
I sat there reading with tears steadily running down my face

And they didn't stop until I was finished


Amy Harmon writes with such emotion, and conviction, that I couldn't get enough of the story
I sat up until 4 a.m

reading, until my eyes wouldn't stay open


Then I was back up at 7 a.m

to finish the story.I will read anything this woman writes, and I see she has some already out that I'm going to be reading next!Easily my favorite read this year.

$REVIEW.: Once again, Webb and Weaver have shown their skill and prowess at developing a suspenseful and thrilling novel. This mother/daughter duo have managed to captivate their readers by thickening the plot when necessary with many twists and turns in order to keep them on their toes. I was riveted to the page as I read Collecting Innocents and you will be too. It drew me back over and over again as I was eager to discover the threads from the past and how they would link up to the present crime. Webb and Weaver have skillfully woven a web of  suspense, fear and mystery. Collecting Innocents is a must read!This second suspense novel in the 911 abductions series is a real thriller. It is a follow-up to Cruelty to Innocents where the stage was set with a series of mysterious disappearances of young children. These previous abductions always took place at the scene of an emergency situation in Aberdeen, Maryland when their caregivers were preoccupied with helping others.  Due to this crisis, an emergency agency was formed by Sloanne Kelly and her fiance Shawn Tyler called Saving Angels Agency after the abduction and murder of Sloanne's best friend's daughter.Collecting Innocents is a continuation of this same plot. This time; however, not only children but also their parents and automobiles, are strangely disappearing after emergency calls from 911 Call Boxes on a stretch of highway  between Florida and California on Interstate 10.  These highway crimes take place in the short distance between Slidell Louisiana and Vidor Texas.The novel starts off with the mysterious disappearance of Tammy Pruett and her young daughter, Moira. There have also been two other similar abductions but no one seems to see the connection in these crimes with the exception of Lieutenant Jake Mackenzie, better known as Mac to his friends. Mac is a former employee of the Maryland, Aberdeen Police Department and well aware of the abductions that took place there just over two years ago. He has the uneasy feeling that some how or other these new crimes are connected to the past and what took place. They are hauntingly familiar and he cannot put his uneasiness to rest.  Unable to convince the Sheriff and other police departments  of his suspicions, he reaches out for aid from Shawn and Sloanne and their capable staff at Saving Angels Agency. The gruesome details of the cases unfold in such away that fear is instilled in everyone involved. Shawn and Sloanne once again have the opportunity to put their experienced investigative team to work. Along with the capable help of Birney Sullivan, the former news reporter from Maryland, Aberdeen, these three experts work together to help solve the case.

$REVIEW.: Oh, how I love Amor Towles. Granted, I&#8217;ve only read two things by him, but I&#8217;ve loved both of them. Last summer I raved about Rules of Civility and it made my Top 13 Books of 2013 list without a fight, so when he released this novella as a follow-up on my birthday, I was thrilled. Even though it took me a few months to get around to reading it, I devoured it in one sitting and can say that his incredible writing was not a one-time thing.Although Eve in Hollywood picks up where Rules of Civility leaves off, it is a distinctly independent novella that follows Eve in, well, Hollywood. Each chapter is told by a different person she encounters along the way, all of whom she has a resounding effect on. From shy starlets to movie producers to chauffeurs, Eve touches each of their lives with a nonchalant charm that few can pull off.One problem I frequently have with follow-ups like this is that the characters somehow end up becoming unrecognizable versions of their former selves. Fans of Rules of Civility, however, will be pleased by the author&#8217;s ability to maintain the integrity and essence of Eve&#8217;s original character. I&#8217;m loathe to compare this short read to Towles&#8216; full-length novel, but I would be remiss in ignoring the stylistic differences between the two. Where as Rules of Civility is a book to languish in, Eve in Hollywood is a faster-paced read. Although they offer entirely different reading experiences, Towles&#8216; sincere way with words shines through in both.* Side note &#8211; In this book there was mention of David O. Selznick, a Hollywood producer who was also named in Breakfast at Tiffany&#8217;s by Truman Capote. I found in interesting that real names of producers were used because, of course, anyone whose real name is used nowadays would probably sue.

$REVIEW.: This book is a breezy read about a group of friends who seem to need a bit 'more' than they're getting at home. When you realize it's nonfiction however, the tone takes on a bit more seriousness. Part of me was intrigued as I don't even have time to turn around let alone get massages and start affairs. Witty and fun, this book is a romp into places most of us will never go...but maybe think about when the lights are out. I do have to admit that part of me struggled to identify with anyone in the book and that stopped it from being a 5 star.

$review_text.: Second Time Around by JoAnn Durgin is a beautiful romantic story about a newlywed couple who is forced to learn to love each other again. When Natalie falls down the stairs in their home and then suffers amnesia, she no longer remembers her new husband Marc. Pair her amnesia with his sketchy past (that he never told her about), and Marc has a challenge before him. But he is determined to make his new wife fall in love with him anew. One thing I really liked about the story was its focus on God working out everything (even the really bad things) in our lives for good. Good message in a good story.

$REVIEW.: Although this is a beautiful book, it's not for the baker who wants to bake with whole grains and purely sourdough starters.  Nearly every recipe includes commercial yeast, something I'm trying to avoid.  It is possible to convert these by using a bit more sourdough starter and no commercial yeast, and I've done this with the pizza dough.  It would just be nice that for the price of this book, it to include more commercial yeast-free recipes that don't require me to think as much.

$review_text.: I consider myself a decent cook when it comes to Italian food, but I still learned quite a bit from this book.  It introduces basic tips such as where to store your ingredients, (I had always mistakenly put my tomatoes in the fridge,) and offers a wide variety of tasty recipes.I lived in Italy for a summer, and both my fiance and I are of Italian descent. So I can definitely say that the recipes in the book won't turn out as amazing as say, the lasagna my mother-in-law slaves over in the kitchen for two days.  However, if you're looking for recipes that are authentic enough and require a much more reasonable amount of time and effort, go for it! You'll definitely end up with some tasty meals!

 That being said, I like these short stories, about Harry Bosch


 I read them while sitting with a family member, who was in the  hospital


 With all of the distractions, and interruptions there, these stories were really the right length to read between staff visits.If you are a Harry Bosch fan, and like short stories, you should enjoy these
 I actually found that there has been some reference to one of them, in a subsequent Harry Bosch novel, so it is nice that things do tie in, even though these can stand alone.

$REVIEW.: Jennifer Rosner was caught by surprise when her first daughter was born deaf. How would she establish a relationship with her child? How would her daughter learn about and enjoy the world around her, and how would the world treat her? Rosner soon discovered that deafness had deep roots in her family tree. She began to dig into her ancestry and learn more about how hearing loss tied together generations of women. When her second child was born deaf as well, she continued her journey through the world of modern deafness. This memoir is the story of a mother's journey to help her daughters hear, and also learn to hear and understand her children.Her prologue sums up her story well:For a long time, I thought this story began with my daughter's birth, or just a few hours later, when we learned that she might not hear. But the questions of not hearing began long before her, before me. A string, fragile and thin, a cilia strand, a helix, twists its way back in time to Brooklyn, New York, and before that, to tiny shtetls, specks on the maps of Eastern Europe. For generations, the line has been frayed and tattered.I chose this book because I love family history and the intricate ways generations of lives intertwine. I was a bit disappointed that Rosner's stories about ancestors were not based on fact, but rather her imagination. They were beautiful, meaningful, and creative, but they were still fiction. I think this book would have been more powerful if she'd been able to uncover her ancestor's true stories and had included those in her book.If a Tree Falls is an enjoyable read and brought me deep into the world of modern deafness. I learned a lot, and thoroughly enjoyed Rosner's potent writing style. I admire Rosner for the strength it takes to raise her deaf daughters in a hearing world, and enjoyed every moment of their story. If a Tree Falls should make a great many people more aware of the deaf world. While I wish Rosner could have tied in a bit more fact-based stories about her deaf ancestors, this is still a fantastic book and an enjoyable read.by Jennifer Melvillefor Story Circle Book Reviewsreviewing books by, for, and about women

They made good reading when I was commuting - a new or old Helm paperback in my briefcase helped pass the time on my over one hour commute. I read and re-read the paperbacks until they fell apart.

$REVIEW.: I found this book completely refreshing!  I loved it!  I REALLY wish other readers would stop comparing books - In my mind, this is a totally new genre.  So I guess I understand the comparisons.  But that would be like comparing one historical Scottish romance to another (just an example).  Yes, Fifty Shades, Crossfire Series, Gabriel's Inferno, Blackstone Affair... on and on. They are all wonderful in their own right.  And I love them all!  What I enjoyed about this book is the refreshing characters.  The story has well developed characters and the ending leaves you wanting soooo much more! Jack & Laurelyn both seem so real to me and just jump off the pages with their sincerity.  I loved Laurelyn's character; strong, beautiful, smart, talented, but down to earth and real.  I could really imagine meeting someone like her.  And the love scenes are HOT!  The sex wasn't so drawn out that it took over the book.  There is an actual story line here... and I'm in love with it.

$review_text.: Robertson has written a pretty good story here


I'm not a big fan of book series like this

With some, it feels like you are trapped into buying more books in order to see what happens


Here, while each book does extend the overall story and starts to tie together  (kind of like one of those ensemble stories that all tie in at the end), each book could be read as a separate novel and not demand you read more to find out what happens.I was set back when I started the second book since it seemed to ignore the first and re-tell the story of the epidemic/invasion


It wasn't until later that it was clear it was a parallel story
I kind of liked how he started to tie them together
I continued to be surprised at how the 3rd book tied together one and two.My problems with the stories are two-fold


First, not everyone answers every question with a sarcastic answer


There was way too much of it

You are facing someone who wants to kill you and you use sarcasm? The other issue (and it may get resolved later) is the reasons for the epidemic/invasion haven't been adequately answered
Vague environmentalist reasons really didn't make a lot of sense to me


Also, what their purpose is afterwords is really vague


Walt's situation at the end of volume 3 and the resolution just didn't make sense to me.Overall, though, the writing is excellent and the character development is way better than most similar works
I liked the fact that even in the 3rd novel, he was able to surprise me

A very good read.

$review_text.: Sexy Little Bites: Short Stories to Excite is a collection of 5 very short, naughty stories, each one with a little different flavor.1. Hands-On Training - It's Violet's first day on the job and she finds out her boss's idea of what an assistant duties are is very different from hers:Violet bristled at the blatant examination. "I thought I was here to simply attend to your paperwork or other professional needs," she retorted."Well, I have a wide category of what I consider professional needs. I need to be satisfied in all areas of my life in order to be at my best in the business world," he answered with a predatory smile, as he stood up and headed towards her chair.2. Bound By Love - Abby wakes up to find herself in an unfamiliar room, naked, bound, and alone - alone until the last person in the world she'd thought to see again walks in:As Abby was still trying to make sense of this unexpected bondage situation, someone opened the door and walked in. Abby looked up and into the eyes of someone she would never forget, although she had tried for years. She blinked furiously thinking that this had to be a dream. Surely, he wasn't really here."Hello Abby. I've missed you..."3. Bunk Bed Fun - Setting up a bunk bed for their kids who are off visiting grandma and grandpa makes for some fun times, because when the kids are away, the parents will play:It started to put thoughts into our heads. I curled up close to him and whispered "Do you feel a little naughty too?""I feel like an odd combination of adult criminal and mischievous little boy," my husband answered as he wrapped me in his arms.4. Ebony's Desire - An erotic encounter with a complete stranger gives Ebony a taste for things she'd never known she craved:Her first instinct was to scream, which may have been why another hand abruptly covered her mouth, choking off the sound. Next, she felt herself being pushed out of the chair. With her back still to the intruder, she shivered in fear, as well as some strange sort of excitement. Whoever was behind her, kicked the old chair out of the way and hauled her body against him, pulling her behind the concealing rack of clothing.5. Final Fantasy - A woman in love, but less than thrilled with their sex life decides it's time to stop just thinking about fixing it, and actually do something about it!:She had been planning this for a while, but was still quite nervous. They had always shared an extremely vanilla love life, no spice at all really. In fact, they usually did the exact same things in the exact same order and ended it in missionary style sex. She knew that she wanted more variety, some excitement and naughtiness. It was time to stop hiding her true desires, but she still feared rejection or being misunderstood.The bottom line - If you're looking for some quick, down-and-dirty stories to heat things up, be sure and check these out!This book was provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.

$review_text.: Elizabeth Warren is, with the help of her daughter, a really good writer.  This book intertwines her personal and political autobiographies in an entertaining (sometimes even funny, sometimes almost excruciating) narrative.  It introduces the many people who have been (and many who continue to be) part of her life, and it gives insight into how she felt about the many experiences that have led her to the intersection that she is today--a U.S. Senator, a mother, a grandmother, a wife, a friend, a teacher.  She even conveys the results of much of her scholarly research in a thoroughly readable manner.  I read the book on my iPad, so I didn't discover the massive documentation (endnotes) until I had finished the book.  I am glad, because I am a retired academic and would have felt compulsively drawn to the notes had their numbering been included in the text.  The book is thoroughly documented at the end, in the notes and the bibliographic material.  Much more fun are the numerous photos that show her through the various stages of her life, which are also at the end.  I loved reading the book and recommend it highly.

$review_text.: don't miss Mr. Butler's books. I collect every book I can find on the subject, and this author not only is very readable and interesting (I'm plowing through this one as fast as the Carpathia rushing to pick up survivors) but he always manages to add new facts and ideas that weren't in other books. I find it really intruiging that he considers Captain Stanley Lord of the Californian, who didn't bother to come to the aid of the sinking Titanic, to be a sociopath. I haven't seen this theory anywhere else, but it is certainly plausible and would go a long way to explain Lord's behavior in the situation. In fact, Mr. Butler reveals more about Lord's character than I have previously read. In 1912 it's likely that the concept of sociopathy was not fully known. Lord is compared with Captain Rostron of the Carpathia, who was the hero of the hour, and whose career really took off after the Titanic rescue. I also would like to recommend Mr. Butler's earlier book, Unsinkable. I hope he will write more about the Titanic, maybe about Captain Edward Smith or Bruce Ismay. My only complaint, which is not the author's fault, is that this book went to press full of typos and printing errors. This is the second new book I've read in a few weeks that is this sloppy. What is the matter with the publishers today? I'm an editor, I notice these things.

$REVIEW.: How often do you the reader get presented with the phrase "brilliant..could not put it down" "had to finish" Dead Broken is one of those books when you pick up, start reading, you will want to continue and not stop until the unpredictable and surprising conclusion. Peter Murphy has suffered a great trauma, he was attacked and badly injured both mentally and physically so he has had to take some time out, rest from work and stay at home with his wife Karen and two children...but he doesn't help out at home instead spending his time playing computer games or buying unwanted items on ebay. One such purchase is a book and with this book comes an introduction to Steven man of evil and the brother of a priest accused of murder. This is much more than a straight forward crime story, it explores the deteriorating relationship of two people Karen & Peter living on the edge, and with the greatest of ease progresses into horror most foul and a scene reminiscent of the horror movie Saw....The style of writing is easy on the eye, the story never lets up, the elements of horror and crime are finely balanced to produce a top notch and highly enjoyable first book by Mr Gray. As we progress into the horror theme there are some great and memorable opinions and conversations...."When you're young the world is your oyster, you're a loose cannon free to roam wherever you choose. You can go around the world, join a band, hang around on a street corner drinking with your mates, anything, you have no ties. Then you get older, find a wife, buy a house, have kids and settle down. All you want to do at the end of the day is come home, close your door and relax with a glass of wine in the firm knowledge that both you and your loved ones are snug, cosy and warm. You're no longer a loose canon; your goals in life have changed. In short, you want stability, but what threatens stability? I'll tell you what. Loose cannons threaten stability. Anything that threatens your family and home threatens stability. The youth haven't changed over the years Peter, you have. You're middle aged, just like the rest of society. The youth are no more a threat to you now than they,ve ever been" I also thought that the interaction between Murphy and his dead father a beautiful addition...here we have a man unable to communicate with his wife but can strike up a conversation with his deceased dad, who was committed to an asylum, and the reader is further left to ponder sometimes on what is reality, what is a dream and could Peter Murphy himself be responsible for the recent murders....a delicious mix and intrigue! I actually downloaded this ebook as a freebie to my kindle and was truly amazed by the ease and quality of the writing all elements in the story coming together creating a memorable and highly enjoyable read....I look forward to future books by this author.

It goes over some simple Daoist ways such as :  enjoying what we are doing, not becoming a slave to things by living a cluttered life.  So the ceremony of preparing and drinking tea becomes a time to savor life.  This read is quite interesting with chapters on the History of Tea in China,  Tea Mind, Zen Mind,  A Daoist Tea Ceremony, Health Benefits of Tea, Types of Tea, and sources for tea.  As an added flavor to this book; sayings from the Dao de Jing are sprinkled throughout.  It is a lovely book and quite reader friendly; I would definitely recommend  this to anyone who wants to relax with a good book.

We follow Rik a halfbreed member of a Forager Company. He's a somewhat unlikely hero. Blah blah. He and the Foragers battle against mysterious foes trying to bring back a dead god. Blah. If you want something easy, mind numbing, and over-dramatizated then this is for you.

$REVIEW.: As a recent convert to Orthodox Christianity from Protestantism, I'm always looking for things pertaining to the Orthodox Church as it is in America, and without the overtones of being &quot;Russian Orthodox, Greek Orthodox, etc.&quot;  This book does that.The first part of the book is that of the author's personal journey to Orthodoxy

 After decades of trying to find the &quot;True Way&quot; among various Protestant denominations, he still felt that something was *missing* in the Protestant view of the Church and of the world
 He also goes on to elaborate just what it was that seemed to be missing or contradictory in Protestant doctrine, both specifically, and in general.The second part of the book is almost a handbook as to what the Orthodox church may look like to those coming from a Protestant viewpoint
 Things such as veneration of icons, formal prayers, and church tradition are discussed here in a way for those who probably have had very little experience with these things.I, myself, am tickled to read about others' journeys to (and within) Orthodoxy, particularly in America

 I just sent this book in a package to my mom

 I don't know if she will read it, but if she does, I hope that she will at least come away knowing that me becoming Orthodox has everything to do with the church, and very little to do with me being fascinated with Russia or whatnot.

$review_text.: This book was a serious disappointment to me, largely because it did not do what it promised to do.  This was not a guide to help me navigate through the various English translations of the Bible to figure out which one(s) might help me the most.  Instead, it was Ryken's blistering critique against the functional equivalence approach to translation, in which he essentially assigns most English translations of the past half-century as utterly devoid of spiritual and literary value.Most frustrating about the book is that the author has a lot of helpful information to share about the process of translation and the philosophical difference between the essentially literal approach (word-for-word) and the functional equivalence approach (or dynamic equivalence, thought-for-thought).  It is important for Christians to understand the difference in the translations that fall within these two camps, and a book to describe and catalog these differences would have been wonderful.Rather than offering this helpful possibility, Ryken takes his preference for essentially literal translations to ridiculous and logically absurd conclusions.  As just one example, he says that much of Jesus teaching was not meant to make sense to the original listeners and readers, and so thought-for-thought translation inappropriately tries to eliminate that intended confusion.  But he completely ignores the fact that essentially literal translation can easily insert confusion and nonclarity where it never existed for the original readers, thereby providing a case when functional equivalence is actually more faithful to the text by returning the clarity of the original biblical language.Ryken's primary gripe against functional equivalence is that it incorporates interpretation within the translation process.  However, the nature of translation is inherently interpretative, as no two languages have a set of parallel words with identical definitions.  There are certainly potential concerns when the interpretation within the functional equivalence method yields markedly different renderings from one translation to another, a point that Ryken rightly makes, but this does not eradicate the value of the process.  Ryken makes the critical and unfortunate mistake of throwing out the baby with the bathwater.Ryken has such a strong predisposition against the NIV, NLT, The Message and many others that it's a wonder that those who read these translations are even Christians.  I found his entire approach to be arrogant and his attempts to defend his extreme position to be unconvincing.  He has some good cautions to provide those of us who read functional equivalence translations.  However, I still see great value in good ones like the New Living Translation (my favorite for personal devotions).  I wish that this book had been written to describe the differences between the various translations, rather than as an excuse to lambaste those who do not share Ryken's unbending commitment to wooden, word-for-word translations as the only legitimate English translations of the Bible.

 The bad aliens show up so those three leave the planet with family and some friends to plan the fight to take back the earth
 Meanwhile the &#34;Ultra-Liberal&#34; president of the US hands the planet over to the bad aliens because he is a complete moron and nobody has the power to stop him from destroying the constitution.I like the concept

 Anyone who has read a Marvel comic book secretly wishes they could become super soldiers
 Unfortunately, the plot has more holes than old cheesecloth, the characters are uninspiring or ignorant of basic facts in their field of expertise (or so useless they are present and on scene for the entire book for no discernible reason(Paul)), and there is more hand wavium present than should EVER happen in a single book.Why is he a Lieutenant Colonel?  There are no other officers on the trip and he was already a Captain
 Now, poof, an LTC


 Because...yeah.Why didn't they start by experimenting with one person?  Starting with 12 when they already KNEW it would create a serious reaction (fever, unconsciousness, vomiting) strains the limits of medical care
 Bad science.Why Paul?  What the hell is a geologist doing in this mess anyway?  The military already KNEW it wasn't a meteorite; never mind the question of what use a geologist would be when retrieving a meteorite in the first place.I went with 2 stars because while the plot and characters were horrible, there didn't seem to be too many egregious writing mistakes


 Scenes were consistent, words were spelled right, tenses remained constant, etc
 Even the hand wavium remained consistent...mostly.

$REVIEW.: Radiation explains so many superhero powers, it's refreshing to see a more unique method of creating them. And to find a superhero book that classifies as science fiction instead of fantasy is even more rare. If that interest you, you're likely to find this book a refreshing read.It is an origin story, no doubt. But Mr. Rice does a good job of keeping it interesting. A mysterious girl named Genie starts talking to Clarice in a chat room. She ends up bringing in her brother Allan and his friends into the discussion. Next thing you know, this mysterious girl is shipping them suits that enable them to do as much and more than what their favorite comic book superheroes can do.But the real questions are who is she, how can she do this, and why is she doing it? The answer to those questions leads them to discover whether being a superhero involves more than super powers.This book is a fun read for people of all ages even though it is directed toward young adults. It is well written, and the characters are fun. The plot keeps you wondering what will happen next. On the book as a whole, I'd have to say I enjoyed it and would recommend it hardily to anyone seeking a book to give to a child, teen, or even an older "child" who enjoys superhero stories.If I were to fault the book for anything, it would be sometimes the story gets too bogged down in the technical details of how everything works. For the geek, this is interesting. And I don't mind some of that myself, but I found at certain points wishing we could skip the explanations and get on with the story. And to that end, it seemed the distribution of the suits dribbled out. In some ways, that would be truer to life, yes. But it slowed the story down. Despite that, Mr. Rice kept the pace overall on a good foot. So while I had those problems, it didn't mar the story significantly.It should also be mentioned that this book has Christian characters written by a Christian. Mr. Rice does a good job of not doing a lot of preaching through this story, though you will find some messages coming through here and there. However, those are natural to the characters and the story. Most people whether religious or not, will enjoy it for what it is: teens from various backgrounds dealing with the moral dilemmas of gaining such powers and how to use them.I enjoyed reading this story. It makes a great stocking stuffer for the reader in your family. And who knows, you might find yourself picking it up and getting sucked into it. I look forward to more stories about these kids in the future from this author.

It's surprising to me that other than ordering pizza or cooking spaghetti, people have no idea how to cook Italian meals and rely on getting their favorites only when they go to their favorite Italian restaurant.  This book takes the mystery out of cooking Italian classics such as Chicken Marsala, Linguine with Clams, etc. while giving great tips along the way.  It covers every category from appetizers, soups, pizzas, salads, and desserts.  Even experienced cooks will learn something by reading this book.  I'm especially looking forward to using the recipe for tiramisu parfaits and making my own risotto.  I'll be using this book to plan for more wonderful dinner parties, too!  This would be a wonderful gift for anyone who loves Italian food....everyone!

I loved the &#34;murder now, murder then&#34; element and was genuinely creeped out as Lange started uncovering details of the murders that had been committed in her home - an old farmhouse that Jennifer did a fantastic job making super spooky. The book is haunting in the ways that the best ghost stories are: you'll want to read with the lights ON...and you'll be left with that tingly, goosebumps feeling on the back of your neck for long after you read the last page.Seriously, when I say spooky, I mean SPOOKY. It's absolutely perfect for an October read...it's got a fabulous Halloween vibe and fits well with chill autumn breezes and horror movie season.

One thing I noticed about Erin's account was her lack of compassion and self absorption. For example, she writes about one of their slaves who walked 50 miles each way to go to the dentist. She would pass him with her car, yet not give him a ride because she was going the other way. It seems strange that she would not have made the effort to coordinate a ride with him. In many ways, I feel that Erin is covering up some unsavory aspects of her involvement Ditto Sean (her brother).  How is it that people still believe in this nonsense, after all of this time?

$review_text.: I received a reviewers copy of The River of no Return, but never got around to it in the wobbling stacks of books of 2013 i keep tripping over.  So I hesitated in taking this ancillary work on.Still I found that it worked overall.  At least in terms of being readable and not overly reliant on the work it is associated.  As a short little self contained story it pretty much works.  I do suspect that there was plenty that a reader of last year's novel could appreciate.  But I was pleased that it didn't get in my way reading.I did find the story itself and the characterizations in particular, to be a bit cloying.  But I get and appreciate that this was the type of story the author is telling.  And that for such an audience, which is wide, this is a huge plus.  Still, despite this aspect of the story being not exactly to my taste, I still came away with the desire to pull the novel out and see for myself, how this author executes a fuller work.

$review_text.: It amazes me when an author is able to engage a reader and create believable, three dimensional characters in such a short space of time. I love how Ms. Jones wove humor into her story--I laughed a couple times, especially near the beginning when Dominic realizes Alyssa can see him. I never would've expected a romance between a ghost and a human to work...or turn out happy in any way, but I was pleasantly surprised. A nice quick read, with some heat thrown in to really spice things up. Recommended!

When I thought about it I have no one in the military, but that's wrong because they're out there for all of us!  I Thank them each and everyone for all they do.  This story has it all.

$review_text.: Power For Life has such a balance of power, faith and holiness.  My favorite chapters are about Grace and Identity. The revelation is truly life changing. Grace is available power from God to keep you from messing up. You can learn how to be supercharged to do great things for God. This book is truly positive and will have you thinking that way.Every chapter is packed with encouragement and Matt's amazing testimony. If you are pressing in for more of God in your life, read this over and over. I love going through the Kindle highlights and adding more each time I read.  Hopefully there will be another book in the works! The television show, Cd's and pod-casts are also amazing.

$review_text.: Over the years, we've all heard people describe themselves by their zodiac sign, A or B personalities, the 4 seasons and various other defining traits. Well, color is the latest and from what I can see after taking the test in this book, the author has nailed it. It's almost spooky to see how the color we are identified with, also called our color sign, really does relate to our personality traits.I have been a graphic artist for many years and color is very important in my life. But I never looked at it this way! No, it's not a matter of choosing your favorite color - read the book and find out. This has to do more with how compatible you are with love and friendship - not how you react to color but how color defines who you are - and not just whether you are a "type A Gemini who is a Spring." I highly recommend this great little book - the author really knows what she's talking about!

$review_text.: This is a prequel to O'Grady's bestselling debut novel - Hybrid. As the name suggests, this book tell us the story of Amanda and how she came to become the person that she is in Hybrid.The novel starts off with Amanda just losing her husband and two year old son to an accident. As she tries to start fresh she gets an opportunity to go to Honduras as a part of Red Cross's cyclone rescue team. Once there, the team comes to realize that not all is as it seems. The town is almost deserted and those who survived and remained there, seemed to be affected by some sort of virus. Their own camp is infected and within a few weeks the team of over thirty people perished because of the virus, only Amanda survives. When a rescue team arrives and safely pulls her out of the situation, one would think that she was finally safe. But no, she is put into isolation and for months numerous tests are done on her. She had survived a deadly virus, but can she survive and emerge from the clutches of a few mere humans?Well, I am not about to tell you the whole story. You'll have to read the story to find out what happens then.There are quite a few wonderful characters that I just loved in this book starting with Amanda's in-laws - Greg & Lisa. They are the most delightful as a couple, as parents and as people. Then there are people like Bernice, Bennet and Lister are difficult to find these days. And what can I say about Amanda. Her character has many shades and we see different sides of her as she grows throughout the book. At times I felt really bad for her and at times I felt scared of her. The author has simply created a brilliant character through her who is both good and bad. You will cheer for her, feel her sadness and feel the darkness in you too.The plot felt a little too simple at the beginning. But things got interesting once Amanda was released to her family from her isolation. Watching her trying to discover and understand the person she had become, trying to settle back into some form of life and trying to stay in control was really an experience. The pace of the story is just right - not too slow nor is it fast. At times it may seem to be dragging, but the information provided during that period is actually important and I realized it even while I was reading it.Frankly speaking, under normal circumstances I wouldn't really have picked this book up. It has a very plain cover with not so intriguing title. Plus I could hardly find a proper summary for it. But I have toured with PICT quite a few times and each time I have rated those books as 5Stars. So I knew that this book had to have some quality and picked it up. I am glad that I did. This was a refreshing change for me. I enjoyed both the drama part of it and the scientific part of it.

$review_text.: Written in Malice is Oliver's POV of Laced in Malice. I was extremely excited to read his POV. Even though it was retelling LIM, WIM felt like a completely different story. LIM left me confused about Oliver. I wasn't sure how I felt, I didn't know if I could trust him, I wasn't sure how he really felt about Zara. Again, I was confused. WIM cleared that all up for me. Getting inside Oliver's head was interesting. I knew things about him, but I got to see Oliver in a whole new light. I now understand why he is like he is and how hard it was for him to deal with his feelings for Zara and why he does things for Lizzie; whom I still HATE. I actually think I hate her even more now.WIM just opened my eyes to how Oliver really feels about everything and I loved it. Like I now love Oliver. Riley Gray has written a wonderful male POV to go along with LIM, that just captures your attention and makes you want to keep reading. Now I want the next book! I need to know what's going to happen! And Oliver better make things work with Zara, I'm counting on him!

$review_text.: Mitchell Evans always wanted to leave his home in Texas behind and become a famous ballet dancer.  He's achieved his goal, but a bad breakup and losing a coveted role sends Mitch back home to deal with his father's estate that he's been ignoring for six months.  Driving into his home town, Mitch swerves to avoid a reindeer in the road. He's rescued by the man who crushed Mitch's heart twelve years ago.  Texas Ranger Web Eisley is as handsome as ever, and the attraction between them still burns bright and hot.  But it'll take a Christmas miracle for Mitch and Web to get a second chance at a relationship.LONE STAR features many of the romance tropes I enjoy and, as always, I can count on author Josh Lanyon to give the tried and true plot points of reunion romances his own spin.  Mitch and Web are both likeable heroes who are clearly meant to be with one another.  That being said, it surprised me that LONE STAR lacked the charm that Mr. Lanyon can usually be counted on to infuse his stories with.  LONE STAR is by no means a bad story, but it wasn't quite what I've come to expect from Mr. Lanyon.  There was also an added element concerning a reindeer only Mitch saw.  I'm not sure if it was a paranormal element, a hallucination or simply a tie-in to a Christmas gift from Web later in the story.  Still, LONE STAR is a satisfying read overall.LilyReviewed for Romance Junkies

Of course their lives can't be as simple as that, as Sam receives as call that the President's Deputy Chief of Staff's wife has been murdered and their young daughter kidnapped. Nick is friends with the Deputy and is as engaged in this as ever. We are reintroduced to all the people in Sam and Nick's life, along with a surprising Agent Avery Hill, who cant shake is crush on Sam. The plot twist from there and I am sure other reviews will explain further.What I really liked about this book was the pacing, the surprises, the development we continue to see with all the characters. They are flawed and human. Excited #6 is coming soon!

$REVIEW.: On the day Candace Andrews turns another year older, she makes a decision that will begin the process of changing her life - sort of. An innocent, virginal, family-sheltered young woman, Candace is the type of character readers will both love and hate. In a fit of rebellion from her overbearing parents and overprotective brother (and an overly annoying best friend), Candace decides to get a tattoo done, but she'll only have it done by Brian Ross - the ex-boyfriend of her closest cousin. Brian is the type of man that people judge based on looks - long(ish) hair, tattoo sleeves, and visible (and some not) piercings. While their families are both from the same breeding ground of high class society, the pair couldn't be more different.But there is more than meets the eye in this erotic romance by Cherrie Lynn. Candace isn't as innocent as most would think, at least, not in her mind and Brian isn't the super-tough, super-scary bad boy, though he once was that boy in his teenage years. Though their families play a large part in the ups and downs of the relationship between the two characters, ROCK ME is ultimately, Candace's coming-of-age story.There are pros and cons to ROCK ME. The romance is there in the midst of hot scenes that isn't just about inserting Tab A into Slot B though that will happen - eventually. Brian is the type of "bad boy" I'm a fan of - inked skin, a no-nonsense attitude, and some very interesting piercings. Lynn writes more than just a piece of erotica though the sex she does write is enough to cause readers to fan themselves. Even Candace, in the beginning, seems like the atypical naive girl who just wants to break free.However, in any journey a person takes, there needs to be reasons for the choices he or she makes and this is where I thought ROCK ME fell flat. Candace flip-flops between her emotions - a normal process for a college girl - but she sometimes does it without a thought process and almost twists it in a way that I wanted to tell her to "Woman up and deal!" While I appreciated her at the start of the novel, her actions and words regarding her family and the relationship she had with Brian was infuriating, especially once the real conflict between the two sides occur.As a whole, I enjoyed ROCK ME. My recommendation of it stems mostly from the male protagonist and the interludes that happen between the sheets... and on a couch... and outdoors... and anywhere else that might work. Despite Candace's waffling, this novel is an easy read with paragraphs that flow into each other and two people who are connected both physically and emotionally.-- originally reviewed for Ordinary People, Extraordinary Works --

Especially since at the time of writing the book she had only been studying ACIM for 5years or so.I'm not a great writer myself so won't be able to put together a clever review.  I can say that Susan's insights bring clarity especially about the "forgiveness " process.  ACIM uses an expanded form of forgiveness; an acceptance of what is that makes life easier and more pleasant.  Susan explains it better and so well in her book.This book is very well written and I would read paragraphs over and over because of their great depth.If you are looking for an aid in understanding ACIM on a more practical level this book will not disappoint.

$review_text.: What if the H7N9 vaccination wasn&#8217;t just a preventative measure against swine flu? It seemed like the flu came out of nowhere and yet, in no time at all the government manufactured a vaccination. Were lab workers diligent, or could the virus itself have been man-made?Mr. Tomasso&#8217;s new book takes a growing fear within society and multiplies it by a thousand. Government conspiracies abound as this epidemic gone mad story focuses on one man&#8217;s survival and ultimately his desperate need to save his children. Chase McKinney works as an emergency dispatcher for the Rochester Police Department and his run of the mill shift takes a dramatic turn for the worse when his phone bank explodes with calls. An infection is sweeping across the entire city and the dead are rising. The situation soon turns from bad to worse when the government&#8217;s untested vaccination response is shown to produce a cannibal affect on the inoculated adding more horror for the survivors.Chase is the focus of the story and Mr. Tomasso did a wonderful job creating the character. Chase&#8217;s sole focus is on his children. In their last communication, the kids are terrified and on the run from his ex-wife&#8217;s home. We&#8217;re brought with Chase as he makes a desperate search for the kids, balancing his every decision on his single focus of reaching them before it&#8217;s too late.I was captivated by the father &#8211; children dynamic and blown away by the wonderfully awful blood and gore...For the entire review visit What Horror Looks Like at [...]

Not the most thrilling romantic suspense book I&#8217;ve ever read, and I admit to having some &#8220;oh, I want to smack Jenna&#8221; moments because she was a bit ditzy, but in the end, things worked out all right.I liked Riley as the FBI consultant and how he was so torn between duty and lust. That happens often in books, but Ms. Davis & Ms. Marr didn&#8217;t let that feel contrived or clich&eacute;d.Jenna &#8211; wahoo! Erotic romance writer has adventures! I like when authors write about authors because (usually) it gives the author characters a better feeling of realism.I&#8217;m giving this book 3.5 stars and hope you guys check it out.

$REVIEW.: NOTE:  I received this package with the book BADLY damaged TWICE.  I am now waiting on Amazon as they check their inventory.  This review is solely based on assuming that they will send you a copy in mint condition, like it should be.If you are totally obsessed with the television series (more so than the books), then this is a dream come true.  Tons of colorful pictures inside a beautiful, plush book with lots of interesting facts about the show, behind-the-scenes, and interviews with actors, cast, and crew members.  There are also convenient family trees that can help you figure out who is who.  The storyboards are also very unique and the maps are gorgeous.Now, if you are a "bookwalker" like me, this is not so informative.  The pictures are beautiful, everything is really high quality and nice, but it's not informative to a diehard book reader at all.  It's very elementary and obviously not canon, so some of the things they tell you or characters they quote don't even happen in the books.  For instance, Jon Snow never said goodbye to Ned Stark before he left to King's Landing in the books, but in the show Ned tells Jon that they'll talk about their mother when he gets home.  That is Jon Snow's featured quote in the book.This is a GREAT collector's item, assuming that they'll send actually send you a pristine copy, unlike me, and an awesome talking piece.  Best for a diehard show fan, but if you're a diehard book fan, you won't learn too much.  The interviews are still really interesting though if you're into that sort of thing, and like I said - great presentation with glossy, high quality pictures.

Ruled by a strict government, residents are not allowed to travel to the dangerous outskirts of the city, where legends say monsters rule the land. And that is just were Doogan and his wife Keeyla try to smuggle their young son, Fabal, after the boy is chosen for a perilous job by the government.Constantine paints a vivid picture of a post-apocalyptic world and those unfortunate souls who reside in it. The fast-paced story is highlighted by the author&#8217;s strong prose and well-developed characters.  Constantine is a talented storyteller with a robust imagination that radiates throughout the story.Readers who want an intelligent, exciting tale will certainly enjoy this Sci-Fi adventure by a promising new voice in fiction.Steven Donahue was a copywriter for TV Guide magazine for 14 years.

You feel their emotion, their passion, their pain, their hopes and their dreams.  Having read the two previous books in this series and been delighted with them I was really looking forward as to how the third book continued. Again I was not disappointed.  It is an amazing story and one which i would highly recommend to read. I laughed and I cried feeling every emotion that was written about.  I am sure Leanne is destined to be a very well known,respected and well loved popular author.  Please read this book you will never regret doing so.

Its pretty action packed towards the end but in a way that really has very little to due with the actual story. I give the story line a 3...but the book is hilarious.

$review_text.: Skai has been misused, abused and hurt like he!!...all at the hands of family


Rejected, neglected, and subjected to the bottom of the barrel and betrayed beyond belief

She wants better for herself but can't seem to crawl out of the sewage that is her life
Izzy is a private investigator hired to provide information of a philandering spouse

This case places the desolate Skai on his radar and Izzy has to chose business or personal

Drawn to her, Izzy introduces himself and infiltrates her sordid life and the rollercoaster ride begins.Skai's The Limit is a fast paced short love story trimmed with hopelessness, helplessness, and darkness


When a glimmer of light breaks the monotony, will Skai be brave enough to run for the pot of gold? For as many layers that Skai revealed, the enigmatic Izzy has as many layers left uncovered which piques the readers curiousity that much more


Tajana's newest characters are intriguing and their storyline is captivating


Due to the length of the read, the development felt rushed
This is a winning read,I would have liked to see more development as far as the relationship, but it was just too short and the editing is distractive


Ms


Sutton has a few under her belt and improvement should be evident, but it was not

The story of Lucky and swoon-worthy Zane continues in this drama and angst filled book. Zane is still out for revenge on his brother's death and slowly integrating himself in with the drug selling crowd. Major secrets are revealed and will shock everyone at the end!! Can Lucky and Zane survive with Zane's one-track mind on revenge or will all of his secrets bring this relationship down?I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone (as long as you have read the Last Boyfriend of course). J.S. Cooper's writing is just fantastic and her work just keeps getting better and better.

$review_text.: I downloaded this book free, from the Kindle Buffet.  LOVE that app!  Thought it would be a good summer read.  It is.  I had to FORCE myself to put it down or I wouldn't have gotten anything else done!The characters are good.  Easy to like and root for them. I can't wait to learn more about them in later books in this series.The story has several different viewpoints.  Kirkland & Maize do a good job of being able to put you in the minds of both adult professional women and high school girls.  Not an easy task, if you ask me.There are several good plot twists.  Just when you think things are going to be "wrapped" up, you notice that there is quite a bit of book left... so you have to wonder "what's next?".Spoiler alert - it doesn't get "all wrapped up with a bow" by the end of this book.  Some things are.  Some things aren't.  I will HAVE to read the next installment.It's a good start.

$review_text.: An unholy communion is very well written and the author has a wonderful knack for setting the stage and building atmosphere so you feel like you are right there during the story. There were many different twists and turns in the story and the descriptions of various passages truly made you feel that spiritual warfare was involved. Unfortunately I didn't really connect with this story as I found the book more of a history lesson with a mystery thrown in. I also had issues with some of the catholic parts of the book. Yes, it's called the monastary murders -but I found it to be very inconsistent since there are married priests in this story (the main character and the character that were murdered are both priests ~ one is married the other is engaged). It was interesting to hear some of the stories of the saints and reading the twists on the Stations of the Cross (not being Catholic I don't know much about the stations but it was interesting how he set up the little devotionals to fit the lives and needs of the teens in his care during the tour he was leading).I was quite disappointed in this book as I thought I would connect with it right away. You might check it out from the library and see what you think about it before you buy it - I hope to pick up one of her other books at the library and hopefully I'll find it as enjoyable as I think Crow's story's can be.I gave it a 3 star due to the level of the writing.Disclaimer: I was given a copy of An Unholy Communion to read and review on GivingNSharing. I was not required to have a positive review and no money exchanged hands. Thanks for reading!

Jaxson is amazing to her and i love that he flips his life for her without question


the second half of the book is a little odd after they break up and i really dislike jaxson's mom for being the reason

she didnt need to give sarah her fears when jaxson was perfectly happy and would die for sarah if he needed to
the second half of the book was still good but again a little strange


jaxson and his biker crew are good but the rest of the bikers are crude


the reason for the four stars was the ending
i really didnt care for the whole plot of the next book and it wasnt very interesting

Overall it is actually pretty good if you are the person that also like &#34;P-H&#34; stories of the believable to unbelievable variety.Some stories are a bit raunchy but most seem to written to get exactly what you might be looking for if you are even looking at something like this!

Lately, they haven't been making love at all

 Is she willing to give up what she has with Jess to get that back?  Should she go out and have an affair to get back at him?  Is  he cheating on her?  What is Jess hiding from Marcy?

 He lets her have at it and after she teases him and screams at him and drives him wild with desire, she walks away leaving him speechless
 How he acts after that drives Marcy even crazier!Even though this novella was only forty pages, it packed a punch!  I was mad at Jess and was like, Geez, if Geeks cheat what does that mean for the rest of us??  I was instantly caught up in Marcy and Jess' marriage and had to find out how they were going to get past this

 I really liked the characters in GEEKUS INTERRUPTUS and love Mickey's style of writing! This is my first read by Mickey Corrigan but it won't be my last! A very strong four stars  for me!  If you are looking for a quick funny read you can't go wrong with GEEKUS INTERRUPTUS.

$REVIEW.: I enjoyed this collection of short stories.  The author attempts to identify what was occurring with Mr. Darcy during the times he was not in Hertfordshire or with the Bennet family.  In addition, a couple of the short stories pertain to the life of the Darcys after their marriage.  I concur with the other reviewers that most of the stories are exceptionally good, with the characters and the plots consistent with canon.  I especially loved the interactions between Darcy and his sister Georgiana.  The stories set in present day I found to be of less interest.  I look forward to reading more from this author.

$review_text.: Entertaining cozy mystery but a bit too "cozy" for me personally. I liked the plot with an old school being renovated and bones from a murder 40 years previously being discovered. The secondary plotline with the main character being stalked by a former boyfriend didn't seem to work as well for me.Interesting characters that were quite well developed but I did have trouble with the group of local female friends that immediately attached themselves to the main character on her arrival in the small town. I had the uncomfortable feeling I was reading about a bunch of high school girls and their 'clique' rather than a group of adult women in their 30s and 40s.I think, for me, the best part of the entire book was the running joke with the main character becoming almost instantly notable with the whole small town gossip mill for her purple panties with pink bows and the embarrassment of the young carpenter who accidentally displayed them from the laundry basket.

$review_text.: Rachel Scott's daughter was abducted at age three. Rachel searched for Mallory for avery long time, and in fac, has never stopped. Not long after Mallory vanished Rachel heard ofanother neighborhood child who had gone missing, his name was Jack. Rachel reached out to hismother Janine and Florida Omni Search was born. It is on the activities of Florida Omni searchthat both of these novels are based.The first, Asylum Harbor, follows a somewhat torn from the headlines issue of young women going missingfrom cruse ships. The most recent, being Amber Knowles. He father is Governor of Florida and is about to announce his candidacy for President of the Untied states. An otherwise worldly and intelligent man, he agree that despite his circumstances, his seventeen year old daughter should be allowed to cruise to the Bahamas with two friends and just two parents as chaperones. Whose parents they were never became clear, as they were not the parents of Amber's two companions. They were also not doing much in the way of chaperoning. It was only after an extensive search of the ship by the two girls and some SeaStar staff that they became aware that Amber was missing.The next story Burn Out, involves a firefighter who has gone missing. Sam's mother gave Rachel the details that she could and the information that Sam was planning to leave her job as a firefighter. Her husband Ken had gotten mixed up in an unsavory situation and although Sam herself had been cleared, things were never the same for her.Both stories involve dark rooms and betrayal. There are several places where information is repetitive andthe stories become tedious. The dialogue does not flow smoothly, nor does it hold your interest for long.Not recommended.

$review_text.: Fourat Janabi's passionate and entertaining look at the 3 pressing S's of this universe: Science, Statistics and Skepticism, is,  as the subtitle to this work testifies, an art of differentiation.In this age of memes and virals on Facebook - which always seem to me to be the blind leading the blind - telling us how bad GMO crops, vaccines and theories of evolution are, Janabi once again pulls up a chair and takes a really hard look at something most people "liking" memes on Facebook don't do - facts from qualified and independent scientists on the subjects that lately have come up as dinner party discussions lately in the modern hemisphere. He even explains why Newton has been proven wrong - and why NASA still uses these wrong equations to send rockets into Space.Since his last book, which I thoroughly recommend also, Janabi has indeed done it again. Drawing the reader in with his " Bad Science" chapter, using great examples of how data can be changed to look like anything (he shows a chart of how consumption of organic food is related to autism rising over the last five years - an untrue and random comparison showing exactly how false correlation can be) according to the purpose of the study, he explains exactly why the herd mentality of going with he who shouts loudest is not the best way of differentiating fact from myth. When he moves into "Good Science" it is absolutely impossible to fault empirical measures and really shows how the trend towards organic foods and being anti-vaccine, and the idea of creationism, are non-substantiated - not by scientists working for the "corporations" (another word bandied around mainly by those who have never worked in one) but by independent and universal laws of science, such as biological reaction, statistics that work (studies are thrown by not setting their conditions properly) and genes as nature's helpers rather than the devil's work. As usual, the quotes used are spot on, such as this on why it is wrong to oppose GMO crop use,"If our society will not be able to "de-demonize" transgenic technology soon, history will hold it responsible for [the] death and suffering of millions: people in the poor world, not in overfed and privileged Europe, the home of the anti - GMO hysteria" Ingo Potrykus (Plant Scientist)The most amusing chapter is about homeopathy. Another unfashionable subject to baulk at, but Janabi's  in the grain explanations are hilariously accurate and quite stunning. Did you know that a bottle of so-called homeopathic remedy has nothing of the substance in it, because it would have to contain more water than is present on Earth in the bottle to contain one atom of substance?Fourat Janabi, I am sure, will soon be noticed as a challenging and talented Humanist speaker on Truth - the trouble is, of course, that it's not fashionable to be in the possession of the scientific truth when it comes to these touchy subjects. But I for one wish him all the luck with this fascinating and must-read book.

$REVIEW.: Because the only edition for this book is Kindle, I'm guessing that it's self-published. If so, it is sincerely one of the best self-published books I've read. It's well-edited, which might seem minor, but when a book is poorly edited, it doesn't matter how good the story is, because the errors interrupt the flow. In this case, the story was intriguing and did not prove to be as predictable as I feared (just small similarities to other stories I've read). The ending of the book came as a surprise, because a sneak peek of a sequel is included, but that's not a criticism, just an observation. (I look forward to getting the sequel, just based on how much I enjoyed the first book.)The description and the other reviews will cover the plot, so I'll not rehash. (I also want to avoid any spoilers!)

$review_text.: I thought this book was a good mystery and enjoyed it

I'd give South Beach Shakedown 4-stars except for the fact that it has some of the worst formatting of any Kindle book I've read which was distracting to me
I've seen a few with worse formatting, but those were so bad that I wouldn't even attempt to read them
This book was good enough to try to overlook the formatting.In most pages, the author uses neither paragraph indents or a line space between paragraphs so you are faced with a wall of text

On other pages, each line is interspersed with a short line of two or three words


Sometimes a sentence is split in the middle of the line, continuing on the next, etc., etc

There is no space after the period in many, many sentences causing the words to run together.Like this.He also never uses 'he said' or any other indication of who is speaking

That is mostly okay and not hard to follow, except that some paragraphs would include dialogue from more than one person which was confusing

Each chapter was entitled &#34;b&#34; and inexplicably, in the middle of many sentences or even in the middle of a word, there is &#34;southbeach shakedown don bruns 67&#34; or similar which I supposed indicates that the author or his publisher uploaded a draft copy by mistake and has never looked at it since.I was really surprised to come back to the book page and see that the Kindle edition was published in 2006
Has the author lost interest? I would have expected that the formatting would have been corrected by now
This is an example of how the raving 5-star reviews which mention no flaws do no service to the author.Anyway, I think this mystery is worth reading if you aren't bothered too much by poor formatting
I would read other books by this author.

$review_text.: Wow, I just found out about this book and ordered a copy right away.  After it arrived today, these are my thoughts.  First off, I am a huge fan of Jinny Beyer's work.  I have almost all of her other books and have been very influenced by her teaching books.  I learned to love and enjoy hand piecing because of Jinny and really appreciate her quilt designs with influences from India. For this book, I absolutely loved the very huge section on quilt grids!  Huge amounts of information to empower you to create your own block designs. That is hugely exciting to me, rather than feel stuck with something in a pattern that is same old, same old.  I get bored easily because quilting can feel very repetitive and monotonous but with the huge variety of quilt blocks, each one is a new adventure.  That section of the book is like a treasure chest to me. Ok, now here is some information on the book that you should be aware of.  The "finished" quilt blocks are probably made using computer software and digital copies of Jinny's fabric (I don't think each and everyone of these were actually made) - still a huge amount of work!  Second, while the book does have 5000 or so blocks (I didn't count but can easily imagine there are after flipping through the book), there might be 25 variations on a single block. Finally, there are no measurements or instructions for piecing the blocks, that is up to you to figure out. An unbelievable work of quilt scholarship, "The" authoritative reference on probably every quilt block known to man, and the fun of reading passages written by Jinny throughout the book.  If you don't feel you need this much information, Jinny is a very generous quilter and has provided many quilt block designs and patterns available on her website for free.

$REVIEW.: Soho Crime publishes several series set outside the US; e.g., Cara Black's Aimee Leduc series set in Paris, Leighton Gage's Mario Silva Brazil-based series, Rebecca Pawel's series set in Spain following the civil war, Magdalen Nabb's Marshal Guarnaccia series set in Florence and several others, including Garry Disher's Inspector Hal Challis series set on the Mornington Crescent south of Melbourne, Australia.  BLOOD MOON  is the fifth in the Hal Challis series and, like many other Soho Crime titles, it's in a compact hardcover with attractive cover art.The setting of the Hal Challis series is always a player in these titles.  The towns Challis and his team police are working class, but because they are also on the water, there are many wealthy people from Melbourne who snap up old beachfront and water view properties and tear them down to build mini-mansion weekend homes.  Teens from well-off families descend on the beach area for a week of sun and fun----including drinking, drugs, sex and troublemaking----each year when school lets out.  Conflicts between the residents and these visitors are featured prominently in BLOOD MOON.Challis and his team investigate the murder of a government employee responsible for enforcing land-use codes.  She has had numerous run-ins with newcomers tearing down old houses, overbuilding and ripping up protected vegetation that interferes with their views.  She suspected that her boss accepted bribes from the newcomers.  But maybe her murderer wasn't from her work life.  Maybe it was her obsessively jealous and controlling husband.Also under investigation is the beating of a private school chaplain.  The investigators soon find the chaplain has connections to a racist politician and is himself part of an extremist sect.  Was the chaplain's attacker one of the spoiled students who drove another school employee to a breakdown?  Someone connected with his political activities or his creepy church?As they carry out their investigations, the officers deal with a stream of problems caused by the partying teens and with their own personal issues.  One officer's wife has withdrawn from her family after joining the strange sect.  Hal is having some adjustment issues with his new relationship with Ellen Destry, a member of his team.  Ellen struggles with some old demons.  Pam Murphy begins a relationship with a cocky new member of the team, while her old work partner suspects the new guy is up to no good.Garry Disher writes excellent police procedurals with multi-threaded, but easy to follow plots.  He makes his characters very real, and gives us a good sense of his setting, its economy, politics and people.  I highly recommend this series.  It isn't absolutely critical to read the books in order.

It's just not my type of literature
I found it entertaining and read the whole thing


I read Wendell Berry's &#34;Jaber Crow&#34; that I enjoyed a lot, but now that I've read one of his books, I don't care to read any more at this time


&#34;Pastoralia&#34; is like that - I may not read George Saunders again, but you may like it a lot and read all of his books.

$REVIEW.: Sarah has presented a very well laid out guide or playbook in this case about finding the right guy. Being a dad with a daughter of course I want her to find a man that will treat her how she deserves to be treated. One of the main points I will share with my daughter from the books is:Once you have embraced who you are as a woman, and I mean truly accepted all of your perceived flaws as attractive traits that make you who you are, then suddenly you will be on track to attracting a man. But not just any man &#8211; the right man &#8211; and there is a difference!There are many other tips inside that I know will help her with finding someone who will respect her and treat her as she deserves to be treated. Besides if I tell her to date a specific type of guy she will be like any kid and do the exact opposite :).

$REVIEW.: I downloaded a sample of this,  and as a victim of rape/incest/pedophilia myself,  was wary about reading it as I find most authors' handling of subject matter uninformed and sensationalized at best - looks like they're just trying to get on bestsellers' list. That's why I started with only a sample.As soon as I opened the sample I was plunged into stunningly good storytelling with marvelously realistic characters: flawed,  courageous,  frightened,  daring,  full of misgivings and self-doubt. The protagonist Sarah is wonderful and having experienced childhood abuse and witnessing what she believes to be a child's abduction,  makes the daring yet insanely stupid choice of following the suspected abductor before/without notifying police since she's afraid their delay might endanger the little girl who's been kidnapped. IF a little girl has,  indeed,  been kidnapped and Sarah's not projecting her own painful history onto what she thinks she's seen.The plot is expertly managed,  never slowing down to let you catch your breath as it weaves back and forth among multiple players: Sarah,  the possible kidnapper,  Sarah's husband (who desperately wants to believe that his wife is not delusional but fears for her own safety as she recklessly follows what may be a very dangerous man), the police detectives (who wonder why this story is coming from a man who says his wife claims she thinks she saw a child being kidnapped and sent him to police rather that contacting them herself). You get the picture: multilayered,  complex,  morally ambiguous, riveting,  masterful storytelling.Tastefully handled so no sensationalism for inflated sales. Author is always in tight control of story.The only thing that prevented my giving this 5* instead of the 4.5* which I did give it was one plot element near end of book (don't worry: NO Spoilers) that I simply found not only unrealistic and contrived but demeaning to real victims of such crimes. This plot device has been used too many times and simply disappointed me because it seemed to be saying,  child predators aren't a real threat while the rest of the book clearly demonstrated, through its excellent characterization,  that they are. "Crime" solved a little too handily but the ending still a surprise.Great read,  wonderful pacing. Very good plot (except for one unrealistic detail, as noted above) & memorable,  fascinating characters who stay with you after you've put the book down.I'd definitely read future books by this author. 4.5*/5

$review_text.: Book two in the Darkness Falls series is just as disappointing as the first. There are no bad guys among the Draiochtans. If someone betray's their people, it's because they are really a Daemon shape shifter. If someone is selfish and leads their people astray it's because they are under a spell. Its okay to have bad guys among those who should be good. It's war, people are afraid, and greedy, they can redeem themselves later if at all.The way Kate uses her magic is comical. She just tells the sprites what to do. Like a rich housewife instructing the maid. It would be better if things just appeared or where done, than us reading her instructions. Character's die, but there is no connection to them. So even though they are supposed to major losses, there is no investment so as a reader I don't really care. The story really could have been wrapped up in this book. A third installment of this story is so unnecessary.

The characters aren't believable and were almost cartoonish.  The premise of the professor and student relationship was a good one, but the dialogue was weak.  I can't believe the review that called this a "well written" romance with believable characters that you meet in every day life.  I don't know anyone as sappy as Brandi or as confusing as Timothy Polaris.  Not to mention the "best friend" that's constantly telling Brandi that she wishes she could sleep with Tim or the "evil" Eric who is constantly lurking about and sneering at Tim/Brandi.  I read a LOT of IR bw/wm romances and this one doesn't make the cut.  Would not recommend it!

$REVIEW.: In his first novel Could You But Find It, Robert Cilley displays a distinctive and enjoyable voice, like an American Alexander McCall Smith. Curiously, Cilley is a judge, and McCall Smith a law professor. Could that account for the similar way of thinking and writing? Although the events in the book are thrilling, the narrative pace is measured, evoking leisurely Southern storytelling.The blurb really doesn't describe the book well. It's about a young man who comes into an unexpected inheritance of secrets and his three Clemson University classmates who help him in his journey. It's got an international scope, complete with black helicopters, and a touch of mysticism.I found it to be quite the page turner, and am looking forward to more fiction from Mr. Cilley. Why did I give it only three stars? First, I am pretty strict. Secondly, the final third of the book wasn't as energetic as the first part. The main characters' fates are secure, but the bad guys have yet to meet their comeuppance, and the full back history has to be revealed. With some collaborative editing, the three strands could have been better woven together to arrive at the end at the same time.

$REVIEW.: The story starts of with a group of three women wanting to find ways of making their life better thus forming the group called Committee of the Disaffected which focuses on witchcraft when they didn't find anything to do anymore. Their venture into witchcraft resulted in knowing about the demon who granted wishes and their deepest desires. They wanted that wish, and they got it. Did their wish gave them happiness or something else?When I first read the book, I was hooked of how easy to read it was. The characters were lovable with their independent charisma. Their story felt real because it's what everyday people experience and go through. I experience sympathy, I laughed, I gritted my teeth of anger, and I related with the characters. That's what I like in a book. But there are some points that I do want to point out. First, the story telling was quite slow, the book felt short because of that. The good part didn't come until half of the novel. Then when I was reading through the climax, I hoped it was expanded more. Cailey should have incorporated a witchcraft elements more. But regardless of the short comings, the book was an enjoyable read. I also love the lessons and realizations. I must admit, I loved that more than the witchcraft.Who can I recommend this book to? Almost everybody. This book is fun, easy to relate, and most especially has a great story.

$review_text.: The Promise of an AngelBy Ruth ReidRuth's first book in a series, entitled, "Heaven on Earth Series"  is an extremely different  novel about the Amish. I must admit, I was sceptical when I first started to read- it is not a subject that is normally addressed- you don't usually read about Amish folks seeing angels, so to me that was very far fetched, however I quickly became engrossed in this story. Ruth writes with passion and a very unique style.The setting is in Mescota County, Michigan in the home of a group of Old Order Amish.A barn raising for the family of Judith Fischer is the focus at the beginning of the story.  As the building proceeds, there is a tragic accident, in which Judith's young brother is severely injured.and may not walk again.This is where the excitement begins- Judith sees an angel who reassures her about the accident . This causes all kinds of challenges, as her intended, insists this cannot be true! Angels cannot be seen by humans. The angel continues to appear to Judith and give her advice. Andrew, another friend, seems to be the only one to believe her .Two young men, with two very different views. Who would Judith be happy with? Should she listen to the angel?I enjoyed the depth that Ruth put into all of the characters. You feel their pain and their confusion.Ruth is to be commended on her quick pace in the story. You have no time to be bored. There is constant action to think about.A great book for those who appreciate something different in Amish fiction!This book was supplied by Booksneeze in exchange for a review.

For any entrepreneur, the author's guidance is the best you can find -- clear, experienced and, more than anything, critically honest

With so much energy and money whirling  about, I can think of no better 150 pages that cuts through the noise and  gets to the creativity that has made Silicon Valley a place of innovation.Lastly, there is also wonderfully practical advice in this story


I have  advised numerous start-ups in developing business plans and pitchs, this  has as good of a template as there is.

Also she wasn't afraid of her own sexuality which most heroine's are, she looks at things from a biological perspective which is me exactly. Will definately recommend this to anyone who likes action, awesome sex, and downright good writing. Kudos to the author for creating a great escape.

$review_text.: This book was awesome!  I love a good fighter romance and this one was really fantastic!  This book had me hooked from the first page and I couldn't put it down.  I think the thing I liked the most was the humor.  There were a couple laugh-out-loud moments.  I really loved Jack - so sexy!  A cop and a fighter - such a sexy combination.  Crissy is smart, funny and sweet and her and Jack together were so hot!  I loved that there wasn't any stupid drama and the the storyline was fast paced and interesting.  I really loved this book and can't wait to read more in this series!  Highly recommend!

$review_text.: It is hardly fair to review a book you have not read, so let me be clear about that in the beginning: I did not read this book. Yet that in itself says something about the book, as I read about twenty percent of it and decided to not go on....Lacking dialogue and scenes, it seemed much more like a summary than a story. Lacking this kind of immediacy, the book failed to draw me in.  And I stopped.

$review_text.: It's not a happy story...the title doesn't lie

But the depth of understanding Ms


Hartzenberg  grasps here is undeniable
The night sky...the deep tunnels...the loss...the emptiness...the song
It's rich, meaningful stuff

Having lost a close family member to suicide (the sixth anniversary of which just passed a couple of weeks ago), it also struck a close chord with me
Pain lives on for those who survive a loved one's suicide
The song never ends.Good short stories pack a one-two punch without any distraction
This one does not disappoint.

$SUMMARY.: Suicide is not painless...

$REVIEW.: This action packed book is not a sci-fi paranormal as I thought when I saw the cover. No werewolves, vampires or magic in this story, but that does not mean its lacking anything. This book is smart, fun and funny. Ms. Hawkes makes you smell the land, hear the atmosphere and fall deeply in love with her characters from chapter one. No angsty communication misunderstandings or love triangles in this book. And while the love story is the major plot line,...it also isn't. I highly recommend this book to anyone 14+.

Bree finding escape, only to meet Archer who is has lost his voice but not his ability to love.  Im getting goose bumps just typing thinking about the story.  This is hands down one of the most beautiful stories I have EVER read.  It touched my heart in places I didn't know could be touched.  Who wraps up angst, love, heartbreak and determination through ALL odds...Mia Sheridan does, that's who.  WONDERFUL story.

$REVIEW.: I started reading India Drummond's 'Blood Faerie' on a noisy plane, but within seconds I was drawn into the world of Eilidh and the mystery surrounding the strange murders in a small Scottish town. A faerie who has been cast out for using forbidden magic, Eilidh watches humans from a distance. But when the murders continue and she might have the powers to stop them, she can't help but get involved. Drummond skilfully intertwines human and faerie worlds, drawing the reader easily into both the delights and horrors each entails. Quite often in books such as these, I feel bogged down by all the rules and rituals of the world the author has created. I never felt that way here -- every detail unfolds in such a natural way I could almost believe faeries do exist! If you're looking for a compelling, well written mystery with a touch of romance, I highly recommend this book. Having read Drummond's debut novel 'Ordinary Angels' as well as this one, I can't wait to see what's next!

$review_text.: Beloved Purgatory is the second book in the Fallen Angels series, following After Eden.  Much like the first book, I was completely drawn into the story from the moment it began.  The use of angels and demons and devils is unique, not following all of the stereotypes associated with those beings.  There is an interesting underlying theme of morality and the ambiguity of "good" vs."evil", and all the gray areas in between.  I liked that lack of delineation because it added layers to the plot.I love Devi as a the heroine of the story.  She has had a life of misery and has never really known what it is like to be truly happy.  There is a sense of optimistic hopelessness about her character, an oxymoron, I know.  It is as if, no matter the constant sense of sadness, she has hope that someday, around some corner, happiness exists.  Oz, her boyfriend (and a demon) doesn't fit any of the stereotypes that pop culture holds about demons.  He is funny, sexy, caring, and more than a little wacky and can't help but love him.  But he also is dark and mysterious, with secrets and sadness of his own.  All of the characters are perfectly created and truly make the story.Like the first book, I couldn't put the book down once I started.  There was less romance in this book between Oz and Devi, but much more suspense and action.  Many of the blanks about Devi were filled in over the course of the book, telling much more of her story.  One of my favorite subplots was the interplay between Devi and her mom, bringing a little of the mundane emotional drama in alongside the paranormal.The third book will be out some time in 2012 and I can't wait for it!
$SUMMARY.: Absolutely fabulous sequel!

$REVIEW.: I couldn't sleep last night, so I grabbed my kindle and began reading Weirder Than Marshmallows which contains a series of essays and rants by the Dan Fogg, who sadly passed away over ten years ago.The writings are based on the author's observation of the stupidity of humanity. In the preface, Dan talks about the ingredients of marshmallows and wonders why there is blue food coloring in it. After reading the ingredients, I'm never eating a marshmallow again.Normally I don't read essay books, but I really enjoyed reading Weirder Than Marshmallows as the author used common sense that seems to be lacking in our culture today. I've never noticed the "Not Stop on Tracks" sign at railroad tracks before, but I'll look for them the next time I cross one.I laughed aloud as I read each humorous essays that dealt with real life situations. I'm a Garfield fan, so I got a kick out of the incident with his mother's Garfield watch. The essay about the girl who couldn't figure out how to heat a Hot Pocket, reminded me of my cousin, who would have done the exact same thing. Dan must have been an intelligent and funny person to write a short, but perfect book. I'm sadden to hear about his passing as he had a bright future in writing. I recommend Weirder Than Marshmallows to everyone!

The only issue I had was that the dialogue did not seem terribly authentic at times....while I know that the author might not like using foul language, it takes away from an otherwise realistic story...soldiers in battle are going to curse and use colorful metaphors..that is part of the military culture.

$REVIEW.: You can find the text of Tyndale's translation here: [...]- but there is something very satisfying about reading a copy of one of the actual 1526 Tyndale New Testaments! It takes 5-10 minutes to get used to reading the text, but with a bit of mental adjustment, it isn't hard at all. I agree with the reviewer who said Tyndale's was more 'modern' than the KJV. It was a very plain, 'common', and forceful translation. Odd as it sounds for someone who only recently bought a KJV after 40 years of using modern translations, I'll be reading regularly from Tyndale's.The binding is typical for this price range - if I had to do it over, I might opt for the hardback version.

The Autobots are exiled to a dead Cybertron, and with them out of the way Megatron starts, and wins, his war against humanity!The art style here will blow your mind! Great drawing and coloring will make the destruction all the more epic as you witness the full unleashed fury of the enemy.The story is dark, dark stuff. I didn't even know you could make a dark TF story and do it well, bu this proves it! When Frenzy starts drilling into soldiers with his hands, while screaming and being making them envision their own worst nightmares, you'll get just how screwed humanity is in this story.This collects the first 6 comic issues in one book, and what a book it is! The art gallery in the back is a nice bonus.Needless to say, if you've always wanted the baddies to win, and are fed up with the omni-victorious good guys, this is a story you need to read.

I hung on EVERY SINGLE WORD, anticipating and reading what was to come. Wanting revenge, wanting destruction, not knowing how it would happen. I could go into her back story, but it&#8217;s better for Sammi to tell you herself. She is much more eloquent than I. Just know that it&#8217;s a doozy, and it is guaranteed to rip your heart out. You will wonder how there are human beings on this earth that exist as they do. Vile creatures that revel in the suffering of others, you won&#8217;t be the least bit upset if and when they get their comeuppance. And Sammi aims to deliver it up close and personal.~ It&#8217;s ironic, really. That, cunning as they all are, they don&#8217;t realize their judge, jury and executioner stands before them, painted in roses and ink. ~Right out of the gate it becomes very apparent that the tone of this book series will be gritty and raw. Sammi plays the part well, and even though she does some morally reprehensible things herself, you understand why. You can empathize with her, you feel her pain. As I mentioned before, this book has a uniqueness that was very refreshing, especially coming from a debut author! This is the first book in a serial and I cannot wait to see what unfolds next!

 This book gives you answers, EVERY EMOTION, and is literally impossible to put down once you start! My jaw was literally on the floor at one point, and I was wanting to scream at the characters at other points


I was anxious, happy, angry, sad, hurt, hopeful, surprised, excited, worried, elated, and completely engrossed while reading Seamless
True to form, RL Griffin totally delivered in the aspect of a great, suspenseful plot, sincere in depth characters that you literally care about, and doesn't give you the usual predictable outcomes

I cannot say enough good things about this author and this series
It has been my absolute favorite
I am unfortunately terribly sad that it is the end of the road for some of these characters

However, I am looking forward to reading more about the other characters in future books!!!! Thank you RL Griffin for allowing us all to live Stella's story

$REVIEW.: I loved KI Thompson's first two books and like the previous reader couldn't wait for her next one.  Unfortunately this one just didn't cut it for me.  I became very frustrated with the antics of Addy and her brother and,in fact, with just about everyone in this book.  There were a few laugh out loud moments but not many.  I do credit KI for at least trying something different. I'm just sorry it didn't turn out better.Humor is very achievable in lesbian fiction--read the wonderful Julia Watts.  I'm sure KI will have a wonderful next book out in 2010, perhaps something comperable to "House of Clouds".  What a bummer we have to wait so long!!!

$REVIEW.: Kim Diehl presents us with one more fine book in her "Simple" series


 I already own "Simple Seasons", so I snapped up the new "Simple Comforts" as soon as I saw it.These "Simple" books tend toward traditional patterns done in strong colorations with just the right mix of color and contrast, and not TOO much applique

 Ms
Diehl's style also lends itself very well to scrappyness, and "Simple Comforts" is a wonderful resource to inspire you to finally deal with those scraps.The Table of Contents page provides thumbnail photos of each of the 12 quilt patterns, which is a most helpful editing technique that I wish all publishers would utilize
 You instantly see the full range Diehl's colorful interpretation of traditional patterns.Of course, you can make these quilts using really modern/mod fabrics, and there is one particular quilt - "Checkerberry Bliss" - that is a great exercise in contrast in black and light greens

 My favorite is "Twilight Hopscotch", a really lovely star/chain variation in tone-on-tone greens on neutral; I am thinking of making this one first to use as a shower curtain.Scattered throughout the book are Diehl's "Pin Points", which are helpful insets which offer handy technique tips

 Also worth noting: each pattern includes directional arrows for "proper" seam pressing, which I rely on to help me best-match pieced seams.I look forward to more "Simple" books from Kim Diehl; whether this is your first of her books or not, I think this one will inspire those of us who prefer colorful yet still largely traditional patterns
 "Simply" a winner!!

$REVIEW.: Classic movies are often remade with current actors and a few modern twists so why not modernize a classic children's fairytale? Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, The Millennium Fulcrum Edition does just this. I love the original by Lewis Carroll but I really enjoyed this version and appreciate the author's contemporary take on an old classic. Illustrations are new, fresh, colorful and were a pleasant bonus to my reading experience.

$review_text.: This is the second Carson book I have read (the first was&#34;America the Beautiful&#34;), and I am convinced that Ben Carson should be our next President.  He knows what the United States needs at this time is to return to our former prominence in the World and also end our secular progressive spiral to disaster.  He discusses many subjects currently vital to our future and being a God fearing Christian has the right answers to what our future path should become.  He has not stated that he &#34;is running&#34; but only that if he feels at some point that he should, he will do so!  I agree with his views on; same sex marriage, abortions, education, world responsibilities, economics, informed electorate, and cooperation in Congress in order to get the important things done for our great country.  Read his book with an open mind and evaluate, for yourself, what he has to say about fixing what is broken today in the United States of America.

$REVIEW.: Kathryn is a young girl who finds herself under a pile of college debt. She gets talked into working as a bar server in a high end BDSM club. She sees things happening around her every night but she tunes it out. It is not for her. She is called into her boss's office one night and given the chance to "pay off all her loans " if she agrees to spend the night being a sub for a very rich Dom.  I could not believe that Kathryn, who was not into BDSM, could turn into a submissive in just a few hours. How she could suddenly be turned on by calling someone "Master". How she could fall into the lifestyle after one sex act and then chase after and fall at the feet of her "Master", begging him to take her home. He does end up taking her to his house and she becomes part to this harem complete with a type of Madam who helps whip the "girls" into shape. Not a hot read or believable.I deleted from my Kindle.

$REVIEW.: 1915, The Western Front. Dr John Watson has come to a Flanders field hospital to demonstrate a radical new method for blood transfusion. The scale and savagery of the slaughter threatens to overwhelm his sensibilities but, when he is presented with a corpse that bears all the hallmarks of murder, and it becomes clear that the murderer has struck before and will strike again, he must spring into action, using all that he has learnt at the hands of his famous companion.Since Anthony Horowitz'sHouse of SilkI've been on the lookout for good quality Holmes homages, but it's surprising just how thin on the ground they actually are. This, however, is a real contender. Ryan has written a thrilling whodunnit/adventure that meets all the requirements of a good Holmesian tale... bar one - there's no Sherlock Holmes! Well, that's not entirely true but, after a friendship-breaking disagreement, Watson is left pretty much alone to solve this deadly mystery. I suppose that Holmes fans may be put off by that twist, but I recommend that they persist, because this is an exceptionally well researched tale and very nicely written. Ryan's diligence really comes through in the telling and there's lots of fascinating detail about WW1 trench warfare and about the treatment of the casualties that the Great War produced in such prolific numbers. The backdrop of Edwardian labour unrest and suffrage bring a three dimensionality to Dead Man's Land which make it an absorbing read. It did what few books have managed recently; it kept me awake well into the wee hours.The writing is clean and competent albeit somewhat dispassionate and the characterisation is diverse and well realised. I wouldn't claim to be a Holmes fan - at least not a dedicated one - but I am sufficiently familiar with ACD's works that I at least am satisfied with Ryan's addition to the milieu. True, Holmes himself barely features, and when he does he is much diminished by age. That he has feet of clay may be a disappointment to his followers but Watson is dynamic and believable and I can't imagine that his fans will have too much to complain about. That Dead Man's Land has moved on from the traditional Victorian setting separates the story neatly from the main body of work, and gives Ryan room to play with the characters and to take a few liberties here and there. Nevertheless he reamins solidly faithful and it can be imagined that ACD would approve.This is a compelling and enjoyable murder mystery and it is very highly recommended.Look out for the sequel,The Dead Can Wait.

Her lead couple has definite chemistry, it is easy to make the emotional connection to them and you will find yourself invested in their journey to happily ever after. The pacing is fast, the story is very well plotted and the dialogue quite clever. There is definitely passion and romance, I loved it.*I received my copy from NetGalley.com in exchange for an honest review.

Jessica returns home ready to put the past behind and let her life as a single mom begin, but her new plans are quickly derailed when she meets Detective Mick Landers after her son goes missing temporarily.Mick has never had the reaction he has with Jessie, but he is smitten no doubt about it.  As a detective he knows how to handle situations and he seems to have one with Jessie who has no problem being alone with him, but he wants more including being a part of her family and she is making it difficult for him to prove how much he cares for her and her family.I liked this story a lot, I thought the introduction with friends kind of baring all was a perfect way to get you to understand Jessie.  Mick is fabulous and patient with Jessie trying to be understanding to her needs.  There is one really fun scene in this book that had me chuckling quite a bit.  Great story.

$REVIEW.: Dante &#34;Inferno&#34; Jones you are so hot..

OH YEAH!!!!Not only that but you have given me hope that all hottie MMA fighters are no complete egotistical man-whores


You are hot, oozing sex appeal, sweet and so not stereotypical
Although you did have women throwing snatch in your face everywhere you went, you saw something in Caitlyn that others never stopped to see

They only saw what was on the outside never taking time to stop and see who she really is.Richard well he was my exact depiction of the MMA man- whore but so much worse, Paul me it too he was a creep big time....major danger on the creep o meter!!Every time he tried to cut Caitlyn  down by using  her weight against her only had me seeing red, I wanted to....straight out kick you in the ball sack and watch you scream like a little girl!!!! Seriously just SHUT UP!!! You waste precious oxygen every time you breathe.People like you and Amanda just simply disgust me.I was so proud of the way that Dante stood up for Cait when others would try to bring her down


Knowing how big of a issue her wait was and I totally understand her not seeing herself as others see her, she only sees what she was before, she lacked the confidence to see herself as anything more than the overweight girl she was
But beauty is in the eye of the beholder and Dante thought she held the moon and to him she was beautiful and he loved her for her despite her imperfections.Yes I did get frustrated and upset With Cait because she was so caught up thinking Dante could want nothing more than a fling with her she was missing all the things he was saying to her
He laid it out time and time again but she kept pushing him away
I'm so glad he was hard headed and kept after her.Amy was a great friend, Paul was awesome, he had me....cracking up!!!!I'm so happy that I got my HEA

It would of seriously pissed me off if not


They deserve each other, now I wann know more, about his career, their wedding, babies


Ill take it all please.I had no doubts when this book was released that I would read it, seriously a MMA fighter

Arrogant or not still love em.Extreme love is a story of, self-discovery, letting go, facing your demons, trust, and love.To the author...kudos!!!! You done awesome.Thank you for getting my blood pumping and making me....HAPPY DANCE!!!!

$REVIEW.: Like several other reviewers I have been curious about the speed with which South Vietnam collapsed in 1975, and I picked up this book to try to get some answers.  With an abundance of documentation and detail, Mr. Veith analyzes each step of the process by which North Vietnam finally conquered (or liberated, depending on your politics) South Vietnam.  His writing is clear and straightforward, and the book includes nearly enough maps, although the one map of the entire country is too small.  He includes several helps for militarily challenged readers such as myself:  a list of acronyms, a &#34;cast list&#34; of important persons on both sides with their assignments during 1973-5, and a description of the various military units involved.Even with these aids, this book was a real slog to finish.  The level of detail could be numbing, and I frequently found myself skimming.  At times it felt as though I was reading a shopping list of every single engagement. It was hard to tell the difference between the strategically important battle and the encounter that was included for completeness.Despite the tone of the preceding paragraph, this is a positive review.  With all the effort it took, I got clear answers as to what led to the fall of Saigon.  I also got a new appreciation for the fog of war, the strategic decision-making processes on both sides, and the determination of the officers and soldiers who fought.  For that reason alone, I can recommend this book.

Slade is a very alpha, very sexy and very...experienced male stripper and let me tell you I want to meet this man!! Yes I enjoyed the book mainly for him but there was an amazing story to back it up! He is leading a life that everyone thinks is wrong for him but he doesn't care...that is until he meets Aspen and his world crashes down around him.I don't want to give to much away about this story so I will just let you know how it made me feel. It made me horny! Damn the man is so good his powers worked from the pages of this book...I don't know how Aspen held out! It would have been a much shorter story if I had been involved! ;)But the extremely hot man aside this book was fantastic!

My wife and I have been to Peru, and many of the sights detailed in this book, and would strongly recommend to anyone that while they still have their health they should fly down, spend a few weeks and see for themselves Lake Titicaca, Machu Picchu, Cuzco, take a private plane over the Nazca lines, etc.. David points out time and again what I came away with after listening to the various tour guides, &#34;The modern archeologists don't know what they're talking about!&#34; The Incas didn't build any of this! Who would (and with what?) cut such enormous blocks of granite to such specific dimensions, drag them down and up tremendous mountains and then fit them in so tightly that a razor blade cannot fit between any two stones? Some of these boulders weigh hundreds of thousands of pounds! Any civilization of the last 5000 years (including modern man) does not have the capabilities to create such structures! In fact any rational civilization would conclude, &#34;We've got to construct with 'smaller stones'!&#34; Still, we must ponder because these stones and the formations created are 'real', &#34;Who did this, and why?&#34;

$review_text.: The stone has kept a fairly decent record about life in the past, but I think it is far from telling us the whole story.  Of course the fossil record is subject to mountain ranges  being destroyed by erosion, Oceanic plates being destroyed at the trenches along with other factors of nature that keeps it's fossil record history to itself.  But, there is an adequate fossil information to confirm Charles Darwin Evolutionary Theory along with Transitional forms from free swimming worms to fish, fish to amphibians, amphibians to reptiles and from reptiles to mammals and birds as Charles Darwin predicted.  In the last 50 years, the fossil record has clearly revealed the Evolution of the Human species (Homo Sapiens) going back at least 6 million years.  Those that deny Evolution are quickly losing there fall back position of insufficient fossils for Evolution and/or  Transitional forms.I would recommend it anyone that wants to know how Earth and Life sciences get there information in which to tell the story of the history of life and earth.

$review_text.: A very interesting read, albeit for those who are not easily swayed by what the official interpretations say otherwise. The first half of the book was very interesting, kept you wondering how and where the ending would lead. While I am a bit skeptical of the Warren Commission findings on JFK, the book raises another question: how did the CIA keep a lid on those who knew much more than they felt was necessary. In the case of Mary Pinchot Meyer, the mystery remains as to how important her knowledge was to the CIA and possibly others who knew more about the JFK assassination. An interesting read, for sure!

$review_text.: Anyone who has spent even just ten minutes in therapy and/or has one remotely sensitive bone in their body does not need to read this book.  The title should have been "Parenting From The Inside Out:  Duh, Your Past Experiences Inform Your Relationships And If You Don't Know That Then You Are Not Old Enough To Be A Parent".I found that the one author's recount of coldly stabbing sick children with needles during his internship, uncaring to their cries of pain, lent more insight into the way HIS mind worked and why someone like him would desperately need a book like this.  The self-congratulatory tone makes it all the worse.Any kind and caring reader who is in touch with their own feelings and understands themselves is wasting their money.  If you want to know how the brain works on a technical level (also included in the book) you can get just as much info on Wikipedia and save yourself the dough ... and a more than a few eye-rolls.

(As have most of us) I was disappointed in her last book, which I felt was a conglomeration of every style out there


She has found herself again and settled down into her recognizable personal style in this book


It is a very effective mix of her signature soft look while at the same time accommodating the roughness of the Texas prairie
This book has the confident Rachel Ashwell look and style we have come to expect

I gave this review a 4 rather than a 5 because several of the pictures were so obviously "staged" rather than simply capturing life as it is naturally on "The Prairie".

$REVIEW.: This is the first tech-themed coffee table book that I have seen, and it's a nice one. The book is laid out like a thick hard-covered version of Wired magazine. Thick with pictures and clever layout, with relatively sparse text.There is a little something to love for almost any fringe Macintosh group or phenomenon. There is a section on tattoos, Apple wear, the iPod, the Newton. Another small section links the Mac to pot. And a very cool section shows prototype Macintoshs of the future designed by enthusiasts. Another interesting section analyses Macintoshes in movies and tv, where the good guy is always Mac and the bad guy always uses a PC.This is not a serious history of the development of the Macintosh. Other books have covered that. The book rarely gets deep into issues. It's about a phenomenon. About defining the phenomenon and rallying behind it, as opposed to decomposing it. It's a fun, self-validating read for Mac lovers.This would make a perfect Christmas gift for your favorite Mac enthusiast. And it may make a good read for any Windows lover who is puzzled by the cult-like Mac owners.

I really connected with Ellie in this book, more so than any of the other Artists Trilogy novels.  I felt like I was a part of her, struggling with her emotions and actions throughout Bold Tricks.  Camden was awesome as always. Camden can do no wrong in my opinion. And Javier has become one of my favorite villains.

I am excited about the spin offs that will be coming in the future for Ford and Spencer.The Trio of men, Spencer, Ford, and Ronin...what a trio. We learn a lot more about what they have done in the past.

$REVIEW.: During the Cold War, both the United States and the Soviet Union deployed a number of competing weapon systems which they never used against each other directly, but which saw combat in proxy wars elsewhere. In terms of ground forces, the U.S.-built M60A1 tank and the Soviet-built T-62 tank were more or less equivalent armored competitors and saw service against each other in both the 1973 Yom Kippur War and the 1991 Gulf War. The two co-authors bring a good deal of knowledge and common sense to the task of outlining the competition between the M60A1 and the T-62 but unfortunately, their narrative does not fit well into the Duel format. Essentially, five armies (Egypt, Israel, Iraq, U.S. and Soviet) are covered over a period of three decades, which leads to a rather thin coherence. Since the authors regard the rival U.S. and Soviet tank technology development as a `Duel," a large chunk of the narrative is reduced to a programmatic history rather than the normal force-on-force story lines in the Duel series. The tactical narratives are adequate, but not at the level of depth that readers in this series would typically expect. Overall, this is an attractive but somewhat unsatisfying volume. As a former M60A3 TTS tanker myself, I found that there was a vital "something" that was missing from the discussion of this weapon system.The opening sections discuss the design and development of the M60 and T-62 tanks, which entered service in 1960-62 and both were considered as interim designs until more advanced tanks could be produced.  The next section covers the Battle of Chinese Farm on October 17, 1973, specifically the Egyptian 25th Tank Brigade (T-62s) versus the Israeli 600th Tank Brigade (M60A1s), which resulted in a one-side Israeli victory. There's both good, bad and irrelevant in this section. The authors effectively drive home identifying superior Israeli crew training as the primary cause of their success, but this is hardly a unique perspective and has been covered in depth before.  Too much of this section focuses on operational-level combat appropriate to a Campaign-series volume, but insufficient tactical detail for a Duel-series.  It is also clear from this section that the authors only have a "book" understanding of tank versus tank combat, particularly in their criticism of excessive Israeli tank commander casualties caused by fighting "unbuttoned." The Israelis realized that situational awareness is a vital perquisite in tank versus tank combat and their commanders were trained to fight - as German panzer commanders had been taught - with their heads out of the cupola and scanning the horizon with binoculars and Mark I eyeball. The Soviets foolishly taught their Egyptian and Iraqi pupils to fight buttoned up, with heads inside the turret. Yes, a good number of Israeli commanders were hit by artillery or fragments, but many more Egyptian commanders never saw what hit them. Having operated briefly in "buttoned up" mode in an M60A3, I can attest that visibility through the cupola vision blocks and daylight sights is far too narrow to provide good situational awareness.After Chinese Farm, the authors delve into a 10-page section on tank developments between 1973 and 1990. Some of this was interesting, but much of it appears to be a diversion and some was irrelevant (e.g. M60s used by the Iranians in Iran-Iraq War).  Again, the authors lose a bit of credibility on some technical issues, referring to tank track as "treads" and appearing to believe that gun stabilization on the M60A1 enabled real "shoot on the move." Without a laser rangefinder, shoot on the move was still pretty difficult and even on the M60A3 we employed `track pad crawl" to shoot at about 5 mph. Anything above that speed and the reticule is jumping around too much to give a good chance of first round hit. The authors also miss an important point here about U.S. crew training - which emphasized 2 rounds out in 5 seconds and three rounds out in 11 seconds. Soviet/Iraqi tankers were much slower in aiming and firing, which gave a crucial advantage to all U.S. tankers.  They also claim that Israeli Blazer armor when to equip the M60 battalions in Korea but I was in 2-72 AR at this time and we did not have any reactive armor.The final section on Desert Storm covers the USMC M60A1 battalions versus the Iraqi 3rd Armored Division (mostly T-62s), but it is more of a brigade-level overview than a turret-level account.  Too much of this section focused on secondary issues like M60 versus mines, which is irrelevant to the Duel equation. Much of the tank versus tank combat includes U.S. M1A1s and Iraqi T-55/72s as well, which really waters down the core rivalry between M60 and T-62. At the end, the authors deduce that the Marine M60s clobbered the Iraqis T-62s (exact statistics unknown) and that crew training was the deciding factor - but that has already been covered in many other Desert Storm accounts. I really couldn't see the value-added content here. The authors continued to demonstrate a certain user-level ignorance about tanks throughout the Desert Storm section, such as mentioning that one M60A1 went into combat with an inop fire control computer. That's why they teach degraded mode! Probabably a third of the M60A1s had a deadline fault (brake crush washers, gaskets on turret accumulator, etc). Graphically, this volume is appealing with color plates of each tank,2 maps, interior cutaway views of each tank's turret, gunsight views, 3 tables, and a battle scene from Desert Storm. Essentially, this Duel was just too amorphous to really fit well into this format.

They fell in love extremely quickly and the H's playboy status didn't really match his sudden devotion to the h. I know that stranger things have happened but I just didn't really buy the author's reasons for why the h was different to the zillion other women who fell for the H's charms.

$REVIEW.: First, I am not a financial analyst or even a very sophisticated investor. I just wanted to know what happened and, after reading this book, I think I know. Ms Gelinas is a financial analyst and seems to have spent quite a bit of time thinking about what happened and how we might start to put things back together. It began with the changes in banking in the 1980s, largely I believe (although she does not say so) due to inflation. For decades, the savings and loan had a business model of borrowing from savers at four percent interest and lending to homeowners at six percent interest. All that changed when inflation drove those savers, including me, to look for higher returns to compensate for the loss of value from inflation. Most of the evil that followed, in my opinion not hers, can be traced to this phenomenon. Now that I have demonstrated how naive I am, let's consider her book.She describes the history of the crash in 1929 as a consequence of irrational exuberance and unregulated financial manipulation during the 1920s. She describes, for example, the fall of Sam Insull who built Commonwealth Edison into a modern utility but lost track of all the financing until, in the wake of 1929, it collapsed and took thousands of savers' investments with it. She compares Insull to Enron, a valid comparison, I think. She describes the regulatory steps that were taken by Roosevelt's administration and how it stabilized the financial world for 70 years.The story of the 2008 collapse begins in 1984 with the rescue of the Continental Illinois Bank. Here began the "too big to fail" story. Two things happened here that led to the crisis. One was the decision to bail out all depositors, including those whose deposits exceeded the FDIC maximum. Secondly, the FDIC guaranteed the bond holders, as well. Thus began the problem of moral hazard. Another feature of this story was the role of Penn Square Bank, which had gone under two years earlier in the wake of the oil price collapse, which devastated many of its poorly collateralized loans in the oil industry. Both banks had been caught seeking higher returns through risky investments. Penn Square, however, had been allowed to collapse. Continental was rescued and that began a trend that the author lays out in detail through most of the rest of the book. It was here, in Chapter three, that I began to underline and take notes. Continental had relied on large amounts of short term money from uninsured depositors. That would be seen again and again in the years to come.The fact that large banks would be rescued placed small banks at a disadvantage and they complained. Congress, in the first of many well intentioned but useless measures, passed a bill that prohibited the FDIC from protecting uninsured depositors but they added the fatal proviso that exempted "systemic risk" situations. At this point, Charles Schumer, then a Congressman, opposed allowing banks to enter the securities business. The 1984 legislation ignored his concern and the wall was lifted a bit between investment banks and conventional banks. By 1999, when the Glass Steagall Act was largely repealed, Schumer had switched his position to favor the change.The investment banks took a major step as they became publicly traded companies. This began with Dean Witter in 1972 and Morgan Stanley took the step in 1986. Now, the traders would be risking someone else's money and this was a fateful decision. The author points out that Brown Brothers Harriman remained a partnership in which partners risk their own capital and it has not gotten into trouble with the speculation of the 90s and beyond. By 1993, the six largest commercial banks earned 40% of their profits in trading.  Corporate financial services became a larger and more powerful part of the economy. I'm sure I am not the only one who has noted the coming and going of major New York financial figures to and from administrations of both parties.The next step was the securitization of debt, especially home mortgages but also credit card debt and auto loans. She points out how this resembles Insull and Enron in that long term obligations were rolled into securities and sold to acquire immediate profits. No longer did banks service their own loans. More money could be earned by lending the money several times over.  Initially, the risk of the securitized mortgages was early retirement of the debt to refinance at lower rates. In 1986, a drop in interest rates brought an early crisis. At the time, no one dreamed that the next big crisis would be not the risk of early repayment but the risk of default.She describes the junk bond phenomenon and the development of derivatives. Finally comes the credit default swaps and the stage was set. An opportunity was missed in 1999 and 2000 when the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Brooksley Born, tried to regulate over-the-counter derivatives. Congress passed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, which barred such regulation and set the stage for the next act, the real estate bubble and collapse. By 2000, the unregulated OTC derivatives markets, which had not existed a decade before, totaled $95 trillion. These were unregulated and there were no margin or capital requirements.I would have to summarize the whole book, which is only 250 pages, to describe all the points she makes about how this happened. Read it yourself. I will summarize her suggestions for next steps now that the fall has taken place.An opportunity was missed in the summer of 2008 when Merrill Lynch sold some mortgage backed assets at 22 cents on the dollar. The price was low but nobody knew what the right price was. Allowing these fire sales to proceed would begin to establish a market for these securities. The TARP plan put a stop to this as no one would sell to private bidders when the government would pay a higher price. That was a big mistake and it was soon decided to merely give the banks the money as valuation proved impossible without a market. Some banks that were not in dire straits were forced to take money to conceal which banks were the most shaky. All these were mistakes. Artificially inflated asset values are part of the problem and will delay resolution.There needs to be a mechanism for bankruptcy of these interconnected institutions. She discusses some options. The markets have been weakened by changes in contract law, especially the Chrysler bailout when senior creditors were forced to the back of the line. She points out that there would have been no outcry about AIG bonuses if the company had been liquidated in some modified bankruptcy proceeding. She wants better disclosure of risk and part of that is regulation of all the exotic derivative products that will remain. There is no possibility that we could go back to the era of Glass Steagall. Times have changed. To big to fail must end. With all the interlocking financial instruments like CD Swaps and other derivatives, that will require a complex system to unwind such networks. On page 177, she recommends a division of failed institutions into two entities, one holding the toxic assets. I believe this is the Swedish "Bad Bank" concept although she doesn't use that term.The bubble was also stimulated by errors on the part of bond rating agencies that "rented" their AAA ratings, in her estimation. This allowed abuse of the securitization process as tranches of weak loans were sold paired with tranches of "good" loans and the capital requirements differed between the "good" or AAA rated tranches and the lower rated tranches. When the crisis came, the ratings did not work and she recommends that capital requirements for institutions holding such instruments be the same regardless of rating.For a very inexperienced amateur in finance, this has been a very interesting book and a quick read although I have marked places to read again. I could also see it as very useful for college courses in basic finance. I highly recommend it.

$review_text.: I've never been much of witchcraft when I was a teen, but this was so cool! NOTHING like how I thought the book would be like :)The book starts off with 2 friends, Isabel and Tripp playing around one Friday night
Tripp tries to do a summoning and lo and behold - a strange teenage boy falls from the sky and lands in the circle of salt right in the middle of Isabel's bedroom!When Isabel stands up to defend herself, she finds out that Tripp has no idea who Isabel is talking about


But Isabel can see and hear this stranger


And no one knows why.Isabel and Tripp decide to go to Tripp's grandmother whom happens to own a witchcraft shop, and ask her for help.When Alora (Tripp's Grandmother) begins her own summonsing for an Angel to take this boy towards the light - we learn that it is not his time.


This boy (Marc) has a quest he needs to conquer, and being tied to Isabel (literally with a 5 foot long orange rope) because Isabel was suppose to be there to help him.This book was way cute in many ways - When Marc learns there is a lot more to Isabel's life then the furry she directs at him constantly.Marc trying to help her by fighing the "low spirits" (those were spooky) and of course Tripp.


Her personality was just awesome!Isabel and Tripp try their best to help out Marc with learning about his life and death

To try to help him finish his quest, but it seems like everything is against them.I really enjoyed reading this book
It had a lot of twists to it to keep you guessing how Marc died, and what's going to happen next.I also really liked seeing the illistrations on each chapter :)Defiantly going to be looking out for book 2 - Witches Vs Wizards' That comes out in November 2011 :)

$review_text.: Exotic space, broken languages, sand for toilet paper, 40 days away from what you know and whom you love, such is the inner and outer world of the Sahara desert that Michael Benanav draws you into in his book, Men of Salt


 Unlike other adventure books that celebrate the challenge between the mind and the physical, Men of Salt is so much more than that


 Benanev in order to enter the desert must leave behind who he is, his girlfriend, and his identity as a Jew
 He must leave behind all manner physical comforts -- including when to wake, when to sleep and when to eat


 As he learns to rein the literal camel that he is riding, he discovers that he must also rein in the stallion of his mind which would rather quit or be in control but can do neither.Benanev is a brilliant writer

 While he unveils his story in language as simple and clear as an article in the National Geographic, he explores the territory of the Taureg people, their world where men cover their faces and women do not, and, the very stability of their harvest of salt in an era of the internet and cell phones

 Gifted in languages, he speaks French fluently and is well versed in Arabic


 Unfortunately, although the trekking company promised him a guide fluent in French, he finds that he must rely on Walid who speaks no French and his Arabic is more Taureg than conversational Egyptian
 Like a mountaineer who discovers that his map of the route is incomplete but is is the only one he has, Benanev finds that he must take Walid as his compass, even if -- and they do -- get lost.Benanev also does a wonderful job of describing the salt trade and how its economy sustains the people and culture of Mali
 Seemlessly, he weaves into his story his observations on the impact of globalism -- especially road building


 However, rather than presenting a sermon, he leaves the reader with useful questions to ask, many of which may challenge basic assumptions.And yet, no matter how intellectually speculative Benanev becomes, he is ever ready to return to reality

 Be it the saddle sores on his butt or the joy of finding a thorn tree in the empty space, our writer is always aware of the frailties of his own body -- and hilariously, his own ego

 A master linguist, he finds himself again and again in situations where he has thought he has everything figured out, only to find that that he has said, while completely understood, was completely rejected and the only one who didn't get it was he.For the sake of credibility, I wish I could find a way to criticize this book but I cannot
 Men of Salt is simply the best book I have read in a year and his capacity for story telling and reflection is totally on a par with Joe Simpson's "Touching the Void."  Benanev's book will touch anyone who loves history, adventure, economics, or the uncharted areas of the heart


 He may have started out as a stranger in a strange land, but when you join him in his return to Timbuktu, you, too, feel as if you've come home.Roseanne Freese

$REVIEW.: this is a very good book from a man who did five years with the NYPD then became a Secret Service agent for 12 years protecting Pres. Bush and Obama. He left the service to run for Senator In Maryland as a Republican eventually losing. You gain an insight into what drove him to become a Secret Serviceman, the detail and preparation involved in elaborate security plans and why he eventually left and ran for office. Bongino states on pg. 106, &#34;It seem to me that the Obama White House staff lived in a utopian bubble devoid of any acknowledgement of  real world consequences.&#34; Thus the title, though he would risk his life as his job requires for the President, he disagrees with him on many issues. The end of the book contains chapters on his run for office, &#34;fast and furious&#34;, the Boston Marathon bombing and the Benghazi attack. The author claims that the Obama administration has an obvious discomfort with publicly acknowledging that  terrorism is a by-product of the President's ideological belief system and that the historical mistakes of the US are the cause of our current global challenges. In a misguided effort to not cast blame, the American people are being exposed to uneccesary dangers of terrorism both domestic and internationally. This is an informative, interesting book by an inspiring individual.

$review_text.: **I received this book from the author, via Goodreads, in exchange for an honest review**First, let me say that I really enjoyed reading this story
I think that mental illness, in general is often misdiagnosed and misunderstood

I liked the way the author used Sabrina's so-called mental illness to convey her story

The story is believable enough that I could see someone being misdiagnosed as mentally ill vs
having precognitive dreams, b/c society in general is willing to accept that a person is crazy, but NOT that the human mind has the ability to do things we may not always understand.I would have liked to have known a little more about Devon, such as what previous waking event would have made Sabrina so willing to believe that he was evil


I also felt like I was missing something with the backstory of her life
I just couldn't put my finger on it.I also think that the instant willingness to share so much with Riley, so fast, was not as believable, considering that she was so private with everyone else

I loved how the author took the effort to describe the characters in such a way that I got a good picture of them in my mind.I am really hoping that this story continues with another book, because I am curious to see how these characters develop
I am also very curious about whether Devon is truly evil, and haunting Sabrina


Overall, this was a fun, easy read, and I felt that it would be appropriate for an older teen.

Will Anders put his garage on the line just for a shot at the woman he's sure is out of his league? And as the temperature cranks up, will they both be able to keep their nerve?I loved this book. I really loved Anders. He was a hot guy but a sweet guy too. He does such endearing things to prove to Kate that he is worthy but continues to be who he is. He is willing to go the distance for her. I could see Kate's dilemma. She had so much to lose to be with Anders but there is something there? I just felt that the chemistry between Kate and Anders was amazing and the story was just sweet. There is some hot sex but some hotter love there because Kate needs Anders in ways she might not realize.

$REVIEW.: Once again, Dante's Hell literary masterpiece is being distorted, mainly by forcing this classical to the present time.  I don't understand how it is possible that some writers do not understand the meaning of "classical".  Well, just in case, it means "timeless".  Having said that, forcing a classical story to the present time is simply an insult to the reader.  In other words, the author is telling us that we cannot feel or understand that what was written hundreds of years ago cannot be interpreted in present time.  Very disappointed!

In Takedown, we meet Wyatt and Rye - which is a male/male erotic romance

In Somewhere in Between, Wyatt and Rye meet a woman named Darby who they instantly feel a connection with
This book contains both a male/male love scene and a threesome.These books aren't for everyone


I know that a lot of people are squirmish when it comes to M/M love scenes, but Stacey Kennedy makes it HOTTT


There's more to it than just sex, the characters have a connection that takes it to another level


There is also an interesting story involved


Wyatt is a U.S
Marshall who is trying to catch a killer
Darby is a victim that Wyatt feels compelled to protect.The story is sweet, sexy, and suspenseful

This novella is a quick read - you can easily finish it in one setting which makes is really convenient
Stacey Kennedy writes a great story


If you are on the fence about trying books like this, I suggest you try this one - I bet you'll like it!

$REVIEW.: I don&#8217;t think I need to write a synopsis about this book, the title pretty much covers it. Thin Wire is the story of a young woman&#8217;s heroine addiction, and her mother&#8217;s struggle to somehow save her daughter.Although I love reading memoirs, I find that I have a hard time reviewing them. Unless it&#8217;s truly terribly written, it&#8217;s very difficult to put forth an opinion on the book without feeling as though you are passing judgement on the actions of author of the book&#8230;something I do not like doing. It would be one thing if this book was a work of fiction, then I probably would not think twice about reaming out Christine&#8217;s character, her idea of dealing with her daughter&#8217;s increasing dependence to heroine. I almost did not finish this because I was just so frustrated by her.But it was a memoir and I felt as though I couldn&#8217;t do these things. I just had to swallow back any critisisims I felt and wait to see how the rest of the book played out and instead focus my attention on the mechanics of the book&#8230;how was it written? To my memory it was an okay written book. At times the story shifted between Christine&#8217;s viewpoint and her daughter&#8217;s and it wasn&#8217;t always clear when that happened&#8230;so that was annoying, and why I dropped the rating to 3 stars but other than that, I seem to remember it was decent. Not overly exciting. Not something I&#8217;d recommend, but for the price (a Kindle freebie) decent enough.

$review_text.: And most of the "slow cooker/crockpot" books recycle the same old recipes, updated occasionally, that were invented in the '70s when the slow cooker burst onto the scene.  This author manages to pull out a few interesting recipes worthy of experimenting with.  I do think the book needs an editing pass, but it's not horrible.  The problem would come in where someone who is new in the kitchen could make a mistake and not realize it.  For example, the recipe I did try (Carribean Shredded Pork) calls for one 3-4 pound chicken, but no pork!S'cool, though, because I was using chicken anyway since I am an experienced cook and know how to make substitutions, but someone new to cooking would have had some issues.  Just so you know, I did do some minor tweaking to the recipe, but the sauce for the Carribean Shredded Pork (which I am actually using again today with some pork ribs in the crockpot) was excellent.There are several other recipes that I will be giving a whirl: Chicken & Dumplings, Scalloped Potatoes and Mulled Wine Cider (looks excellent!)Thanks, author, for the Kindle freebie.

The writing is excellent for the most part but really needs a lot of editing too.  It could be shorter - there are repetitions that should be cut and that stifle the flow. There are also typos & misuse of words that a copy editor would catch (quaff for coif, as an example.)  It's too bad because the story was well developed, characters were pretty believable, settings nicely described.  I'll read more in the series but I really hope the author gets more help from his publisher.
$SUMMARY.: Falls needs help getting up.

$REVIEW.: Even though I found the plot predictable, I loved the comedy moments with Lizard, which had me laughing out loud. I wondered why the writer totally forgot about the crooked cop who was helping the hit man and that there was never anything in the ending of the book about whether or not he got caught and punished, but overall a book that I would definitely recommend.

$REVIEW.: I wasn't necessarily disappointed in the designs, as they are different and modern and show what can be done with polymer clay
Some are quite simple, however..


disks with a single bead between them to make a necklace, round beads with bits of chain between them.Like another reviewer, I was disappointed in the layout of the book (all the color pictures up front with all the directions in the back, leaving you to flip back and forth, back and forth, to get the gist of what the artist is saying with each step)..


that and the fact that the directions were often sketchy


 Maybe not for someone who's a polymer clay artist and does it every day, but certainly for those people who have not done a certain technique before

 A lot of books have the step-by-step photos to show what's being done and how it looks "along the way." This has a few pen sketches for each but no photos.The directions specifically for the black half-circles adhering to a chain..


interesting looking!  But it says to use Sculpey Bake & Bond, and according to what I've seen in all the ads/descriptions for Bake & Bond, it's for clay-to-clay or clay-to-POROUS-materials, not clay to a metal chain


 I would hate to think I took the time to make it and sell it, only to hear that the circles fell off 3 months later
 There are several other designs in the book using Bake & Bond to adhere clay to chain or wire.I will try some of these designs and figure out the directions, but overall I was disappointed


 Sorry!

$REVIEW.: Twenty tales of science fiction with all having a central theme of war and space.Of the stories, I gave four of them 5 stars. Sadly, I gave three of them 1 star, something I had never done before. The average rating ending up at 3.05 stars. So why only the two star rating?I picked up this book at my local bookstore based on the cover and blurb. My expectation was to find 20 short stories centered around war and space. Unfortunately, there were too many stories where war got passing mention at best and sometimes so did space. With eight of the stories rating only 2 stars or less, it's just too high a percentage to give the book a rating of 3 stars.If you chance on a copy, the gem of the bunch, in my opinion, is The Long Chase by Geoffrey A. Landis&#34;Who's Afraid of Wolf 359? by Ken MacLeod. For the opening story of a collection of 20 sci-fi shorts, the editors could have picked a better one to start with. This tale is downright silly, from the inane descriptions of things to the absolute ignorance of the protagonist. He doesn't even know what a planet looks like. It was an embarrassing read. 1 star&#34;&#34;Surf by Suzanne Palmer. Wow, I felt a surge of relief after the horrible first story to encounter this thoroughly enjoyable one. Intelligent, and detailed, this is a well played story with enough unanswered questions leaving you pining for more. 5 stars&#34;&#34;Another Life by Charles Oberndorf. Somewhere in the background, there is a war going on but this story has very little to do with the war. I found the story dragged and wasted too much on boring sexual exploits. 2 stars&#34;&#34;Between Two Dragons by Yoon Ha Lee. The Asian background to the story gave it some character but the tale being told by someone who you never discover who she is distracts from the story. 3 stars&#34;&#34;Scales by Alastair Reynolds. Short, and laced with lots of big words, this flash through the different stages of one man's continuing adaptation to fight a war is fun, though somewhat predictable. 4 stars&#34;&#34;Golubash, Or Wine-Blood-War-Elegy by Catherynne M. Valente. The sale of contraband wine during wartime in space is the setting and done with flair. An enjoyable piece. 5 stars&#34;&#34;Leave by Robert Reed. This story left a few things unclear, but the way it was told was mesmerizing. 5 stars&#34;&#34;Mehra And Jiun by Sandra McDonald. Same tired territory where a human is held prisoner by an alien and they become friends. Although the tale is okay, this format has been done too many times. 3 stars&#34;&#34;Her Husband's Hands by Adam-Troy Castro. Prior to this collection of sci-fi shorts, I had never given one star. Now I am at two. This is the most inane, silly, story I have ever read. I kept hoping something intelligent would come out of it, but that never happened. 1 star&#34;&#34;Remembrance by Beth Bernobich. This is not the first story in the collection to be themed on sex, not sci-fi and definitely not War & Space. Too often I find sci-fi writers using the genre to play out their sexual fantasies. 2 stars&#34;&#34;Palace Resolution by Tom Purdom. An interesting debate over political style. I enjoyed how it focused on subtleties. 4 stars&#34;&#34;The Observer by Kristine Kathryn Rusch. Standard juiced future soldier stuff. Not much to it. 2 stars&#34;&#34;The Long Chase by Geoffrey A. Landis. An intelligent piece set around two machines engaged in a chase across the cosmos. The internal debate of the protagonist is enjoyable. 5 stars&#34;&#34;Art Of War by Nancy Kress. The concept was unique, I'll give it that. The delivery of it left some to be desired. 3 stars&#34;&#34;Have You Any Wool by Alan DeNiro. I read through this twice. A very difficult read and even more so to follow. I think I understand what the author was trying to do, but it came across as way too convoluted. 1 star&#34;&#34;Carthago Delenda Est by Genevieve Valentine. This short had a difficult start. It was hard to sort through the first couple of pages and I had to read them twice. I hate that. Clones in space waiting for something. That's it. 2 stars&#34;&#34;Rats Of The System by Paul McAuley. Intelligent robots, fanatical creatures and humans populate this story about a desperate attempt as solving the robots. 4 stars&#34;&#34;The Political Officer by Charles Coleman Finlay. More of a novelette than a short story at 56 pages. This tale of subterfuge and competing government departments reads like a spy novel. Considering its length, I was hoping not to have any unanswered questions at the end, but that was not to be. 4 stars&#34;&#34;Amid The Words Of War by Cat Rambo. Aliens ants, or something like them, at war with humans. The start was hard to follow. 3 stars&#34;&#34;A soldier Of The City by David Moles. The tale tries to follow a solitary soldier caught in a space war. It is written in a disjointed way that made it difficult to follow. 2 stars&#34;

$review_text.: I thought this book was not only a great read but shows a great evolving author.  While I have loved all the books in this series (and this was my intro to the whole genre) this one is great for the double story line.  Mystery, intrigue, action, and steamy scenes in two locations with the three couples (not all together) made the book fast paced.I love how the different characters point of view seem to move the story along without missing or duplicating anything.The reveal and development of the characters was also well done!  Some review said they were surprised by Rafe.  I was not surprised at all by Rafe.  Strong women like Dria would not have some quiet push-over.  This shows the true equality that should exist between couples, no matter what the appearance.  She has always shown a unique balance and interconnection between Dria, Rafe, and Jonathan.  And quiet frankly who doesn't want a Rafe or Jonathan!I laughed, I held my breathe, I blushed some, and I cried (happy/sappy tears).  With new characters and possible unfinished business I can't wait for the next book!  Glad to have learned there were going to be more in this series!

$REVIEW.: This is a case of not judging a book by it's cover (or it's title). This book has excellent information about foods that are not only good for one's skin, but for the entire body. There's an entire chapter about inflammation, and one on acne and psoriasis.And yes, there is a chapter on "foods that fight wrinkles." Who would have thought brussel sprouts would be one of them?This is not another quick fix book. It's a fairly solid reference on the nutritional values of many different foods and what benefits they have on the body.This book is a better investment than any number of supposedly miracle creams. It's a pleasure to browse through. I highly recommend it.I hesitated giving it five stars, for I felt the recipes felt like an afterthought. I doubt I'll be using any of them, but in the end, it doesn't matter. This was obviously not meant to be a cookbook.

$REVIEW.: **This is the second book in the series. If you haven't read the first, The Journey; you may not want to read this review**According to Good Reads:Seek a fresh start with Amish widower Samuel Fisher as he journeys from Lancaster County to Bluegrass Country, hoping to find a balm for the grief he's carried with him. Will this single father, burdened by yesterday's memories, discover a new and perhaps better life in Kentucky, the land of tomorrow? Esther Beiler, who helps watch Samuel's children, develops a crush on Samuel and a true affection for his kids. Can she win his heart, or has she already lost it to an English woman? How will God untangle star-crossed lovers when jealousies and misconceptions threaten to tear them apart?I think everyone at one point or another can relate to the grief and sorrow that Samuel is going through. His wife dies along with their unborn child. Any mans worst nightmare. After this tragedy, he is engulfed in grief and depression. I will admit, I was a little confused. I didn't realize that this was the second book in a series; if I had I would have read the first one beforehand. However, even though I was slightly confused with some of the characters and the Kentucky/Pennsylvania story lines, I felt this was still a great book. This book takes you on a journey through the grief of losing someone you hold dear to your heart, but with the gracious help of God; the chance to heal all their pain in the hopes of finding love again.I rate this book 4/5

$review_text.: This book is a good enjoyable read, entertainment rather than a serious exploration of conspiracy theories. Its mostly sensible and factual perspective gives a credible general guide to those unfamiliar with some of the theories written about.The hand-scribbled comments in red ink in the margins on every page from a fictional conspiracy-obsessed reader are often funny and poignant, a fine original idea which works surprisingly well in counterbalancing and highlighting likely reactions to the main text.Some other reviewers have commented that too much credence is given by the author to the more preposterous and insane theories - like the "9/11-attacks-were-an-inside-job" cult, promoted by a small motley crew of obsessives and charlatans but primarily for which no evidence exists (for a grounded perspective, look up what Noam Chomsky says on the subject).However, this is surely to miss the point. Monte Cook has not researched these "conspiracies" in great depth, and does not seek to explore all the details of the claims. It's a "Skeptic's Guide" - i.e. a book designed primarily to entertain, aimed at the casually interested reader who has neither time nor inclination to obsess through internet conspiracy sites and devour a large number of conspiracy books. People who have more grounded and productive lives might appreciate an easy-read guide to a very 20th/21st century phenomenon which has exploded in the internet age, and it is for this audience that the book is written.The check-list at the end of each chapter is an interesting and bold idea, which partially succeeds. However the informed reader will see that the author has not really done in-depth homework on all the issues: as an example, at the end of the chapter on alien abductions (not a conspiracy per se but the intentional covering-up of the program and ridiculing of witnesses may well be) none of the works of Hopkins, Mack, Jacobs, Fowler or any of the esteemed and respected mainstream researchers is referenced at all. This might just be an oversight, or the author's very slight aquaintance with the subject and ignorance of the sheer quantity of data. However to the author's credit, he does acknowledge something is going on and gives the likelihood of abductions being true a 6/10.So in summary, if you're looking for a serious tract examining the origins and propagation of conspiracy theories to the gullible, then look elsewhere. If you accept this book as entertainment, broadly on track and a good humorous read, with some useful information for the largely uninformed reader, you won't be disappointed.

$review_text.: QUICK REVIEW:Once again Peterson hits the ball out of the park and gives us a book that really delivers

 When done properly, isometric exercises really do enhance muscle development


 But, at least for me, these are ADVANCED exercises that I was only able to do effectively once I achieved better muscle awareness and control

 This is a five star book, but I think it works best for folks who have already mastered the basics of Petersons' Transformetrics system or similar methods of exercise
Before buying this book you may want to buy (or at least take a look at) two of Peterson's other booksThe Miracle Seven: 7 Amazing Exercises That Slim, Sculpt, and Build the Body in 20 Minutes a DayandPushing Yourself to Power: The Ultimate Guide to Total Body Transformation


As with his other books, Peterson is short on prescriptions for fitness


 He gives you the information as to how to make isometric exercise part of your fitness program, but doesn't give you an exact routine to follow.(NOTE:  I recommend the spiral bound version of this book (and the other Transformetrics books) when available
 It helps when you want to look at an individual picture and do the exercise
 It avoids placing weights on the book and cracking a standard binding...)THE LONGWINDED REVIEW:I started using Peterson's Transformetrics system a year and half ago

 I started by purchasing the Miracle Seven (M7) and then, heartened by success, bought Pushing Yourself to Power (PYTP) shortly thereafter
 Peterson has brought back these old methods of exercise, written books that clearly illustrate the techniques, and opened up a new level of fitness to his readers.You'd think that after such success with M7 and PYTP I'd simply trust Peterson and would have bought the Isometric Power Revolution earlier

 But this was not the case
 In spite of my past successes with Peterson's method, I was a major skeptic about this book.THE STRUCTURE OF THE BOOK:1

GOALS:  Peterson starts off, like any good executive, with goals in mind

 This is a sound way to begin, because it really puts one's exercise program into context


 After goals he explains deep breathing, which as it turns out is incredibly important for isometrics.2

HISTORY:  We get a concise history of isometrics

 This may seem odd, at first, for an exercise book, but is a welcome addition given the fact that isometrics have often been maligned as ineffective and are generally not well understood


 He introduces us to some of the pioneers and heroes of isometrics and also puts and puts isometrics into a historical context
 The section was a quick and interesting read and really gets you revved up for the exercises


 Some have commented on lack of references, but this is not a scholarly text


 Anyhow, with web search engines on hand you could verify Peterson's facts quite easily


 You can also find the pioneering articles on isometrics in a health sciences library
 Fact checkers beware, Peterson does his homework, but in many cases there may be conflicting evidence.3

NUTRITION:  This is a minimalist overview of Peterson's philosophy on nutrition and could have been fleshed out


 Pushing Yourself To Power and the Miricle Seven have a more in depth nutritional regimen
 I believe he kept things simple here because he described this in more depth in his other books.4


ISOMETRICS QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:  This is a nice little FAQ section
 Peterson answers commonly asked questions about isometrics


 He easily anticipates a reader's queries and gives precise and satisfying answers

 I suppose this reveals Peterson's experience in championing a neglected kind of exercise


 He knows what a skeptic or student might ask and is able to provide solid answers.5


BLOOD PRESSURE AND ISOS:  He discusses how to perform isometrics safely

 If done correctly, they do not increase blood pressure

 (Yes

 I have a cuff and checked before and after.)  He has even outlined steps to use isos to lower your blood pressure
 (Not tried, but his references to Broino Kiveloff and how to lower blood pressure using isometrics are also spot on
 You can find Dr


Kiveloff's article in J Am Geriatr Soc


1971 Dec;19(12):1006-12

 It's there.)6


THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN:  This is the only part of the book with isotonic exercises
 These are seven exercises that can use in low reps to warm up or at higher reps as part of your exercise routine
 This section also includes the Tiger Bend (`Hindu' or `Furey') push up and the Hindu squat that  Peterson believes are the best odds calisthenics that you can perform
 At first, I wasn't sure why Peterson put these in
 They seem like fish out of water in an isometrics book

 However, they do give you a reasonable warm up and loosen your muscles and joints at low reps


 They are a good preparation for the isometric exercises that follow.7

CLASSIC ISOMETRIC EXERCISES (see below)8

ISOMETRIC POWER FLEX EXERCISES (see below)THE TRANSFORMTETRICS SYSTEM:The Isometric Power Revolution concentrates on Isometrics, a single component of Peterson's Transformetrics system


 Let me explain


 The transformetrics system is basically composed of four kinds of exercises:1
DSR: Dynamic Self Resistance where one limb acts in resistance to the other throughout a specified range of motion


For example, flexing the right biceps and using the left hand grab your right fist
Now extend and flex providing resistance by opposing the motion of your right arm with your left hand.2
DVR: Dynamic Visualized Resistance where the muscles are tensed maximally and then moved through a specified range of motion
 For example,  by `making  a muscle' by flexing at the biceps


Keep the tension high as you flex and extend the arm.3


PC: Power Calisthenics which are Peterson's best-bet variations of push ups, sit ups, squats, kicks, chin ups, pull ups etc.4

Isometric exercises that involve static contraction of muscles by resisting one limb against the other maximally without movement, flexing at the extremes of contraction without movement, or maintaining a posture without movement


 (More on these later.)1-3 are ISOTONIC exercises
 That is, the muscles expand and contract while moving against some form of resistance (gravity, tension supplied by an opposing limb, or their own intrinsic tension)


 Isometrics are quite different--here the muscle pushes against resistance but doesn't move.At the outset, I was most comfortable with the power calisthenics and the DSR exercises


 Once I achieved more muscle control, the DVR exercises started to make more sense to me and I added more of them into my routine

 But the isometric exercises never really quite clicked


 I basically resolved to skip over these exercises and concentrated on what worked best for me.This worked quite well with M7 and PYTP
 The majority of exercises therein were DSR, DVR, and PC


 Isometrics were thrown into the mix, but were fewer and farther between


 Once again, I didn't really `get it.'  I couldn't seem to make these work
 This was somewhat ironic, as Peterson--who never seems to hold back his enthusiasm for any Transformetric exercise--seemed to praise the isometric exercises above and beyond the rest


I just didn't get it


 What was I missing?  I should have taken a clue from Peterson's Grandfather who told Peterson at age 10 that he needed to learn how all of his muscles work and move before he started pushing them to the limit

 Peterson's Uncle Milo promised to teach isometrics to the young John Peterson when he turned 18, after his DSRs,DVRs, and PCs up to snuff


(The story appears on page 19 and 20 of the Miracle Seven.)ISOMETRICS:As it turns out, Grandpa and Uncle Milo were right


 At least for me, the isometrics require more muscle awareness and concentration to be effective
 This would not be the first book in the Transformetric series that I would pick up if I were nave to this kind of exercise
 But once you develop this level of mastery, isometrics can really take you to the next level
 You can think of them as the 'power lifting' equivalent in Transformetrics.Peterson breaks up isometrics into three types:1
Classic Isometric Contraction (CIC):  These isometric exercises require that you contract your muscle powerfully in a single position by pitting muscle against muscle or pushing against a fixed object (e.g


a table or wall)
 Most exercises in this class are like a frozen DSR

 For example, you attempt to do a biceps curl with your right hand while providing resistance against the curl with your left


 However, unlike a DSR you try to contract maximally with each hand, but the forces are equally balanced so you stay in the same position


 There is no movement

 Other examples would be pushing against a fixed object like a table, chair, or wall


 Muscles are maximally pushing, but there is no movement

 (These are similar, but in practice they are two separate subcategories
 When pitting muscle against muscle, you are defacto exercising opposing muscle groups


 When you push or pull a fixed object you are exercising (flexing or extending) with one set of muscles


 Peterson is now selling an 'Isometric Power Belt' on his website
 The advantage to such a device is that you can isolate the isometrics to a single group of flexing or extending muscle


 On the other hand, Peterson believes that although the device may facilitate exercising some muscle groups, it is not necessary.)2

Peak Contraction Isomtric Powerflex (PCIP):  This is more like a frozen DVR


 Muscles are maximally contracted while you maintain a posture

 This would be like flexing at your biceps with maximal power but without movement.3

Static Isometric Postures (SIP):  In this kind of exercise, you maintain a posture--like the beginning position of a push up--and simply do not move
 These are not unlike maintaining various postures in Yoga


 Isometric postures are ususally easy at first but become more difficult as you maintain the posture over time

There are very few of these exercises in this book that could be classified as SIPs.Most exercises fit within a single category, but some are combinations of categories.CLASSIC ISOMETRIC CONTRACTIONS (CICs):These are the most accessible for me at this point


 Each exercise is accompanied with explanations and pictures


 Peterson and two of his students model the exercises effectively and the photographs clearly show you what positions you have to assume

 The technique of contracting to the maximum while inhaling and then to maintain the contraction for a count of seven while exhaling is effective.One of the criticisms of isometric contraction is that it only strengthens the muscle in a single position
 To counter this, Peterson has you repeat the exercise in three or more positions throughout a range of motion.The descriptions of the exercises are precise and they are critical here
 At first blush, many of the pictures look quite similar, if not the same

 Upon reading the descriptions, however, you may be instructed to pull or push in a different direction

 Until you actually start to do the exercises, you might wonder whether the pictures were even necessary
 Let's face it, with isometric contraction there is no movement

 You are simply looking at Peterson or one of the other models holding a position


 However, once you start to do the exercises the pictures really do help clarify what needs to be done


 The book would be far less engaging and effective without the pictures.Peterson does state that virtually any exercise could be converted into an isometric exercise, but clearly some positions are better suited than others

 Peterson's has real expertise in giving you the best bet bet isometric exercises that allow for maximal opposition of forces without awkward positioning

Even so, there are some exercises that are more challenging to do than others

 I have found that the CIC exercises for the larger muscles in the upper body have been easier to master than those for the lower body, torso, wrist, and hand

 These are, of course, doable but it takes a while to figure out how to achieve and maintain maximal tension


 This is one of the advantages of the exercise band that Peterson sells

 (I didn't buy Peterson's device, but used aLifeline Jungle Gymthat I bought a long while ago for body weight exercises, such as chin ups and pull ups

 This is basically webbing with two connected handles

 You can step on the webbing and pull on the handles in various positions to perform an isometric contraction.)  It was much easier for me to use a simple apparatus to isolate the hand muscles or provide fixed resistance for the larger leg muscles
Perseverance pays off over time and I have improved in leg work, wrist work, and hand work over time


 Still, these exercises are more challenging to do isometrically and I prefer to use isotonic (PCs, DVRs, DSRs etc.) to exercise these muscles.It should be noted, that most of the exercises in this section are CICs


 Some of the exercises within the CIC section might be technically classified as isometric power flexes or are difficult to classify hybrids of CICs, IPFs, and IPs


 This makes sense because Peterson wants to provide a full body work out and some muscle groups (for example, abdominal muscles) are not so amenable to typical CIC exercise.ISOMETRIC POWER FLEXES:These poses are very similar to what body builders do at shows to show off their muscles

 The prose isn't clear as to whether these kinds of exercises simply improve muscle definition or improve strength

 My take on his writing is that Peterson believes that when these exercises are combined with the correct breathing techniques they are as effective as the classic isometric contractions.I have to admit that these have been more challenging for me
 Flexing one's muscles maximally against their own resistance is more difficult than flexing muscle against muscle

 It takes a great deal more control to isolate muscle groups this way and, hence, more concentration to get the best results


However, once you get the hang of them, these exercises are quite rewarding in their own right
 Peterson demonstrates how to do these exercises so that you can exercise all muscle groups.Once again, the pictures and descriptions are extremely helpful in demonstrating the exercises


 This level of explanation really makes the book stand out
For me, these exercises are still a work in progress, but I am coming along with them and they seem to be additive to the CICs.CONTROVERSIES AND CONUNDRUMS:DO ISOMETRICS WORK?I can't speak for everybody, but adding these exercises into my routine have improved my overall muscle hypertrophy and strength

 I have gained more definition of the muscle groups and am able to perform more consecutive push ups and pull ups than I was able to before I added these exercises into my routine.That being said, Peterson addresses some important issues of isometrics in his Q&A; section


 Isometrics are a component of an exercise program, they are not the whole ball of wax


 Peterson breaks down fitness into seven attributes--Strength, Flexibility, Endurance, Speed, Balance, Coordination, and Aesthetics


 Although isometrics build strength and aesthetics, they require a different kind of coordination and balance than do weight lifting exercises.When lifting weights or doing any specialized sports-related move, you need a specific combination of strength, balance, and coordination

 Isometrics will help build strength, and using Petersons technique can even do so throughout a range of motion


However, they cannot help you develop the balance and coordination required for another activity.For example, Isometrics can strengthen your arms, back, and core muscles but cannot give you the balance and coordination to do a pull up
 Nor might the isometric exercise strengthen all of your muscles in the balanced way required to do a pull up


 That being said, isometrics may augment your strength and contribute to your ability to do a pull up


 However, you will still have to do pull ups in order to get good at doing pull ups.The same can be said for lifting weights

 You may be able to lift massive amounts by doing a biceps curl, but these will not give you the muscle coordination or balance to, say, throw a caber (or for that matter do an isometric exercise effectively)

 Overall improvements in strength do not always translate to gains in every area

 They will likely contribute, but can't substitute for all activities.Peterson recommends using isometrics in conjunction with other kinds of isotonic exercises and sports training.WHERE'S THE ROUTINE?Peterson gives you all the information you need on how to integrate these exercises into your existing routine, but doesn't prescribe the exact regimen

 This is consistent throughout his books, as he doesn't believe in a one-size-fits-all kind of program
 I admire this approach, but for the beginner it would still be helpful if he suggested a sequence for a beginner, intermediate, and advanced exerciser


 Even so, once you get the feel for the exercises, it becomes easier to see how to do this for yourself

 You can also seek advice on his website.IS IT SOMETHING FOR NOTHING?No


 Peterson promises results, but only if you work and work really hard at this

 None of these exercises will work unless you put forth large amounts of effort and concentration
 Isometrics may be efficient in terms of the time it takes to do an exercise, but they will (and should) take incredible amounts of effort


 These exercises are simple to learn but difficult to master.DOES THIS BOOK ADD ANYTHING TO 'PUSHING YOURSELF TO POWER'Absolutely
 The Miracle Seven is an excellent introduction to Peterson's Transformetrics system


 Pushing Yourself To Power (PYTP) is the best general book about this kind of exercise and is almost encyclopedic

 PYTP does explain isometrics, but concentrates mostly on DVR, DSR, and PC exercises
 In the Isometric Power Revolution (IPR), Peterson really takes the time to explain the history, principles, and practical use of isometrics

 PYTP is more concerned about a holistic, Transformetrics approach to exercising a muscle group or region, showing DVR, DSR, PC, and isometric exercises for that isolate that area
 IPR also goes through all major muscle groups, but shows you how to exercise these areas using isometrics alone


 This allows him to go into far more detail and demonstrate far more isometric exercises.POTENTIAL FOR INJURYAs compared with free weights, the potential for injury is probably lower for isometrics

 Peterson always sends the message that you must listen to your body and stop when you feel pain


 (He does not believe in 'no pain, no gain.')  That being said, you can certainly over-strain your muscles with this or any other exercise
 Anyone who has ever tried to push an immovable object with all of his or her might knows that the next day can be one of muscle pains and strains

 You can overdo the isometrics and cause muscle strain
 Then again, the potential to do this is low if you listen to your body.THE EMPHASIS ON DEEP BREATHINGPeterson probably states this better in his book than I can, but in a nutshell it is impossible to do isometric exercises maximally, efficiently, and safely without the proper breathing technique
 It is almost useless to jump to the exercises without making a concerted effort in learning proper breathing technique
 Without this you will be sorely disappointed in using isometrics as a system, as your results will be poor


 It is no mistake that Peterson repeats breathing technique with every description of exercises in the book.BLOOD PRESSURE PROBLEMSBefore reading the book, I too thought that isometric work might increase my blood pressure

Having a blood pressure cuff handy, I tested my blood pressure before and after exercising this way
 I am only a single person and results may vary, but my blood pressure was the same or lower after performing isometrics correctly

 Peterson also has a prescription to lower bood pressure
 Peterson also recommends many of the same things your doctor would recommend to lower your pressure (for example, salt restriction) and adds in isometrics contractions
 His reference to Broino Kiveloff and how to lower blood pressure using isometrics can be found in the J Am Geriatr Soc
1971 Dec;19(12):1006-12

 It may be worth a try.THERE IS NOTHING NEW IN THIS BOOKInterestingly, some reviews have looked at this as the 'same old isometric stuff.'  Well, IT IS, but I don't think that that is a criticism


 Peterson has simply researched and packaged it so that it is easily accessible and incredibly usable.There is nothing in this book that you cannot get from other sources


 Peterson himself even tells you about his sources in the history section


 As with PYTP, you could find all these sources and put them together yourself and come up with your own version of this book

 You can even go to Peterson's website and look at the 'classics' section or go to the 'Eugene Sandow and the Golden Age of Iron Men' website and look at more exercise literature from a bygone era
 Yes, all this stuff can be found (somewhere) on the web and you don't have to pay for it

 Furthermore, you could create your own isometric program--virtually any move can be turned into an isometric exercise.But when you surf the web and look at that literature, you will realize that it is often poorly organized, poorly photographed, or poorly explained


 You will not find a more thorough going over of the material than you find here or another source that is so clearly photographed and explained


 The reason to buy the book is because it is well written, well photographed, and well organized


You are also buying it because of Peterson's expertise--he points you to the exercises and gives you the techniques that work the best
It is also well priced, given its size and the excellent photographs and descriptions.ANTI-FREE WEIGHT BIASPeterson is unabashed about this and is against using weights


 You are free to agree or disagree with him on this account, but it doesn't take away from the exercises presented here


 As someone who used to lift and now almost exclusively uses Transformetrics, I can say that Peterson has won me over


 On the other hand, there is no reason to assume that one kind of exercise is for everyone

 I know plenty of people who have lifted for quite some time and have never had 'busted up weight lifters syndrome.'  Then again, none of these weight lifters were power lifters and they were more interested in lean muscle, using lower weights for higher repetitions

 I do think Peterson is quite correct if you think about the lifters you know who are lifting heavier weights

 I can't really think of any lifters I know who have tried to push it to the max who didn't have shoulder or back problems at some point in time.What I will say is that I am impressed as to what I have been able to accomplish after using Peterson's system--not just isometrics but the whole Transformetrics system

 When I started I used the Trasnformetrics along with weights and exercise bands, I was impressed with how much Transformetrics added


 Over time I have stopped lifting weights and have less joint pain, no strains, and have seen great progress


 I have tested myself by occasionally to see how much I can lift (Peterson is not against testing yourself on occasion) and have seen much improvement over time
 It's hard to believe that you can accomplish this without lifting weights, but it is possible

 All this with zero pain--amazing


 By the same token, it may be that isometrics aren't the exercise for you


 But once again, you need to decide what works.WHY NO APPARATUS BASED ISOMETRICS?You could try to argue that Peterson is against using all but the most basic of equipment, but he now sells the 'Isometric Power Belt' on his website

 This is basically a thick ribbon of Kevlar reinforced webbing with a friction buckle that can be used for isometric exercises and comes with a manual.I haven't used this device, but it seems to to replicate exercises as advocated by Alexander Zass and others who used to perform such exercises using chains(see the Sandow and the Golden Age of Iron Men site)
 I did try some rudimentary exercises, as noted above, with myLifeline Jungle Gymwhich basically consists of two adjustable handles connected to webbing
 This is 'off label' use of the Jungle Gym--it isn't designed for this kind of exercise--but it served the purpose
 As above, it was easier to exert maximal effort in one direction than it is to learn how to oppose muscle groups or do a power flex

 At least at this juncture, I don't think I will buy the device, but if I decide to use an apparatus, it seems pretty clear that a simple design like the Peterson's Power Belt would be the way to go.The Isometric Power Revolution is complete in the sense that it gives you a range of classic and power flex isometric exercises for all major muscle groups
 However, it does not address how to implement isometrics using apparatus (other than a hand towel, wall, table, or chair)

 For completeness' sake, Peterson could have included these
 He may not have wanted to 'force' his readers to buy a piece of equipment in order to fully use the book or may have felt it more practical from a marketing standpoint to sell these separately

 Either way, it was nice that I was not obligated to buy a piece of equipment along with the book unless I really wanted to.MUSCLE TIGHTNESS AND STRETCHINGThere is no specific part of the book that is devoted to stretching


 This book is all about maximal muscle contraction


 Even with the relaxation phase and deep breathing, I have to stretch after exercising.Peterson is incredibly flexible and can contort himself into a variety of positions


 He may be able to do this without a formal stretching program because he has superior muscle control and can maximally relax as easily as he can maximally contract
 However, I am not yet there and have incorporated my own stretching routine to prevent muscle stiffness.***NOTE:  I read on the forum that stretching per se is not necessary after Transformtric type exercising

 What you perceive as tightness is apparently a natural result of the exercise

 Unlike weights where you often overburden the muscles at some point in the range of motion, Transormetric type exercises don't do this
 I have to say, I still enjoy stretching after this kind of exercise


 However, eliminating the stretches deliberately for over a week wasn't harmful and didn't cause me any ill effects
 Peterson was once again quite correct that the feeling of tightness dissipates with time and relaxation and the range of motion isn't effected as it is after weight lifting
 Doing lighter tension DVR exercises (e.g


the Miricle Seven exercises) while relaxing and breathing deeply between isometrics actually loosens you up faster and prepares you better for the next Iso exercise than stretching does
 Even so, after calisthenics I find stretching necessary

 Once again, this could be substituted with lighter tension 'tiger move' DVRs from M7.HISTORY AND REFERENCESSome say that Peterson's take on his history is somewhat naive
 I have no basis to judge this


 The section was interesting and inspiring for me, but I have not fact checked everything and I am not about to do so


 None of the historical background takes away from the exercise program


 Some have criticized Peterson for lack of references, but this is not a scholarly book on the subject of history of isometrics
 When it comes to the science of isometrics, the Hettinger literature can be found on Peterson's own website


 If you search more modern scientific literature, it appears that there are some more recent articles on the benefits of deep breathing for lowering blood pressure and isometrics for increasing muscle mass and weight loss.WRITING STYLEReligious references appear in this book, but are much toned down from Pushing Yourself To Power

 Once again, being a non-Christian these references didn't bother me
 I believe Peterson feels strongly about his religion and that it is so integral to his being that it is only natural for him to include such references
 Even if some are put off by them, they don't effect the utility of the exercises.There are also fewer 'manly' or 'macho' comments within the text when compared to PYTP
 Once again, this is Peterson being plain spoken

 If you want to take offense at the language, I suppose you could but in the context it is clear that he absolutely does not mean to offend
 My guess is he writes the way he talks

 This makes for a more natural narrative and makes the book easier to read and understand.I VANT TO LOOK LIKE ARNOLDThen take some steroids and lift some weights


 Peterson is the poster child for his methods

 If this is your ideal, Transformetrics will deliver

 But remember, Peterson is muscular, but he is not built like a professional body builder

 He believes that the body builder look is only achievable by taking steroids


 (The more I read, the more I agree with him, but I'm not an authority on this subject.)  That being said, a lot can be accomplished by using Isometrics and the full Transformetrics program

 But once again, you have to tailor your exercise program to what you want to accomplish.CONCLUSIONOn the whole, I am incredibly satisfied with this book


 It is of great value and the exercises really do work
 I believe that it is a worthy addition to Peterson's other titles, but would hesitate to recommend it as a stand alone manual


 For one, you need a good grounding in the Transformetrics style of exercise before you can get maximal benefit from isometrics

 And two,I don't think that isometrics alone  are versatile enough to be your only type of exercise
 However, when taken in the context of Peterson's Transformetrics program, this book is the ticket that will take you to the next level.

$review_text.: I love to crochet and I love bags!  In this book, there are 20 bags to crochet and then felt.The felting process is so easy.  Since you use wool yarn, you simply wash it in hot water in the washer and after removing, you put plastic bags or newspaper inside to form it properly while it finishes drying.Making these bags is so simple there are only four basic pages of instructions.  This is followed by the 20 project directions.  A colored photo with a skill level and approximate size are given first.  Then a materials list is provided.  The directions for crocheting the item are easy to follow.The final pages of the book provide a list of abbreviations, a chart for metric and U.S. hook sizes and a yarn type chart.  There is also a skill level definition page and a resources page in case you have a hard time finding the supplies.  The final page is a short bio about the author.This is a perfect book for making gifts for Christmas or for keeping for yourself.

He reads private documents not meant for his eyes and begins an obsessive search for the Knights Templar. We are soon introduced to Sarah and are told how important she is to this quest. Her blood line dates back to the time of Christ, and if she has a son she will be the future mother of His return.The Return had a lot of telling rather than showing for me. Also, I know this is fiction, but I had a hard time with the thought of a Roman Catholic Cardinal employing Regina, who disguised as a nun is also a dominatrix, murderer, and the Vatican's private attorney for special matters, as well as there being a secret soundproof room in the Vatican used for evil rituals, eluded sexual romps, and the worship of dark forces. For those who like to take breaks at a chapter's end, this book provides ample opportunity to do that; there are 102 chapters in all.The author seemed to squeeze too much into the story line and the love that Sarah and David had for each other read a little forced, we are told but never really feel it. But the author finds his voice for storytelling in the action. While the beginning contained impersonal dialogue between the characters, the end action made it worthwhile to keep reading. This book is the first of a series.

$review_text.: I tried. I really tried to savor 'Poor Man's Fight',but I just wolfed it down. And it was delicious. Elliot Kay is one of a few authors on my "auto-buy" list: It's such a treat to read what he creates, go into the worlds he designs, and become invested in the fates of his characters. And he's not precious with them - he makes his characters do terrible things. He beats the hell out them too.It's been pointed out in other reviews that Kay has a real gift for dialogue. When they speak his characters leap off the page with clever turns of phrase & speech rhythms that are as entertaining as they are familiar. That doesn't mean his descriptive writing is in any way "less" -- PMF is a big space opera that expands and contracts by Kay's design becoming vast and intimate at a turn of a page. Big conspiracies, shadowy corporations, shady government bureaucrats, and the ordinary people caught up in the ultimate designs - Kay zips the reader up and down the scale without a misstep.I wish I could write a review that does his work justice - something more than "I really really really really liked this book!" But ultimately that's what it comes down to.This is a really really really really good read.

$REVIEW.: In a weird sense this book surprised me. When I first read the blurb, it immediately grasped my attention but I did not expect to love it as much as I did. Frenched is sexy, romantic and such an exciting read.The novel starts as Mia is dealing with her emotions and the aftermath of her fiance canceling the wedding a week before their nuptials. She is depressed, humiliated and pretty devastated. Her friends convince her to take the trip that was supposed to be her honeymoon in France. Eventually she caves. At this point, I found that the story became a bit slow. She&#8217;s lonely, surrounded by all this lovey-dovey stuff in Paris and quite frankly I was a bit bored. I don&#8217;t think there was any other way for her to meet Lucas, she had to go though all of that for it to mean what it did, and eventually she gets there. And they meet, and she hates his subtle way of mocking her and his sense of rightness. (Okay, I&#8217;m having a brainfart here and I&#8217;m hoping you guys get what I&#8217;m trying to say when I say &#8216;rightness&#8217;.) But all of it leads to something, a sort of tentative friendship and this is where the story really starts.So Mia&#8217;s ex-fiance, Tucker, is rich and handsome&#8230; and that&#8217;s really it. He&#8217;s attention motivated (will only do things to gain an audience), terrible in the sack and an overall douche. Whereas Lucas is the opposite. He is different from Mia&#8217;s norm but he&#8217;s sweet, attentive, caring, generous and he calls her out on her princess act. He brings her out of her shell and helps her realize that all things in life don&#8217;t have to be planned. He spoils her and they are amazing together. One big aspect of this book is their romance and S-E-X. The romance was slow to build but their chemistry was instantaneously and so freaking hot! They can&#8217;t keep their hands off of each other and I enjoyed seeing their relationship evolve.Past the physical, the book was exciting and it was just one OMG after another and eventually a WTF moment that left me floored. Frenched is exciting and fun. It just got better with every page- With every chapter I read I felt even more attached to the book. It&#8217;s a book I would recommend and a series that I would see through. Frenched ends well but leaves a hint of things still unfinished. I am very much looking forward to uncovering them and seeing what Harlow comes out with next.

$REVIEW.: Title: The Girl in the PhotoAuthor: Wally WoodGenre: fiction/historical fictionReview:&#8203;The Girl in the Photo, written by Wally Wood, is part fiction, part historical&#8203;fiction. The novel is told from the point of view of three characters: Abbie,&#8203;David, and Dr. Emmerling.  The story opens with Abbie getting an urgentphone call informing her Dr. Emmerling, Abbie's father, had died.  After&#8203;recovering from the initial shock, she calls her younger brother to inform him of this tragic news.As David and Abbie meet together at Dr. Emmerling's old estate to take care of wills, obituaries and such.  There is quite palpable tension between the two siblings.  Abbie always feels as if she is the person bearing all the burden and responsibilities.  David feels as if Abbie has not changed from her &#34;older bossy sister&#34; attitude towards him even after 50+ years. Quite a bit of background information about these two characters were provided at the beginning of this book.  In short, progress and action was slow the first 25% of the book. Fortunately, the writing was mostly &#34;showing not telling&#34;, which made reading it tenfold more enjoyable had Wally taken on a &#34;telling not showing&#34; writing approach.&#8203;The action really starts to pick up when David finds a memoir left on his father's computer. Titled &#34;Mt. Koya&#34;, Dr. Emmerling recalls a life he has never talked about with his two children.  A surgeon for the army during World War I, Dr. Emmerling had been stationed in Japan.  I loved reading about his life in Japan...it was definitely the most interesting part of the novel.  As a reader, I got to be exposed to the Japanese culture of the period, which I found fascinating.&#8203;Personally, I felt that there were some unneeded chapters in the middle of the book. For example, I would much rather read about &#34;Mt. Koya&#34; than Abbie trying to write an obituary for her father.  Also, the switching from past to present tense somewhat interrupts the flow of my reading.  I want to be immersed into Dr. Emmerling's autobiography--I want to become emotionally attached to young Dr. Emmerling and Masami (his lover).  In other words, I would've loved it if the  &#34;Mt. Koya&#34; section of the novel was longer.Wally Wood sure threw in a curve ball for me when I read the ending of &#34;Mt. Koya.&#34;  I couldn't believe what had just happened (**trying not to spoil anything**) so I was relieved when I found out that Dr. Emmerling hadn't told the whole truth in the memoir. To quickly sum things up, David and Abbie find out Masami is alive in Japan and that they have a half sister.  The siblings decide to travel to Japan to meet their recently discovered family members.Most emotional part of the book: When Abbie and David inform Masami that Dr. Emmerling is dead.  I think my eyes might have teared up when Masami replies one of her greatest wish was to see him one last time before she passed on (she's probably in her 80's or 90's.)  The love Masami felt for Dr. Emmerling was so intense and legit that I truly wanted Masami to have a happy life.Overall, I enjoyed this book. It was a tad slow moving in the beginning, but it helped set up the scene and characters.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read some light romance, a story that deals with life and death and if you're interested in Japan during World War I.Likes:*Mt. Koya memoir was very well written&#8203;  *surprise twist near the endDislikes:*how it flipped from past to present then to past then to present again***a copy was given in exchange for an honest review***

$REVIEW.: Having already read Drunk in Love by Aria Grace, when I came across this book I bought it virtually without hesitation and it certainly didn't disappoint! Grace always manages to tell gripping stories that will not fail to connect with you on a personal level. The book follows the story of the likeable and simply adorable Shane as he moves away from his home to pursue his dreams both in terms of his career but also his sexuality. As well as human characters she also details the relationship between the men and an dog called Stormy. Call me sceptical but I don't usually go in for that kind of love, however I was quickly won-over as he was central to the whole story. The exciting plot-twist at the end of the book will leave you wanting more and I'm looking forward to reading more of Aria's novels!

I thought how good could this game really be?  Really good.  Amazingly good.  Addicting, fun and exciting.  However every one of my friends had been playing for a while, so to them everything was common knowledge and I was going in blind.  This E-book is a fantastic read for new players as well as seasoned players who want to get some fresh ideas.  Survival mode is a bit tricky at first and this guide made starting out a breeze, really setting you up for the future of your Minecraft experience.  Buy a Minecraft key and this Ebook as a gift for a friend, family member, or significant other and go hog wild on a saddle on a pig!

Well researched, we get a glimpse of her life before, during and after her trial.  The book covers the other alleged conspirators only as they touch her life.

$REVIEW.: It is the author's hope that the reader has a `rollicking good time' with this novella. With me her hopes were realised.It's an easy fun read and the story is told well. The language and pace suit the plot which develops seamlessly.It's set firmly in the modern day with Twitter being the means by which the five disparate protagonists come together through following the tweets of Frank, a freelance writer and blogger who is also a conspiracy theorist. Very quickly they become `the fearless five'. When Frank disappears for several days and leaves hints that all may not be well the others physically meet for the first time with the intention of tracking him down.This is a story of friendship with allusions to the Three Musketeers: all for one and one for all. At story end the friendship is well and truly cemented.It's a short novella but the characters are nicely drawn and the budding alliances work well. Which is good, because the author presages sequels.

$REVIEW.: I'm always a little bit wary when it comes to Christian Fiction, and even more so when it comes to Christian YA.  After all, what better place to lead people to the Lord than in their teens.I'm pleased to say that books such as It's Complicated are slowly changing my opinion of Christian YA fiction, and I couldn't be happier.This book follows four college freshmen as they try to navigate the stress, responsibility, and drama of college. It more specifically deals with the challenges Christian teen girls encounter when dealing with boys.Each roommate, Hannah, Kat, Palmer, and Claire, faces a different problem--or sometimes more than one--with the boys in their lives.  Hannah just wants to get a nice boyfriend to start off her freshmen year right, but it seems all the hot boys on the college campus are spoken for.  Well, all except the two which are chasing Kat.  She hardly has time for school and soccer practice, and certainly isn't looking to add a boyfriend to the mix even if she knew which boy she'd choose.Palmer on the other hand, is perfectly content with her high school boyfriend, although being at separate colleges is putting some strain on her relationship.  Until her boyfriend starts putting on the pressure for her to go farther than she's really looking to go.Petit little Claire just wants to survive her year without being noticed or losing her scholarship.  After a brief summer "flirtationship" turned into something much darker, the last thing she's looking for is a boyfriend.The interactions of these four girls with each other and a slew of hot college boys will have you turning pages, laughing, and crying.  The way these four girls find their strength in God without the book turning "preachy" is truly a breath of fresh air.However, this book does deal with some mature content and the pressures girls in relationships often face.  If you're looking for a book for your middle-schooler, I would encourage you to keep looking.  If you're an upperclassman high-schooler or college girl, though, this book might be exactly what you need to read.  As a high-school girl myself, I can say that this book was a really worthwhile read and it just might change the way you look at relationships.  I think this would also be a great book for Moms to get a glimpse of what their teen girls are facing the world of "Boy."Laura Smith did a wonderful job with voice of this book.  The tone sounds just like older teenage girls, which I think some YA authors struggle with.  The point of view shifts were sometimes confusing, but other than that, I really, seriously loved this book and can't wait for the next one in the Status Update series.Book Review by Sarah Faulkner, find more at inklinedwriters.blogspot.com

Anyone who studies this, should know that this system is nothing from any angel unless they are fallen but none the less, the only thing that I do not like is that Donald Tyson left out some talismans because it was supposedly a way of calling the demons! Laughable! The entire system of Enochian Magic is of demons-so I feel that an author shouldn't censor. Do not tell me that if I want such and such-to go and buy another book!

$review_text.: Even though the main motivator for most readers to buy this book is the fact that it is extremely inspirational, I also want to comment that Jan's writing style itself makes the book a pleasure to read.  I love how she is able to convey ideas with richness and simplicity at the same time.I also enjoyed how vividly she describes Bolivia, both through her own eyes, and through her mother's memories.  When I read about her family's arrival to St. Louis, especially the culture shock and language barriers, it occurred to me that she described these things in such a way that *anyone* would be able to understand them.  For example, I enjoyed the line about the new language sounding like indecipherable noises, especially as it is clear that this is a language the author now masters.There were so many things I loved about this book, and so many lines that stood out to me... as I was reading, there were many times where I either laughed out loud, gasped in shock or welled up - I think any reader would do the same.Hearing all of the things the author went through, especially in her experience of gradually losing her sight, it is hard for anyone to imagine, yet somehow she puts the reader in her shoes, and we can feel her emotions - shocked, horrified, fearful, angry, hopeful, determined, saddened, grateful, happy - all of these.  What a brave woman she is, and an inspiration to everyone.It is obvious that Jan is a natural communicator (no wonder she excels as an interpreter), someone who wants to reach out with her heart and share with others whatever she can to help so that they may draw on her experience.  But part of her success in communicating is that she has something important to express.  I thank her for being willing to share her story so candidly, and with such grace, for others to hear.I look forward to reading more from this writer.

$REVIEW.: Okay, this is a tough review to write..


because I just loved it so much! Emily and Gavin are by far my favourite book couple EVER


Their love is so deep and powerful and beautifully written that I just cannot get enough.I had high expectations when starting this book as Collide was one of the best stories I had ever read

I was concerned by the teasers Gail McHugh released that this book was going to contain too much angst and that their relationship would be too damaged to fully recover

I was so happy to find that this was not the case
Gavin and Emily's relationship only went from strength to strength in this continuation.This book will make your 'pulse' increase, your breath catch, your hope soar
You will love the laugh out loud humour but you will also cry, or if you are like me, you will be overtaken by racking sobs and need a stack of tissues!The highlighter function on my kindle went into overdrive with this one - I have so many favourite bits in this book! Gail's writing is beautiful

She has an uncanny way of writing from both POVs without writing from either

I just adore her work! I also love the fact that she teased me into thinking the book was heading in one direction and then took it in another, time and time again.Gavin is the most-swoon worthy book boyfriend ever written and I am really sad that I have finished this book
I have the worst book-hangover ever! If I could, I would give Pulse 6 stars!

$REVIEW.: &#34;I'd rather have ugly truths than pretty lies.&#34;I was left satisfied with Lucien and Sophie's story so I was unsure how I would like Kara being in the spotlight. I must say I enjoyed getting to know Kara better, she really is a feisty character and she had me laughing out loud many times. Of course I was pleased to see Sophie and Lucien were a huge part of this story and we got two couples for the price of one.Sophie, Lucien and Kara head to Ibiza to open up another club, a few years have lapsed since book two and their business has only gone from strength to strength. A tall, handsome american stranger turns up looking for work and even though Lucien has every reason not to, he hires him on a whim by his gut instinct alone. Dylan Day hints at secrets from the moment we meet him and as Kara falls under his spell, I knew it would all come tumbling out.I liked the setting of Ibiza, I felt the author did very well with the feel of the book and it captured the laid back, sunshine feel. I especially loved the 'The Love Tug', Dylan's accommodation during his stay and the scene of many a hot time for him and Kara.Kara's life had been filled with liars and she told Dylan he would be no exception so he dare not cross her.&#34;I meant every word of it, Dylan Day. Lie to me and I'll cut your c*** off and pickle it.&#34;And Dylan really should have heeded the warning. Of course his past turns up to haunt him and at this point I couldn't help but feel sorry for them both. Kara was in too deep and Dylan genuinely wanted to start a fresh and be someone else, his intention was not meant to hurt Kara but instead set himself free.There were some really lovely scenes, especially with Sophie and Lucien and their special day on the beach, even for Kara and Dylan it was a lovely time. But Dylan put off telling Kara the truth and I was reading with bated breath as I knew the inevitable would happen and it would all come spilling out.Knight and Day was a good end to the trilogy, we got to know Kara better and enjoy some hot sexy times with her perfect match in Dylan Day, I was especially pleased to see Lucien and Sophie's lives progress even further. The epilogue sure left me with a huge smile.I really like Kitty French's writing, she adds depth to her stories and creates endearing characters whilst simultaneously giving us a hot steamy read to devour. Fans of the series must read this today! ~Ava*I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.*

$review_text.: The title of Joseph Farah's None of the Above, Why 2008 is the Year to Cast the Ultimate Protest Vote, sums up my own feelings about the direction of our government and the upcoming election. Like many, I've been unhappy with the choices offered to us voters in the past. I've done the "plug my nose and vote for the lesser of two evils" ballot. In the primary here in California this spring, the field was pretty limited by the time the elections arrived. My original choice was, of course, long gone. For the first time, in over 30 years of voting, I found myself with nobody to support in the primary. However, I had such an aversion to the frontrunner I found myself voting for a candidate I actively disliked, disapproved of and would have never voted for in the general election. I regretted it as soon as I finished casting the ballot. I've always, and I mean always, taken voting very seriously; read up on the candidates, and supported who I felt the best person for the job would be. I promised myself that I'd never vote for someone again, unless I believed they were the best we had to offer.Farah's book caught my eye with the title; since that's just the way I've been feeling about the upcoming election. The book addresses the authors' belief that now is the time for radical and revolutionary thinking. That when we chose "the lesser of two evils", this means that we are still participating in something "evil". Farah reminds us that we won't get the Constitutional government our founding fathers fought for, if we don't demand it. The Constitution of our country is an amazing document, but we've allowed all three branches of government to gut it and render it irrelevant. Patrick Henry said, "The Constitution is not an instrument for the government to restrain the people, it is an instrument for the people to restrain the government - lest it come to dominate our lives and interests."  This document was to limit the power that government had over our lives, not allow it to be our nanny. We were to be self-governing, and yet we've allowed ourselves to be convinced that all our dreams can come true if we put our faith in our leaders.  As Farah says, "dependency of government is the opposite of freedom and responsibility. In the long term, it means tyranny and slavery."None of the Above makes compelling arguments, which any American can readily understand. The authors love of this country and the freedoms enumerated in the Constitution are obviously of the utmost importance to him. Farah also is a Christian, and his faith is an integral part of his thesis. He uses Biblical reference throughout and refers often to his own beliefs. This type of theologically driven ideology may detract from his thesis in the minds of some readers. It might be easier for a reader who has a different or no religious background to discount the book as a whole, instead of realizing that the ideas contained within the book are relevant to all Americans, religious or not. I don't necessarily agree with all of Farah's idea, I find I have a more of a Libertarian perspective on many social issues.  However when it comes to protecting the Constitution, I'm with him 100%. We have to stop taking it for granted.Joseph Farah's book reminds us that, "The strength of the Constitution lies entirely in the determination of each citizen to defend it. Only if every single citizen feels duty bound to do his share in this defense are the constitutional rights secure."  (Albert Einstein)

$REVIEW.: Like Clockwork by Bonnie DeeCarina Press, 201094 pagesRomance; Steampunk3.5/5 starsSource: Received a free e-copy via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.This was a pretty enjoyable novella.  Victoria Waters helped invent automatons but has since regretted the rapidity with which they have  spread through society, taking on roles far beyond the scope she had imagined.  Dash is part of the Brotherhood, a group of concerned citizens who may take radical action to raise awareness about the plight of the unskilled masses who have been displaced by automatons.  Their first radical act is kidnapping Victoria...until it turns out that she willingly agrees to help, eager to do right and to spend more time with the charming Dash.This is pretty much a case of love at first sight, which I think works in a novella because there's only so much space.  Although their classes are basically opposite, the two struggle against expectations (she was supposed to be a wife and mother while he is a thief yet both aspire to more academic lifestyles) separately and together.  Thus although their romance was quick, they had least had some commonalities.The other aspect is the steampunk; although the issue of automatons grips society, I didn't feel that steampunk elements played a very big role.  It is much more about human emotions, a point made very clearly.This all occurs against the background of the Slasher, a sort of Jack the Ripper serial killer who cuts the hearts out of female prostitutes.  I briefly fingered the culprit but quickly dismissed that idea focusing on someone who seemed more likely-shows what I know!Overall: A quick little romantic read with a very steamy conclusion.

$review_text.: I have to admit I wasn't able to finish this book


 There's nothing inherently wrong with it

 I just found it too wordy, too descriptive, and too religious


 I made it about halfway before I had to stop.I think the biggest problem for me was that this book was advertised as a murder mystery/thriller when it was actually an overly religious novel

 The murder was in the background and only as a plot device to consider the major point of the book...the battle between good and evil
 I just found myself frustrated with the religious themes and all of the unnecessary Latin phrases thrown in just for kicks.The characters were all such characters

 There wasn't a regular one among them

 Almost every character introduced had their own completely farfetched backstory

 The police officer has psychic tendencies...come on!  It wasn't even introduced in an organic way...it was just told to the reader.Honestly, I don't mind theological elements in the books I read, but I can't read novels that are centered around it

 Perhaps it's my fault for not understanding what this book was going to be about, but I felt cheated
 I tried to give it a fair shot, but unfortunately it didn't hold my attention.

$review_text.: I loved Hay's earlier novel, A Student of Weather but was extremely disappointed in this offering.  The story is character driven, but the main characters aren't particulary interesting or believable.  Their (endless) ruminations about films are so banal I kept wondering if the author was deliberately making fun of them.  The fact that main character Harriet is supposed to be a writer is also hard to buy into, given her slightly creepy and thoroughly pedestrian missives to her idol, Pauline Kael. The setting is supposedly contemporary, but the characters' sensibilities and interests seem oddly constricted and old fashioned -- as when husband Lew flees the undercurrent of marital tensions by retreating to his room to play his mandolin. If you like to hang out with people who revere Guys and Dolls as one of the greatest films ever made, and consider the question &quot;Sinatra or Astaire?&quot; the height of probing film criticism, this book is for you.

$REVIEW.: Right in time for holiday giving, "Cocktails: The Bartender's Bible", by Simon Difford, is a wonderfully comprehensive collection of over 3000 drink recipes, PLUS a "how to" guide for basic bar-tending


This book is perfect for beginners as well as seasoned cocktail mavens


It begins with the basics: tools, garnishes, glassware, etc


 The book is well illustrated and the cocktails are in alphabetical order


I'm a self-declared Manhattan "expert" so I turned immediately to that page and was pleased to find that my recipes jive with theirs.With over 3000 cocktails, there are of course the classics (e.g., Old Fashions, Manhattans, Side Cars, Martinis) but also plenty of new cocktails that I'd never heard of such as a Darth Vader, Fur Collar, Side Err and a Woxum, to name a few

The book does recommend certain name brands of liquors and mixers, but they can be easily substituted for your personal favorites.The "coffee table" heft and size of the book and the brightness of the illustrations and quality of the paper, in my opinion, justifies the reasonable price point and this would make a gift you would be proud to give particularly for a wedding shower or a housewarming.

$REVIEW.: Robert Taylor was one of the great actors of Hollywood's golden age and one of its most underrated.  He starred in many classic films opposite some of the great leading ladies of the era.  He was also one of the most modest and self effacing of leading men.  Linda Alexander has done a superb job researching and putting together the life of Spangler Arlington Brugh (Taylor's real name).  She has done an especially fine job on his early years--the years that molded him--growing up in Nebraska.  Taylor might be remembered more today by mainstream critics if it were not for his testimony before the House UnAmerican Activities Committee (HUAC) as a so-called "friendly" witness in 1947.  Alexander convincingly shows us a man who was reluctant to give such testimony and in many ways was given no other choice by his studio--MGM.  To many this was an unforgivable sin, and Taylor's reputation has paid a price.  He belonged to the same MGM hierarchy which included Gable, Crawford, Tracy and Harlow and, as good a screen actor as any of them, yet to a certain extent not given the same creative appraisals as his contemporaries.  This book changes that.  Well done!

$REVIEW.: Executive Outcomes in Action!"Four Ball One Tracer: Commanding Executive Outcomes in Angola and Sierra Leone" by Roelf van Heerden as told to Andrew Hudson. This book covers operations by Executive Outcomes (EO) which was a private military company founded in South Africa in 1989. It later became part of the South African-based holding company Strategic Resource Corporation. EO provided military personnel, training and logistical support to officially recognized governments only. Where assistance was given to corporations in conflict areas, EO had the host government's approval to provide such assistance.EO initially trained and later fought on behalf of the Angolan government against National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) after UNITA refused to accept the election results in 1992. In a short space of time, UNITA was defeated on the battlefield by EO and sued for peace.In March 1995, the company contained an insurrection of guerrillas known as the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone, regained control of the diamond fields, and forced a negotiated peace. In both these instances they are credited with rescuing the legitimate government in both countries from destabilizing forces. Ultimately in the end both had mixed results.The also illustrates how EO was notable in its ability to provide all aspects of a highly-trained modern army to the less professional government forces of Sierra Leone and Angola. For instance, in Sierra Leone, Executive Outcomes fielded not only professional fighting men, but armor and support aircraft such as two Mi-24 Hind and two Mi-8 Hip helicopters, the BMP-2 infantry fighting vehicle and T-72 main battle tank.  It also possessed medical evacuation capabilities for the wounded. Overall, the book is a very good insight to EO and conflict in Africa.

$review_text.: Absolutely hilarious. The first to be satirized, outsmarted by locals, is the British judge, the RM for Royal Magistrate, who arrives in rain, compelled to buy a horse from his savvy landlord who's already overcharging. The house is vast, with unexplored inner reaches--unexplored until various fugitives lodge there.Without fear of contradiction, the best fox hunt in all of literature, an Irish fox hunt with everyone participating, bicycles, carts, several horses of varied abilities and instincts regarding walls, ditches and fences.I do not know the current state of Irish reaction to this book, whether it is seen as baldly critical: humor always has that possibility of serious misapprehension. (Many readers of Confederacy of Dunces resent the book, though it is a modern classic.) But take it from me, with an Irish surname at least, Hilarious.I suppose ethnic humor is so widespread in the US--as it is in Shakespeare's Henry V, where it is used to abrade difference, to create Great Britain now coming apart into its contributive bloodlines and languages.  Poles tell Polish jokes, Jews tell jokes about Jews, in the US--why, even the Irish make moderate fun of themselves.

$REVIEW.: Kayden Kayden Kayden&#8230;&#8230;A man who was truly flawed and suffered much in his life. He turned to sex, drugs, and alcohols to function in life and get over his pain.Kayden: The Past reveals the life of Kayden and how he became the man he is today and is the second book in the Love At Last series. If you&#8217;ve read Untangle Me, then you know that Kayden had a few issues that he needed to work through in order to be abetter man for Sophia and his son.This book starts with Kayden heading off to counseling to help him deal with his past. At the suggestion of his counselor, he writes down all of the times in his life where he spiraled out of control, and boy oh boy, did he follow his counselor&#8217;s instructions. He wrote about it ALL, and you learn so much about Kayden especially his poor choices in women like that crazy Lisa. P.S. Lisa also popped up in Untangle Me, and now we have their background. Lisa was/is CRAZY!!!!!!!!!!!Anywho, this book was like reading a lover&#8217;s journal. Would I want to read it? No, because I don&#8217;t want their past to taint my idea of him. Do I feel like it needs to be done? Yes, if it will help you sort out your demons for the sake of our happy ending.After reading this, I don&#8217;t feel like I like Kayden any more or less, but I do feel like I understand him more. I appreciate that his journal entries were more like snapshots instead of being very detailed. I don&#8217;t need the particulars just the general idea of what happened. I could care less about the random conversations he may have had with these women or what they wearing. I just want to know how you met this person and what about this person affected you.  Simple right?What came first the chicken or the egg? That&#8217;s how I felt when trying to decide if I liked Untangle Me or Kayden better or which one do I think should have come first. Here is what I think: I think that Kayden: The Past should have come second. I feel that without reading about his relationship with Sophia in Untangle Me, I wouldn&#8217;t have cared about his past. I liked Untangle Me better because I am more of sappy, romantic girl. I like to see a couple grow in a book, and because Kayden was more about his diddle daddles, I gave this book 3.75 stars. It was a quick read full of dirty deeds that will grab your attention and help you understand the broken hero of Untangle Me. Although this book could be read without reading Untangle Me, I don&#8217;t suggest it.

$REVIEW.: This little memoir is more than just Patchett's reflections on her own writing experiences.  It offers advice to would-be writers in a way that engages the reader and empathizes with their struggles.  She offers up her own practices and then admits that everyone has their own writing process.  By defining what works for her, she is in no way setting guidelines, yet she illustrates how discipline is the key factor to getting words and ideas on paper.  There were so many aspects I could relate to, having studied writing in college, and being taught by eccentric but inspiring professors.  I have yet to fully submit myself to the craft, but I know I can always turn to Patchett's words in The Getaway Car when motivation is ever needed.I received a complimentary copy of this work from the author.

$REVIEW.: Okay, so a review without rehashing the plot and giving away any plot details...let's do this.Having never read the first book in the series, I was really surprised how well this read as a standalone book
Anything from the previous book was told in as much detail as needed and then the reader is brilliantly transported into the new story.So this story, aah, so good
Contemporary romance with a twist, it's from a male perspective, and it's awesome


Trey Miller isn't your typical bad boy that graces every book I've read recently

He doesn't have some deep dark secret just waiting to get out and shock the reader with his dark and twisted past


He's just an awesome, sexy, CEO, gorgeous business man, did I mention how hot he was?The story has a cool little twist between the characters, that the reader sees way before the characters do.I loved the interactions between the main characters Faith and Trey
It was playful, sexy, flirting at its best and made me smirk and chuckle along with them.My favorite character by far though had to be Jett--treys younger brother

He's so cocky and un-charming, yet totally made me grin like a school girl every time he graced the pages, and thankfully TK makes sure he graces them a lot.The ending had me sniffling, and smiling all at the same time and when I finally closed the book...I went and bought book one so I could get more of my fill of Trey, and find out how this gorgeous, sexy male became the loving man he is.

The concept is intriguing and generally, I like the execution, too: every man and male animal on Earth dies in a single moment, all that is but one, the strangely named Yorick, and his male Capuchin monkey. What follows is the female dystopia as women inherit the Earth and Yorick goes underground to stay alive and find a way to save the species.Where I struggle is with how the author writes nearly every woman in the story (and, but for Yorick, they're ALL women) to carry a hatred for every man that they ever knew, despite them all being dead and gone.Despite the heavy handed feminism and occasional political message, it's an interesting concept, and I look forward to reading the sequels.

$REVIEW.: &#34;Last Light Falling&#34; caught my attention from the very start, weaving a story about a dystopian society on the brink of an even more ravaged world as destiny and fate come into play in the life of twin siblings Arena and Gabe. J.E. Plemons sucks readers in with vivid storytelling, authentic characters, emotionally charged drama, thrilling action and a smoothly unfolding larger plot that promises a fantastic series. What I liked about this novel is that it blends religious elements with sweeping supernatural fantasy, creating a multi-layered story to really sink your teeth into as Arena and Gabe find themselves tasked with a destiny that will reshape the world in great and powerful ways. When I finished this I was eagerly to read more and delve even deeper into this intriguing and imaginative series.

$REVIEW.: I chose this rating for the shear fact that is was indeed a great read it kept my interest throughout the whole story. The only thing negative I have to say is that I feel the ending or conclusion of this second novel was rushed a bit but that may be just my own personal opinion. Can't wait until the next one is out!

$review_text.: This short story is the prequel to the soon to be released book by Morgan Jane, Sanguis City. In this book, we get to meet two very intriguing characters, Lily (Lilanior) and Crow. Lily has always known that she was different; that she wasn't like everyone else she grew up with. This short story details Lily's life before has to leave her village after finding out what she truly is. She also is grasping at the possibility of love and life with the completely fascinating Crow.I will say, that while paranomal/fantasy isn't a genre I have a lot of experience with reading, Morgan Jane has totally captivated me with this story, and I am dying to learn more about what happens to Lily. I am really looking forward to reading Sanguis City, and I would be lying if I said I didn't want to know more about Crow as well. He just sounds dreamy, swoonworthy and utterly intriguing.

$review_text.: Kancho Joko Ninomiya (founder of Sabaki Method-Eshin Karate) and Ed Zorensky have produced an outstanding text in martial arts sparring and fighting strategies.Though this book quickly goes over basic punches and kicks, it is not a primer on the subject
 These techniques are more of an introduction to prepare the practitioner for the rest of the book
 It is filled with much information on distancing, takedowns and follow-ups, offensive and defensive strategies.The still photos give you a visual assessment of what is being discussed and drills you can use to train with


There is a short section on self-defense training and kata that is somewhat out of place; However, this book is so good compared to most martial arts instruction books, that these sections are easily overlooked

 The authors probably should devote another book to those topics, especially self-defense.A highly regarded text that every karateka who is serious about either sparring or "real" fighting should own
 The only other book comparable to this on the subject of sparring is "American Freestyle Karate" by Dan Anderson.

$REVIEW.: I'd read Days Between Stations, and I finished it in a day and was haunted for long after. Zeroville was the same. It still haunts me. Erickson is a master crafter and story teller and his characters are unlike any you've ever read. He writes with emotion, it sticks with you, it doesn't leave. He's not heavy, he's not going for the big punches at the end of the book to shock you into thinking something else. There are no dips in his novels, especially not in Zeroville. It is consistent from start to finish and it is a great time. I loved it so much I bought it for all my friends for Christmas. They have all confessed their dedication to Erickson as a voice and a genius. This book is the best.

We also get to learn more about the Royal family and their traditions.  Chey and Sander's relationship is constantly being tested.  There are so many obstacles for them to be able to make their relationship work and at this point, Chey is not even sure it is worth all the troubles.In this instalment, we experience heartbreak .  We feel devastated for Chey but are still hopeful that the girl will hopefully get her Prince.  The book was well written and moved at a good pace.  I can't wait to finish this series.

I wanted to yell and scream  during some parts and cried like a baby at others. I was sad when I finished it beacause I did not want it to end!!

It was interesting to learn to the power of this strategy and how it&#8217;s been used to predict many significant occurrences in the market throughout history. The graphs were really helpful.

$review_text.: &#8220;The Word of God is the constitutive reality at the heart of the Church.&#8221; (18)There are as many ideas about how to grow a church as there are books on the subject. There are books that focus on meeting felt needs, worship strategies, small groups and a myriad of other ministries that can be maximized to grow your church. However, what many of these books fail to recognize or address is that the bedrock of growing a church is the ministry of the Word through preaching.With a biblical focus on the Word of God at the heart of a church Alec Motyer has written Preaching?: Simple Teaching on Simply Preaching. As the Old Testament editor for The Bible Speaks Today series, Motyer has turned his pen to writing on preaching and has written a book that addresses both the biblical-theological aspects as well as some practical issues.The first five chapters address the nature of preaching. These chapters are exegetically grounded in various passages of Scripture. Motyer defines good preaching as that which has a &#8220;sense of being plain and unmistakable.&#8221; (11) Preaching that is good is to be expositional, that is, &#8220;the restatement of a Scripture.&#8221; (30) Motyer wants to impress upon his readers that preaching is the ground upon which the whole church grows and functions. All ministry grows out of the Word and the preaching of the Word. His exegetical work deals with many NT passages that provide us with the nature and task of faithful biblical preachers. His observation, especially of the book of Acts, is that it is the ministry of the preaching of the Word that drove the growth of the early church. Surely there were other attending contributions, like the work of the Spirit through the Word, but it was always the Word that led the way and was responded to.The second half of the book addresses several issues surrounding sermon prep along with some discussion on application and the spiritual life of the preacher. For sermon preparation, Motyer discusses five aspects: examination, analysis, orientation, harvesting and presentation. These deal with knowing and understanding the resources available for good exegesis, doing the task of exegesis itself and extracting the heart of a text for presentation. On the preachers spiritual life, Motyer turns to the lives of Paul, Ezekiel and Isaiah to draw practical encouragement and direction as the preacher does his divine task. In chapter thirteen, Motyer continues this focus on the life of the preacher as he highlights Paul&#8217;s words in Acts 20:28 to &#8220;take heed to yourselves.&#8221;Preaching? is exactly as the subtitle states, a book that has simple teaching on simply preaching. Motyer does not break new ground on the nature and practice of preaching. What he does is give us a good reminder of the preachers responsibility as a minister of the Word of God. This is a great primer on preaching for preachers young and old.

The main characters of the book, Amy and Jack, both had serious problems of there own. Amy, even if she wasn't very fat, always thought of herself as fat. This is because her ex-boyfriend/fiance always said to her about how fat she was. Why was she with him again? I don't know. On Amy's wedding day, she comes into a room and sees her fiance kissing another girl. Oh and this girl was her best friend. Imagine how horrible that'd be? I mean, the story shows her misfortune and it makes me sad for her very much.Jack has problems to, but we don't see the entire story. I know this book is three parts, but the book was uncompleted it feels. However, aside from the unfinished feeling of Jack's part, I am excited to read the next one. I want to see where this is going to go and what's going to happen.I recommend this book to readers who like sweet, sexy romance, but not to heavy.Rating: 5.9/10Parental Rating: 16+

$REVIEW.: Alaina McKinley has moved to the house she inheritited from her parents.  But, she has a neighbor that runs a hunting club right next door and they don't appear to be very careful on what, when and where they hunt.  The night that Alaina is woken up with shots coming into her house, she calls the sheriff, extremely mad and upset.  While hiding from any further bullets, Alaina finds a black panther in her barn.  She just knows that he was what the hunters were shooting at and decides to protect him instantly.Raphael Doucette has traveled from his home country to avenge his mate and cubs.  He has tracked down the person who took his mate as the owner of a hunting club.  Raphael has even discovered the mounted head of his mate on the owner's wall.  Revenge is all Raphael is really thinking about when he hides in Alaina's barn after being injured. Raphael may not want to be involved in another relationship, but he has already decided that he will have Alaina.Alaina decides to shield and help the Black Panther "Ralphie" heal from his wounds.  Alaina is not aware that Ralphie is actually Raphael and is worried when he starts to show sexual intentions toward her.  After yet another shooting on her property, Alaina watches as Ralphie becomes Raphael.  Shaken and scared of this new development, Alaina runs from Raphael.  But this is not the last of the attacks on Alaina and Raphael by her neighbor.  Knowing that this is the only way to avenge his mate and keep Alaina safe, Raphael plans on a final attack on the hunting club.  When all is said and done, will Raphael stay to see if there is anything between them that will last or will Alaina just be left with memories of passion and gunshots?Nocturnal is a dark paranormal that centers around a black panther shifter who only wants to avenge the murder of his mate and cubs.  Raphael really isn't looking for a future, he just wants to be able to end the past.  Alaina wants to enjoy her home and not have to worry about being accidentally shot one night.  Alaina and Raphael come together more from need then want at first.  As their time together goes on, the feelings begin to change to a different type of need.  I found Nocturnal to be a dark and moody story and there were places in the story where the subject matter took me totally out of the plot because I found actions to be skirting the edges.  Another aspect that I could not get into was seeing the characters as a couple rather than two people thrown together by unusual circumstances.A warning to readers: There are a few shifter/human sexual scenes that may be uncomfortable or even distasteful.Joreviewed for Joyfully Reviewed

$review_text.: The blurb gives a great picture of what the book is about, so I'll just skip to the meat of a good review: Read
This

Book


Colin and Marek are both well-rounded characters and, while the majority of the book takes place in a rather short time, the connection the two have is believable, the issues with each other and within themselves are genuine
Jordan and Tag, supporting characters and Colin's friends, while used sparingly, have a definite dynamic with Colin and are perfectly utilized in the story


Not to give anything away, but one line in the book actually made me cry

When you see it, you'll know


So, again, if you're looking for a good m/m romance that's so much more than a handful of sex scenes with very little plot, you must read this book.

$review_text.: This book takes a unique look at Apple's signature product and how it has changed the way people listen to music. The book is divided into two sections.The first section consists of the first three chapters.  The iPod is introduced, and its basic functions and history explained. The rest of the book is the second part. It covers a large number of iPod topics at random. Material covered includes homemade iPod ads, the custom iPods of some celebrities, iPod DJs, and products that have been invented as a result of the iPod's existence. Stylistically, the book is designed to resemble the iPod. For example, the cover resembles the front of an iPod, and the table of contents looks like an iTunes library list. In spite of being 160 pages long, you can read the book in less than two hours due to the large number of colorful photos present.The book is more about the cultural impact of the iPod than its inner mechanics. It is not one of those "Missing Manuals" you often see. There is a fascinating exploded view of the iPod internals on pages 36 and 37, but more interesting - at least to me - was the discussion on iPod jacking starting on page 103. There are also stories about people using their iPods to block out the rest of the world, people using the white ear buds to show they are part of the "iPod group", and alternatively, people who use ordinary earphones to hide the fact that they are using an iPod who are trying to assert that they do not follow the crowd.There are humorous stories about the perils of being an iPod-using Microsoft employee, and serious ones such as the one about posters that mimic iPod ads but are actually protesting the Iraq war. There really is something here for everyone. Don't let its "coffee table book" look fool you - there really is some deep and thoughtful material here.

$REVIEW.: Rob J Cole is the only name you need to know.  The first is a 1000 AD healer and adventurer, larger than life, with a gift for sensing the vitality of any person who joins hands with him.  His search for knowledge of healing and his destiny take him from London through Europe to Constantinople and then on through the mid-eastern countries till he studies medicine, as good as it could get back then, at a most famous hospital. The obstacles he faces are daunting and innumerable, making for great suspense throughout.  Finally he makes his way back to his wife's holding in Scotland and practices medicine happily for the rest of his days.  In Shaman, we visit Cole's descendant in 1800's in the midwest of the United States just prior to, during, and after the Civil War.  Shaman does not have the adventures of the first Rob J, but he still has 'the gift' and the tale is much more 'realistic' but really less interesting than The Physician.  Last, Matters of Choice is the story of RJ, a doctor in the 2000's beginning in Boston and ending in the rural hill country of New England, where the latest descendant of the original Rob J pursues her own destiny and value in becoming a family physician in a small community instead of the celebrated specialist she had set out to become in her life.  Noah Gordon handles the history and geography that underly his stories with ease, and the terrific diversity of cultures his story moves within never obscure the clarity of his characters lives and motives.  These are united at a much deeper level than just the family name and are themselves a 'gift' of the highest order for his readers.

$REVIEW.: 4.5 stars.I read about Jake and Tor with pleasure

In this sequel toBarebackJake has to face many things: managing the ranch, the loss of his sister, raising his nephew


It seems he is in control and balanced, but by the end of the book we realize that he's working himself to exhaustion, trying to be the perfect manager and uncle, and neglecting his own needs, without asking for help


Tor is his sanity check this time

The book is not as angsty and dramatic as the first, it's also shorter, but it has such tender moments between the two men that it makes you yearn for that kind of connection


Maybe it's because the first book was my first m/m, it made a tremendous impact on me, so I felt that this one is less intense
This is still one of my favorite couples ever, though.

$SUMMARY.: 4.5 stars


Very good sequel

Guess always delivers!I was a bit concerned that a &#34;Super Hero&#34; genre type book would be such a departure from the introspective and insightful ability of Guess to write about the human condition

I was so wrong!I will apologize for my doubts! I will never doubt Guess and his ability to keep in touch with the inner workings of a cast of characters minds and still create a rich and believable world, even if it is populated with Heroes, Zombies or anything else he can dream up!This is a great intro story to the world he is inviting you to spend some time in! There is enough detail to keep you reading, and just enough teaser information to make you beg for more at the end

The pacing is great, the characters are believable and flawed, even though some of them are &#34;Super&#34;.I am impressed and really recommend you give this a shot!

$review_text.: Mackenzie may know a lot about the mythology of werewolves, but she has no clue they actaully exist until she gets bitten and goes through the change herself.  Terrified of what she may do when she turns on the full moon, she runs.  When the female alpha of a very large pack finds her and invites her to stay with them so they can guide her through the transition, she jumps at the chance.  It doesn't hurt that the very cute and charming Geoff will be with her every step of the way either.  But something doesn't feel right, and when Mackenzie starts to figure a few things out, she realizes that things may be even worse than she first thought they were.The Tempering got off the a bit of a slow start for me with Mackenzie really sinking into a moping phase.  I don't blame her for the emotion, it would suck to get changed the way she was, but it did seem to get a little repetitive.  Once she meets the other wolves, things change quickly and the story takes off running.  This was a big turning point in the momentum of the storyline and it was just far more interesting that the very beginning.I really loved Mackenzie's character.  She's not ashamed of the fact that she isn't the perfect woman, and she doesn't let anyone talk down to her.  Her attitude was fantastic and once she got used to her new life, we see it come back with a little werewolf confidence to back it all up.  I wasn't a big fan of Geoff until near the end and I'm still reserving judgement until I see what they are up to in book two.  A pretty good start to a series, I'm not sure when book two will be out, but I'm going to keep an eye out for it.- See more at: [...]

$REVIEW.: I wasn't sure what to expect when I first picked up this book and was pleasantly surprised by Christine Edward's style of writing.She pulled me right into the story, the love triangle of sorts, the danger and the mountains!  Violet's tough determination to study the wolves and protect them is a strong pull on my own heart.  Luke's almost overbearing commanding presence is almost stereotypical of a lumberjack (at least where I grew up).  Damon's almost too smooth, hidden dangerous presence is captivating.Luke and Damon have past history from growing up in the small town that is just boiling below the surface that starts to boil over when they both decide they must have Violet.  I don't want to give too much away...read the book for conclusion...Who does Violet pick Luke or Damon?  How many dangers does Violet have to face?

 The characters were "real", and I like that

 I especially enjoyed the main character, Mace

 I fell in love with the Father and was sad to see him go

 I gave this book 5 stars because the story line was fluid, the characters were almost human and real, and the book had very little errors

$REVIEW.: Any Eve Langlais book in my hands is sure to be a pleasurable read. A Ghostly Menage did not leave me wanting for anything. That&#8217;s not exactly true. This sexy little tale left me wanting a haunted house in the country with two hot werewolves wanting to do sinfully delightful things to me, dirty things. Sadly Jenna gets Derrick and Mark and all of their naughty.Derrick and Mark are best friends that share everything in life. They are quite content with everything they have. They enjoy all life has to offer until a witch with devious goals and nefarious plans sets a spell on them that has them haunting their own home. The haunting turns to ghostly groping when Jenna moves in and they discover she is so much more than the new owner.Jenna thinks her new home is simply old and has a personality of its own. It takes some sexy dreaming to discover that there is definitely personality involved in what is going on with her new home. In fact it is the personalities of two ghostly inhabitants trapped under a witch&#8217;s spell that has her experiencing a very touchy feely welcome wagon.This tale is short and sexy and overflowing with sass and brass. Jenna complements her boys well. Mark and Derrick contrast enough that Jenna gets the best of everything these men have to offer.book provided by the author for the purpose of an honest review

$review_text.: If anyone wants to read this book solely because it has been forbidden to do so by the hated Vatican, I have news for him: The Vatican does not forbid you to read this book! The Vatican merely says that the book contains errors. Yes, once upon a time the Vatican did have a list of prohibited books; it was called the Index Librorum Prohibitorum (not, as a previous reviewer renders it, the "Index Prohibitorium Liboranium"). Shielding people from harmful ideas --- and ideas can be harmful --- once seemed like a good idea, but the authorities of the Church gave it up some time ago. Now it is practiced only at Harvard University (cf. the recent persecution of Pres. Summers), Columbia University (cf. the recent persecution of students who are pro-Israel), and at other citidels of progressive thought.In any event, it seems very odd to want to read a book simply because the Pope disapproves of it, especially if one is a Catholic and believes the Pope is the successor of the Apostle Peter. It also seems strange that Christians would use such uncharitable language as "Rat-slinger", "thought Gestapo", etc. Please, more charity.

 Instead it turned into the biggest sleeping pill ever
 No matter whether I was sitting, standing or reclining I would read for a while and off to sleep I'd go


 Unfortunately sleeping in the daytime is not what I needed


 It might have a totally different effect on others but I'll only keep it because it is a good sleeping pill.....and didn't cost me a thing.

$REVIEW.: My book review is on the book Coming Undone by Staci Stallings. This story is a heartbreaking story of a man journey to find peace with a dying father and the situation of a broken family. It is very well written and will touch your heart. I enjoyed the book even though it dealt with the transition of life unto death in a hospice facility.Ben Warren is a man going through life on the fast track. He works hard but plays harder with out a care in the world; until the day he receives word that his father has had a massive stroke. His father is his hero and his best friend, how can he live without him?Kathryn Walker is a social worker in a hospice care facility at the hospital. It is her job to help the family and the patient make the transition from this life as easily as possible. Some families have a much more difficult time than others but she is there to support them no matter what. She believes this is her ministry and she has become very good at it.When Kathryn meets the worldly Ben Warren she is drawn to him. His eyes are full of pain and she can tell that he is coming undone, is that why she is drawn to him or is it a God thing? Ben doesn't know God that much is obvious, is she there to lead him to him or is there more.Ben doesn't believe in a God even though his father was a believer. Now his brother, that he had not seen since he was a small child and Kelly, Ben's best friend, are here and they believe in this God that the beautiful Kathryn seems to know and talk with. He doesn't understand any of it, he just knows the bottom has fallen out of his world and he has no way to fix it. the only time he can find peace is with Kathryn.His journey is intriguing and inspiring at the same time. Even though the subject matter can be painful, especially at time it is a very uplifting story. You need a copy of this book.

I really liked the chapter on intelligent food choices and habits for children because kids need guidelines. They cannot eat whatever they want whenever they want to. I had to purchase this book because I have a newborn and I want him to grow up the best way he can be and health is a major component of that. Good book and I look forward to more from this author.

This is Science Fiction yet encompasses elements from other genres like Romance and Fantasy which makes it a far more varied read
I liked some stories more than others, Rewind was my favourite and a great story to lead into the book, however I enjoyed elements from each of them and could not fault any

$review_text.: There's a bumper stiker around "If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention."  I have been one who has seen myself as ineffectual in the circumstances of these times.  Pema Chodron's work is a truly radical teaching of how we contribute to war and peace and the importance of our individual contributions to the state of the "world" we live in and the world the next generation will inherit.  Even if you don't agree with the positions she offers (some of the aspects of the teaching aren't "easy"), this work is thought provoking.  Even a little practice of these ideas leads to revelation about our individual importance in garnering peace or creating war.  We do make a difference.

$REVIEW.: I love road trip stories.  I mostly like those written by the tripper, but Matthew Algeo does a fine job standing in for Harry Truman who is not available.  One does that by conducting extensive research, and Algeo has laid magnificent groundwork.  The reader is almost at home with Harry and Bess in HARRY TRUMAN"S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE.In June of 1953, Harry and Bess Truman left their Independence, Missouri, home in a 1953 Chrysler New Yorker and headed east.  They were wanting anonymity but that was a false hope because, after the first sighting, they were dogged the entire trip by reporters, political acquaintances, cabbies, waiters, bell hops, police officers and citizens, all wanting to meet the ex-president.  One could hardly expect anything different upon seeing a dapper little guy with huge round glasses, crisp suit and tie, big grin, two-toned shoes, and big Panama hat, accompanied by a matronly and friendly wife, in a huge, black, shiny Chrysler, stopping for gas, coming through the front door of a caf&eacute; to eat, or approaching a motel desk looking for a room.  He'd only been out of office for about six months.  Who could forget Harry Truman?I have never been a fan of Truman's politics, particularly his decision to remove General Douglas MacArthur from command in Korea and Japan.  But I admired the spirit and single mindedness he displayed in the White House and his refusal to give in to his critics.  This trip was an extension of that individualism and, by golly; he was going to take this trip as a means of cooling off after ending his presidential duties.He was gracious with the hordes of pests.  He took the time to make public appearances as appropriate.  And he never missed an opportunity to try and upgrade his retirement with some governmental action that might grant him a little retirement money.  He was relentless in this regard, although he would probably cringe at the amount ex-presidents rake in now at taxpayers' expense.  But he certainly deserved the paltry amount finally granted to him.Algeo retraces the Truman route, staying in the same hotels and eating in the same restaurants.  He visits some of the same people the Trumans visited, and even stays in some of their homes.  He talks with people who met Truman and visited with him.  He digs up papers and mementos and even the skeleton of Truman's Chrysler, a car that is a main character in the story.The author continues the story after the Trumans returned to Independence, including the fence mending done between Harry and former rivals, his slow decline to crankiness, and, finally, his passing.  He was an incredible personality, as was Bess.  It was a pleasure to read of this peaceful period in his life.  I will be reading more of Algeo's works.Schuyler T WallaceAuthor of TIN LIZARD TALES

$review_text.: This series was, for me, simply a free book that I downloaded...it quickly became so much more. I hesitate to call it any of the basic words we use...story, novel, book, etc...because it surely belongs in a category all its own. I am left with an ache in my heart and a hauntingly beautiful image seared in my memory for Skyla and her band of men. Each person comes alive on the page so thoroughly that there are no characters who can be considered big or small. The town of Paragon calls me in the words written by Ms. Moore, assuring me that both friends and enemies await in the form of those I have come to love, hate, and long for from these pages. I believe the series is considered YA, but I am older and enjoyed them immensely. I do believe that Addison Moore belongs in the league of the paranormal greats....actually, she even exceeds them in my opinion. What Twilight, The Vampire Diaries, and this years other paranormal phenomenon brought in the form of vampires and werewolves, Addison Moore introduces us to a beautiful brand of what others won't touch...religion. Thank you, Ms. Moore!

This novel was an easier read than I expected and kept me on the edge of my seat!Von Bleichert's research shows since there is the right balance of fictional and technical aspects

I am pretty clueless when it comes to the technical aspects, My husband loved the book because of the technical aspects.In this book China considers Taiwan to be under Chinese jurisdiction so they invade the island
China wants to gain full control of Taiwan and the United States want to protect their interest in the Pacific

These two countries wanting to take of this island and the poor people of Taiwan are caught in the middle.I think this book would be great for those who love Military Fiction or new comers to the genre! 5 stars overall.

$REVIEW.: I know, I know...I wrote a really good review for the hardback copy (on accident) but then I had to think about it.  I was going on the fact that I'm familiar with the setting and that I've never read a book with a real  Hawaiian background.  That's really the only good thing about the book.  His character says words that don't fit.  Supposedly he reads a lot of  college level material in high school (things most people have not read!)  AND sells coke on the side and lots of other illegal things. I don't know  where he finds the time for that. Although his writing style is easy to  read (for locals, anyway), it still needs some work.  If your not from  Hawaii, please don't think that everyone on our island is like his  characters! Please no.  To end on a good note, Chris McKinney does do  a fair job in showing how parents affect their children's lives.  Living on  such a small island, its easier to see the connection from parent to child.  Anyhow, for all those people who want a taste of the non-commercial side  of Hawaii, this is a fair read.

I can't memorize all the questions and I can't write them all down. the doctor can't answer all my questions and so I read outside of his office to be prepared to go back in and ask the more important questions as to what I can do to help myself. I think I'm managing when I read about my disease. The book certainly has answered many of my questions, made me feel at ease more about myself. I cannot heal myself of my diseases, however it helps to understand them in reading about them. I feel more free when I know what I can do to help rid my body of a certain poison in order to help the healing.

$review_text.: This is a very short read--the entire download is close to 200 'Kindle locations' and is comprised of the title story consisting of about 70 locations, a secondary title of about 50 locations, and the balance consisting of a compilation of book blurbs.It's a little difficult to give summary when the stories are so short already--too much spoiler potential.  Instead of trying (and you can refer to the blurb provided under the book's description for details) I will just focus on what I thought.For the title piece, well, basically, I was pretty blown away.  The author was able to create, in a very short format, excellent characters, story-line and ambiance--far superior than many authors are able to do in 10 times as much space.  The story gripped right away and at no point did the author 'explain' things--she showed things and allowed the story to unfold naturally.  I am just an ordinary reader (who happens to like to give my opinion in reviews) and I can give the perspective that, however she did it, it worked.The secondary story, 'Writers Are Crazy And This Proves It, a short story', was also quite enjoyable.  I suspected it's a tad autobiographical...basically a very unusual take on how a story idea demands attention. Excellent and amusing!The last part is a compilation of book blurbs for her other works.If you are looking to explore a new writer this might be right up your alley...well worth reading on it's own merits and you might find something at the end to appeal to you. I don't mind a few pages at the end of a read showing off the author's other works, in fact I consider that a service...in this case the two stories were so short it felt like the blurbs were a bit much in relation.In any case, I was fortunate enough to pick this up as a freebie, but in terms of reading enjoyment I certainly give it a high recommendation at it's normal price (ninety-nine cents as I edit this review).JTG(I redid/edited this review, my typing sucks and I just noticed it...)

$REVIEW.: I really enjoyed this story.  It was well written and the characters were fascinating.  The only thing missing was the background.  What are Kurjans?  These appear to be more like the mythical vampires.  What war were they fighting?  What happened when the mates were infected with the virus?  And who is Janie?  She seems very sweet and does a lot to humanize Max in the beginning, we get a teaser of her and then she gets mentioned throughout the book.  WHY is she more important than the king?  She's not even the King's daughter or stepdaughter!  Yes, I know there are other books, but a bit more information would have made it perfect... but then again, sometimes when the author repeats the entire storyline, that gets annoying too.  Almost like they cut and paste parts of other books and put them into the current one as filler.But short of missing parts of the story, I really enjoyed the fast pace, the alpha Max and I even liked the heroine, though she seemed to be able to adapt rather quickly...  I might have been a tad more cautious, but then I've probably read too many horror stories to accept things at face value!A good fast read, I think it only took a couple of hours and then suddenly it was done.  Definitely an appetizer for the entire series.  In fact, it made me want to read more by Zanetti.

$REVIEW.: I came across this book having read several of author Thomason's Naval Fighters books. I was so impressed I did an Amazon search for other books he might have authored. I am now even more impressed. Thomason does for naval fighters what Norman Friedman has been doing for navy ships for three decades.This book is very adequately described by its subtitle - "Development of Shipborne Jet Fighters 1943-1962". The dates correspond to the contract for the Navy's first jet fighter, the McDonnell XFD-1 Phantom to the first deployment of the McDonnell F4H-1 (later F-4B) Phantom II.Jet propulsion was what a later generation would describe as a paradigm shift. Virtually overnight the Navy found itself having to learn once again how to operate increasingly sophisticated aircraft at sea. The innovations were coming thick and fast - jet engines, tricycle landing gear, ejection seats, cockpit pressurization, swept wings, guided missiles, etc. Thomason aptly quotes the Red Queen from Alice in Wonderland - "It takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place". Thomason superbly describes the technical, strategic, tactical, industrial, and political contexts under which fighter development took place in this period.Faults are very few and one really has to dig deep to find something to complain about. I came up with no coverage of the XFY-1 and XFV-1 tail sitters but no doubt they were excluded on the grounds of being turboprops, not jets. Still, the Ryan FR and Curtiss XF15C were mentioned (and dismissed) so a paragraph or two would have been nice for completeness sake.But that is really reaching for something to criticize. This is a superb book in every respect; it is well written, well illustrated, and well organized. Very highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: Jeff Ryan's "Super Mario" stands amongst a field of several other excellent expositions on video games.  He chooses to focus his vision almost singularly on Nintendo, but broadens the scope to add additional perspectives when appropriate.  In general, the writing, pace and vision of the book are on par.  But, as the saying goes, "the devil is in the details" and such is the case here.  True gamers and devoted enthusiasts will likely become irked with the author's careless description of our sacred cultural artifacts-- Bowser is not the end boss in Super Mario 2!Within moments (or pages) it becomes questionable how much of a gamer Ryan really is.  Then, he confirms what I began to sniff out early on... he's not so much a gamer (he hasn't played since he was a kid) but a journalist who was hired to write about games.  Oh... makes sense now.  This is not to say that "non-gamers" can't or shouldn't write great books about games.  But, if you are going to tread down that road you have to make sure your research is impeccable and recruit a few die-hards to steer you away from missteps.  Otherwise, you run the risk of being pinned a poseur and having your work spurned.Inaccuracies aside, there's a lot of "glossing over" when it comes to Nintendo's history, trials and failures.  It's as if he used a warp zone or a whistle to bypass the arduous task of researching the leaders and personalities that shape Nintendo's culture.  Instead, we hear over and over how brilliant Miyamoto saved the day again and again.  I love Miyamoto and agree that he's one of the most brilliant and innovative minds of the modern era.  But, just as there is more to Apple than Steve Jobs, there is more to Nintendo than Miyamoto.  There's drama, power struggles, investors, and a slew of different personalities under the icing of this story whose voices are silent.My final grievance with the book would be its slapdash dive into the natural evolution of the video game.  In the final chapters, the author presumes to wax on for some time, in very general terms, as to how games must (and will) find a way to merge the two distinct groups of gamers: core and casual. He suggests quite plainly that casual and core gamers are at "war" and predicts a "unified era" populated with games that simultaneously make both groups happy.  He goes a step further to predict that it will be Miyamoto (and Nintendo) who will rein in this new era.  As a journalist merely re-telling the story of Nintendo without the benefit of decades of personal involvement in video game culture, I felt that he was just spouting rhetoric at this point.  He would have been better served to conclude the book with a simple status update: what Nintendo is doing today, who's running the company and who's designing games.  I would rate the book a 7 out of 10 overall.  Recommended for non-gamers.So, you want to read about Nintendo, video games, Easter eggs and devilish details? Check these out (in my order of preference):-Console Wars by Blake Harris-Game Over by David Sheff-Extra Lives by Tom BissellAudiobook Note: The audiobook was satisfactory, but certainly not the best narration I have listened to.  The narrator doesn't exude much enthusiasm or vitality about the subject and frequently mispronounces game titles and company names.  I would rate the audiobook a 6 out of 10 overall.

$review_text.: It's very difficult writing a snappy review about a book that can help transform your life, particularly when every other review says about the same thing and I'd love to give you something different to consider when debating whether you should buy this book.I agree with the other review that says this book isn't for sissies.  So, who is this book for?  People who are looking for a how-to manual on becoming more present to themselves (and the world), people who are open-minded and even eager to learn more about what's really going on inside themselves, people who are committed to taking the necessary time and attention for transformation, people who are ready to change.What will those people find and experience?  Lots of text that lays out simple yet profound concepts and a 10-week experiential process to follow that moves the readers more deeply into themselves.  The author recommends repeating this 10-week process 2 times, and I highly agree - more will be revealed and felt with the repetition.  Readers who follow the process (morning and evening breathing sessions lasting 15 minutes each, reading a handful of pages each day, and affirming a conscious response as often as remembered) will find that they "get better at feeling" rather than insisting they feel better, as the author frequently asserts is the goal.What might they dislike?  Frequent repetition, but they will likely get something different and deeper with each round.  Plays on words - most of which I found annoying (such as "blame" tied to "be-lame") and some mildly useful (such as "emotion" tied to "energy in motion.")What might they like?  A more tangible way to find stillness (read: easier way to meditate), a manageable and concrete process to increase present moment awareness, an approach that is extremely flexible for the various levels of readers' readiness, a dramatic increase in compassion, understanding, and peace.Finally, if you believe in intuition or the Universe giving you nudges to support you on your path - buy this book!  You will be amazed at how the Universe will support your growth as you move through this process.  Stay with it - you will get better at feeling.  You will find peace.Namaste.

$review_text.: Loved this book! I was quite concerned about what could, should, and would happen to the two characters we learned to love in the first and second books, and wondered if they would stay together or not -  things were set up, it seemed, so it could go either way (or even some other way altogether!).I really enjoyed this whole series. It never occured to me to think of these books as "Amish fiction" or "Christian fiction" until I saw such terms used in other reviews - to me, they are simply really good stories!  And without giving anything away (yet), I'll just say that I think this third instalment is the best of the three; it's very well-crafted, everything gets dealt with and followed through, and there are plot twists and surprises to keep you in suspense, with no idea what will happen. However, no one's character changes suddenly, as I've seen happen in other books, in order to make a plot fit. Things wrap up in such a way that you feel it's right and for the best, and that's for sure and certain, si?!Amanda is back on her parents' farm, helping out now that her father is physically unable to work. Alejandro has hired a local man (I think he is Mennonite? rather than Amish) to help. Is he the type of man Amanda could end up with if things don't work out with Alejandro? He's not quite Plain, but close enough - and steady and reliable, protective of her, and interested in working on the land, not gallivanting around the world in the fast life Alejandro has chosen. He's just modern enough to fit with her new sensibilities (he drives a car rather than a buggy, for example), yet is still religious and home-oriented.Alejandro is on the road again, and he is missing Amanda - indeed, he keeps trying to make her join him. He's provided a nurse for her father, as well as the hired hand, but she just won't leave her parents' place. Is Alejandro a bit too demanding and domineering? Is his machismo coming out - when they are together, sometimes he is a bit physically forceful. Or - is Viper really in love?It doesn't help that communication between the two of them is difficult at best - although Amanda has a cell phone, she is often away from it, working outside on the farm, when he is able to call her; and he is often either performing - or partying - when she is able to call. And, away from her, Alejandro seems to be getting drawn back into the partying lifestyle he once enjoyed so much, going along with fellow performers to late-night after-parties and events. Factor in his manager, who never approved of the marriage in the first place, plus some partying friends and an ex-lover, and there is definitely trouble brewing. Even the unworldly Amish see the covers of gossip magazines in the local grocery stores. And how big a force is Alejandro's mother? At the Thanksgiving dinner, she hints darkly about something in his past that seems to indicate a major flaw in his character; and then, she shows up near the end with an ultimatum. What will he do?SPOILER ALERTS: Do not read this paragraph if you have not yet finished this third book: These are just some thoughts about a couple of plot lines.When Viper was "forced" to pose with models in Amish-type outfits for that ad, I didn't quite buy that he would give in so easily. He did protest strongly at first - for which I admired him - but then he gave in when shown that the contract he'd signed without reading stated that Amish props could be used. I would have thought that his "star power" was a bit stronger, so that his opposition would have been more influential - that they would have feared his breaking the contract more than he would have feared being sued. And when the photos of him and Maria came out, I thought he would have twigged as to how they must have been taken - or at least wondered about it. I also thought he'd go to Lititz sooner than he did, to have the "make or break" conversation with Amanda. But these are minor quibbles, and in fact helped keep me in complete suspense as to what would happen - and hating to put the book down!  The ending was so well handled that as I put my Kindle down I said to my husband, "That book was GREAT! I loved it! It was so well done!" What's it about, he asked. "Well, this Amish girl who falls for this rock star....." His eyes glazed over, but I was on a Reader's High for a while, feeling that joy from a story perfectly told (and now hoping there will be a Book Four!)

Good enough that I looked to see if there was a sequel. My favorite author o the genre is Madeline Sheehan, if you like her, you will most likely enjoy this.

 It is easy to use, and I admit I get a little baffled by user manuals
 So, on recommendation from a friend, I picked up this book.It's very helpful


 It covers multiple kindle products, and the instructions are clear, short, and written in a language I can easily understand.I knew that the paperwhite could do a whole lot of different things, and I was able to walk through them one-by-one with the book and explore them all
 I especially like the paperwhite text to speech function that allows me to listen while I drive


 I also like the instructions on how to convert .pdf's to a readable format in the kindle paperwhite.I think this book would be helpful also for someone who is trying to decide which kindle product to get as there is a nice comparison.

$review_text.: This well balanced book chronicles the events leading up to and including the Soviet invasion of Finland in 1939-40.  Like many I have often heard references to the gallent stand the Finns made against the massive Soviet efforts to conquer them.  The scarcity of materials available in print often restricted any further interest.  Upon viewing the amazing Finnish movie "The Winter War" I became once again interested in learning more about this topic.This book does the subject much justice.  While the author's sympathies are certainly with the Finns, he does not allow this to bias his opinion toward the actions of Stalin and the Soviets in general.  There are few more inspiring examples of a small nation fighting heroically against a big nation.  The determined stand the Finns made on the Mannerheim Line for 70 days surely rivals that of the Spartans at Thermopolaye 480 BC.  The author shows us that only the Finnish army was capable of such a feat at that moment in history.  Uniquely adapted to their frozen environment, the Finnish soldier was flexible, heroic, and a deadly fighter.  Trotter believes that in their own country, fighting on the defense, the Finnish army was probably the best there was at that time.  The army prided itself on a no-nonesense approach toward war, and had been schooled for years in making the most of their meager resources in a limited economy.  The Soviets in contrast were a newly created force from the days of the Revolution in Russia. While lavishly equipped, the army was untried in a conventional war.  The Stalinst purges all through the 1930s had empitied the competent officer class, leaving the army under the leadership of party thugs and incompetents.  The contrast between the heavy, crude doctrines of the Soviets as opposed to the light, nimble Finns is striking.  The reader will find numerous examples of Finnish platoons and companies decimating entire Russian battalions and regiments.  When it comes to the blow by blow account of the actual campaign Trotter engages the reader with an exciting and detailed narrative.  Again, while his passion is certainly with the embattled Finns, praise is also given to the often suicidal bravery of the Russian soldiers who were thrown away by the thousands in mass attacks against fixed positions.In the end the Finns must submit to the enivitable as the Soviets finally get their act together and begin to apply concerted pressure all along the front.  The Mannerheim line holds out for 70 days, but must fall eventually to coordinated, massive Soviet assaults.  Finland is forced to accept Stalin's peace, requiring the loss of extensive border territories near Leningrad and elsewhere.  Had the Finns not fought they might have gott'en more modest pre-war demands, but there was no assurance that this would have been all that Stalin wanted.  By fighting Finland showed the world that a nation of 3 million could stand up to over 170 million Russians!  The sacrefice of nearly 70,000 men enabled the Finns to retain their indepedence, even if compromised.  Russian losses will probably never been known but must easily exceed 250,000. Trotter discusses the subsequent alliance with Nazi Germany which was controversial for the Finns.  Readers will find this an excellent and exciting work on a little known aspect of the Second World War.  Highly recommended.

$review_text.: Within the first two pages, I knew I was going to enjoy reading The Latecomers Fan Club
Mulligan writes with such a clean, easy style that slipping into the lives of Abby, Nathaniel and Maggie is effortless from the off.The actual storyline is a complex web of emotions, stemming from unfulfilled lives and stagnant potential

As the three main characters' lives intertwine, they initially begin to bring each other down; Maggie is a divorcee lost soul, searching for her own path after moving in, marrying and becoming dependent on Andrew in quick succession
She reflects single, childless women in their 30s everywhere, who feel their lives are failure


Abby, on the other hand, is desperately clawing to keep hold of her toxic relationship, even though she comes across as more level headed


She is at first nave, knowing what she wants but unable to make it happen


Nathaniel 







well, I didn't like him much

He's self-involved, self-pitying, and entirely selfish is about his sum

Damaged by his relationship with his father, Nathaniel wanders around uninterested and unfulfilled by his job, `girlfriend' and life in general, too much of a coward to do what he should have done a long time ago


His only redeeming feature is his desire to be a father.A year in the lives of this trio results in some heartfelt realisations and as Mulligan documents each feeling behind the characters' actions with such finesse, you're left wondering if the author felt every single emotion as she wrote
A fantastic read.Reviewed by Charlotte Foreman on behalf of BestChickLit.com.

$review_text.: This is a book which continues in the same vein (get it? Vein, vampires? Hardy har har) as the original Dracula, both in its storytelling method (through diary entries and letters) and in many of the characters. However, it falls short of the original in its pacing, which is erratic, and story, which can't seem to make up its mind (is it a romance? Is it horror? Is it a thrilling action-adventure? It could be all of those, if the story were more cohesive). Character development is pretty shallow, and the plot seemed somewhat contrived. It's not a terrible book, but it could've been so much more. However, to be fair, I'm not in the target age range, seeing as I'm an adult (although I use that term loosely). I believe this book and series was written more for a young-adult audience, so perhaps I'm judging it too harshly. I'll put it this way: Even though I have no interest in reading other books in this series, I wouldn't go so far as to say this book is as atrocious as Twilight.

If you haven't read them ( Mayfair series, or the killing Sarai series, edge of never)  I HIGHLY recommend them. I couldn't really get into this one because I felt the plot wasn't strong enough and I didn't like the characters. **spoiler alert** The characters seemed immature for the age they were supposed to be and I do not feel like it accurately portrayed someone with bipolar/depression.  I also didn't like how Brayelle's suicide attempt was blamed on the medication that was supposed to help her, but her drug use was never considered a factor towards her suicide attempts.  It is well known the highs and lows of drug use will worsen depression.  I will continue to read from this author although this one wasn't a favorite.

In this book set you meet Maddie & Boone, Mitch & Perrie & Dev & Lacy who are all family even if they don't know it at first. It's all about family and how tragedy can rip a family to shreds, and in sickness & death bring everyone back together. It's an incredible saga that the author brings to life with a very down to earth family. The story is incredible and the characters are amazing and really bring the everyday life to the table and suck's you in. I loved reading this series and can't wait to meet the rest of the family in the next two series. I urge you to read this series because it will make you laugh, cry and cum a lot. Enjoy reading!!

 A place where inanimate objects come alive, where animals are intelligent and where childhood characters take on a darker, more realistic interpretation


 A gruesome war is being waged by the mysterious Hollow Man interlaced with anterior motives that hit a little too close to home.The underlying political themes make for a fascinating read


 This, coupled with the insanity that ensues, keeps things interesting while the narrative flips back and forth between Gene Speilman and Aurora Jones

$review_text.: 3.5 stars.This is the first in the Desire Series in Regency England.  The story begins with the Countess of Worthington, Lily St. Auben, out in the middle of the night in her nightgown looking over a cliff at her dead husband.  She is running away through the night and in labor when she is "rescued" by the 8th Duke of Westlake, Arthur.  Lily is only 18 and had been forced into marriage at 15 by an uncaring guardian, her uncle.  She is abused by her husband and spends a horrible 3 years with her husband before his death.  Eventhough Lily is only 18, I still found her to be immature for her age and very weak.  I also had a problem with the duke and his inability to communicate.  Can't you just talk to each other?  They also mentioned that Lily found the duke to be two different people, but it was never really explained in a logical manner.  Otherwise, an interesting historical romance.

$review_text.: This is a very good account of the fleeing to Argentina but readers should keep in mind that this was only one country who offered a safe haven to war criminals


The Real Odessa chronicles how Per&oacute;n's government brought Nazi war criminals to Argentina yet ignores the other countries who did the very same thing for a wide variety of reasons

The five primary hiding places were Syria, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and..

ta-da! --the United States

Some countries did it for pay, the United States for intelligence information


In either case, murderers were knowingly set free among citizens of five nations.

$REVIEW.: I loved The Temptation!  Dean and Jillian's relationship continues to grow in trust and intimacy as they explore their boundaries and fantasies
 It was interesting to see both reacted when fantasy became reality and the reality wasn't quite what Dean had anticipated
 I was left wanting more and I can't wait to see what proposition he has for Jillian in the next installment!

$REVIEW.: I wrote a lengthier review that disappeared, so here's an abbreviated one:Titan Books and Henry Mendryk really (who did the fantastic color reproduction) really outdid themselves with this beautiful tome. All of these varied S&K; classics are in a large-size format, so you get to really examine the artwork. The color reproduction is flat out fantastic. The colors are obviously brighter than they would have been on the old newsprint printings when they were first published, but they are not garishly bright. Mendryk really put a lot of care into preserving the energy of the colors without making the pages look like they were done with the fancy digital coloring of the modern day. Even color bleeds are kept in. That is something I think could have been discarded, with the color bleeds fixed, but I respect the decision.The benday dots are visible, which helps to bring that old-comic feel to each page. I haven't read any of the text pieces yet, but given the quality of the contributors and the quality of the book itself, I'm sure they are top-notch.On the copyright page Titan has a list of upcoming/coming soon books in the S&K; library, and they will make you drool, let me tell you.This is a worthy initial entry in the great feat of re-presenting Simon and Kirby works that have rarely been seen since their initial printings. I was particular tickled to see Stuntman in full color, which I have never seen before other than a few scans of the original stories.If you are a fan of the golden age, of Kirby and/or Joe Simon, of power-packed storytelling in all the known genres, or even a casual comic historian, I urge you to buy this book!
$review_summary.: Golden age fans, Simon/Kirby fans, art fans: BUY THIS BOOK!

$review_text.: Before I criticize this book, allow me to say that the first in its series (City of Masks) was superb, and the second (Land of Echoes) was also very good.  It is precisely the type of atmospheric terror in those books that is, sadly, what is lacking in this one.  There are too many subplots, and they mostly pedestrian.  Daniel Hecht is a talented writer, and I usually really enjoy his novels: but the "talent" of Cree Black is not utilized at all in this book.  You don't get supernatural, and you don't get romance - just big doses of history and science.

$review_text.: ~~~I received an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review for my blog Nerd Alert Book Love~~~I just don&#8217;t know where to start. This book was all over the place, but in a really good way! This is one of the reasons I read. This book is an absolute gem that deserves to be on everyone&#8217;s TBR. This book is follows the lives of 5 teenagers, who all become connected to each other because of one tiny town called Hope&#8217;s Grove, Oklahoma.  There is a storm brewing that none of them will be ready for.In this book we meet Kyle Mason, the football hero, who is getting ready to go off to college to play football for Oklahoma State University. After and unfortunate turn of events, he now finds himself the &#8216;man&#8217; of the family. He has to now juggle going to Stillwater for summer football practice during the week and coming home on weekends to help his mom and sister, Ella Jane run their landscaping business and do a job for a rich family in Summit Bluffs.Enter Ella Jane, Kyle&#8217;s innocent and gorgeous younger sister. She is devastated by the event that happens in her family and has lost some faith in men. She feels alone because her best friend is moving and her brother is going off to college, despite all of that her mom needs her now more than ever. She also has the biggest crush on her brother&#8217;s best friend Coop, or Brantley Cooper.Brantley Cooper, or Coop as he is referred to by everyone is Kyle&#8217;s best friend and he secretly loves Ella Jane. He&#8217;s ready to make his move on her since Kyle is getting ready to move away for school. Coop is the epitome of loyal and doesn&#8217;t want to mess up with his friendship with Kyle by putting the moves on Ella Jane. So he takes things very slow and they have a beautiful moment that is interrupted by his own guilty feelings.Meanwhile, in the next town Summit Bluffs&#8230;Cameron Michelson is your typical mean girl. Filthy rich and all set to go on a tropical vacation with her mom. She breaks up with her &#8216;boyfriend&#8217; Hayden so that they can each have &#8216;free&#8217; summers before they start their senior years. She gets some unexpected news and now has to spend the summer in Summit Bluffs. Now she must stay home and make sure the landscaper is doing his job.Rich boy Hayden Prescott is your typical bad boy. He doesn&#8217;t care about the consequences of his actions and does whatever he wants. His parents finally get fed up with him and send him to Hope&#8217;s Grove to live with his grandparents for a summer of hard work with Mason Landscaping Service. He is devastated until he meets Ella Jane.I really enjoyed this story. I was one of my favorite reads of this year. I know some people don&#8217;t like love triangles, but I don&#8217;t mind them at all. The Ella Jane, Coop and Hayden triangle will have you screaming at your E-reader! I know I was! There were so many beautiful scenes and the making of two great love stories. All of the characters are well developed and the book has lots of substance but you will want to read it all.No skimming here.The &#8216;Storm Warnings&#8217; that we read in the book are perfect forecasts of what is to come. The last few chapters had me GLUED TO THE BOOK!!!! This is brilliantly written book, but I must warn you&#8230;.HOLY CLIFFANGER CENTRAL BATMAN! Who..what&#8230;how..when&#8230;where&#8230;crickets..Despite this devastating cliffhanger, this book gets a certified Nerd Alert A+!

$review_text.: Review for Fit to be Tied: The Last Good Knight IV by Tiffany ReiszFit to be Tied is the fourth installment in The Last Good Knight series by Tiffany Reisz and my favorite so far&#8230; If you haven&#8217;t read the first three in this series you MUST go read them first&#8230; if you don&#8217;t you&#8217;re seriously short changing yourself the full experience of this incredible series. I have to say Tiffany Reisz is probably one of my new favorite BDSM authors. I now will go back and devour the rest of her books starting with book one of The Original Sinners. (Totally kicking my own butt for not having already read these! Bad book whore!!)So, this one starts off with good news, the Domme attacker is caught and Nora no longer requires the use of a bodyguard. Guess what that means? It&#8217;s time to get it on! (Que clich&eacute; porn bowchicawowow music here) I was wrong in my earlier assessment of the first book having the hottest BDSM scene I had ever got my hands on&#8230; When Lance submits to his Mistress in Fit to be Tied I swear Victoria Secret doesn&#8217;t sell enough panties to keep me in dry ones while reading it! It&#8217;s that freaking hot.Lance is like the perfect balance between strong alpha man and submissive Mistress pleaser. I won&#8217;t go into the nitty gritty details here, but let&#8217;s just say if this doesn&#8217;t get your motor revving.. you should probably seek medical help because you have something going on down in your pants and it&#8217;s NOT happy. Ha!I give Fit to be Tied FIVE stars for storyline as it flawlessly continues where the previous books left off and builds upon what we already know. And FIVE PLUS drenched panties for some super sexy tiedtothebed-caned-flogged-humped-andthensome smut.  A certified Mommy&#8217;s a Book Whore MUST READ NOW!Review by the Head Whore.

$REVIEW.: `The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter' like `Love Songs from the Man'ysh' has also been illustrated by the highly talented Miyata Masayuki. Though there were not enough pictures in `The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter' which is a pity as it would have been an excellent opportunity for Miyata to display his talent.As for the story itself well, it's certainly different from most fairy tales in that the heroine is in many ways a villain, the only other similar character would be Princess Turandot... Aside from that it is not an especially interesting story.

$review_text.: It's too bad this book abruptly ends in the middle of season six. Although the last season and a half was far from the show's best period, there were still some good episodes scattered in there, and it just seems annoyingly  incomplete. The publisher should really issue a revised edition, although  now that the show has ended that seems unlikely. But it's great having a  resource like this w/ details about each episode, each season, the  characters and actors, etc. The Court-TV website borrows shamelessly from  this book for the episode summaries. &quot;Homicide&quot; is simply a  fabulous show, and once you start watching it, you just want to know  everything about it. This book, while it isn't perfect, contains a lot of  information that wouldn't be easily accessible elsewhere, and is highly  recommended for the show's fanatical fans for that reason.

$REVIEW.: What do Lenny Kravitz, Craig David, Derek Jeter, Hale Berry, Barak Obama, Rain Pryor, Keanu Reeves, and The Rock all have in common? They're successfull bi-racial Americans of politics, arts, and athletics. Unfortunately, Rebecca Walker Leventhal doesn't measure up. She feels sorry for herself because she's half-white, and she's angry at her father for making her half-Jewish. Poor thing.Leventhal's life is nowhere near as bad as she wants us to believe. Her father cared about her very much, and her stepmom sounds okay to me, but she writes about her father like he was neglectful. She's angry at him for moving the family to a suburb, but was that such a bad thing? What's wrong with wanting to live in a good area with great schools? She felt alienated from her white Jewish friends, but that was self-imposed. All these Jewish people WANTED to be her friend, but the suburbs just weren't good enough for her.Her next complaint is her teen years. She acts like it was all pain and guilt, but from what I read, she had a great time. She had lots of interesting boyfriends, and spent a summer on the set of "The Color Purple." She graduated from high school, went to an Ivy League college, and that doesn't sound bad.Walker's problem is her MOTHER. Alice Walker was a terrible parent. What kind of mother refuses to take her daugher to meet her principal? What kind of mother refuses to be involved in her daughter's life. I think the reason  she complains so much is that she's realy angry at her mother, but seems guilty accusing her. After all, Alice Walker is black, and she can't accuse her black mother of anything. Her Jewish father is an easier target.Leventhal (or Walker, whatever she calls herself) should stop thinking of herself as a victim and a mutant, and start thinking of herself as the product of two wonderful things. Lenny Kravitz  was another Black Jewish American, and he had his lumps, including his parents' divorce. But being Black and Jewish didn't hold him back, it kept him going. Rain Pryor was a Black jew, and her dad was a cokehead, but she writes about her life with strength and humor.At first I didn't think Rebecca had the wisdom commonly associated with American Jews. But then I realized she's one of us. How do I know? Her whining! Read "Born to Kvetch" and you'll learn why Jews are stereotyped as whiners. We're very vocal about things, including our problems. It's one of the ways that we avoid stress and anger, which in other cultures leads to drunkness, temper flashes and wife-beating. But we do other things besides complain, and that's all she does. Complain.

$review_text.: Picture Betty Davis or Joan Crawford in their later acting careers as Rachel!Such craziness....the central character, Rachel, seems to start off as a 'normal' young woman, inheriting her aunt's home.  It then proceeds to meander about from Rachel's inflated view of her abilities and beauty, to her judgement of appearances and unrealistic expectations.It might be said that we have all encountered a bit of Rachel.  Very often thru our own self doubt or coming of age we may have provided our own selves with false allusions.Too often and painfully, however, we all encounter a larger part of 'Rachel' in a crazy aunt, cousin, friend, neighbor...Stephen Benatar can be commended for writing in the voice of a woman, a crazy one at that.I personally found the book to be disturbing.  Cannot say I could recommend it to anyone.  Didn't really care about the outcome of the characters.It has been speculated.....were these characters real in Rachel's life? were some or any of them real?...certainly this could prompt someone to read "Wish her safe at home."After getting thru this book, I am looking forward to a sane novel, good characters and an interesting plot.This novel IS BIZARRE!As I reread this review...it is almost as if Rachel is here!

It is broken down into three seperate books that occur at the same time but seperately in the book
Although the one story gets very paranormal (warewolves), it was still enjoyable to read
The scenes were hot (if you enjoy BDSM, which I would assume you are into if you are reading anything about Doms)
Although the individual stories were short, they did not lack on description


I enjoyed and would recommend.

$review_text.: Before reading The Tao of Kenny Loggins I knew very little about the life of this American icon aside from the peppy lyrics of his song Footloose, but Dennis Waller's research has given me much insight into this famous musician

Waller's passion and understanding of the practice of Tao gives him much credibility on the subject
He has authored many other books on spirituality and Eastern religion and clearly enjoys sharing the wisdom he has gained through his life experiences.He begins this book by giving a brief explanation of the practice of Tao (pronounced more like `dowel' for those of us who are unfamiliar.) This was very helpful as, previous to reading this, I had very little knowledge on the subject

Having this basic information up front made it easier to grasp the concepts conveyed throughout the rest of the book

He sums it up in this way, "The fundamentals of the Tao are simple, we are all connected, love is the key."Whether you agree with the beliefs of Tao or not, this book is interesting to read


I found it to be very informational and also noticed several things that I do agree with
Once such idea I can fully support is that "one of the points of living a spiritual nature is we no longer live the life that is expected of us by others and we no longer require people to be someone they are not." This seems to be the theme of Kenny Loggins' life.I was also surprised, and absolutely delighted, to discover what a beautiful writer Kenny Loggins is

Wallace includes many pieces of Loggins' writing and when I reached those parts I would linger and enjoy each word
These quotes of Loggins, combined with Wallace's commentary, form a clear description of a complex subject.One of my favorite parts of this book was a section where Wallace takes many lyrics of Kenny Loggins' popular songs and explains the meaning behind them


It was a brilliant way to further explain the heart behind this passionate artist.I would suggest this book to anyone wanting to either know more about the life of Kenny Loggins or learn about the practice of Tao

Good job, Mr


Wallace, on your hard work.

$review_text.: I rated this 4.5 stars overall!!Helen creates a world of fantasy where very powerful vampires roam the world. This is the first book in a 3 part series. Blake is an elder vampire and he falls for Siohban immediately while she is vacationing in the Southern France. Blake slips away from her in order to protect the love of his life, but he has never forgotten her and a chance meeting brings them back together. Once everything is perfect, Siohban is kidnaped and used as a sex slave. I don't want to give too much away, so you will just have to discover this world of vampires that Helen has created on your own.Helen's story is full of imagery that makes you feel as though you are right there in the story. I felt as though I was sucked into this story right from the beginning. Her characters are well thought out right down to the exact item of clothing they are wearing and the steam factor is through the roof in this book. If you love a book chalked full of hot and wild sex scenes, then this is definitely a book you will enjoy. Be forewarned though, there is a cliff hanger at the end of book one. It's not a devastating one, but you will want to pick up book two right away. I have grown fond of Helen's style and am definitely looking forward to reading more from her in the future.

$REVIEW.: I enjoyed reading this book, found myself absorbed in the emotions involving these ancient Egyptian Gods. I found myself having mixed feeling about Osiris...his treatment of Isis before his death at the hands of Seth was reprehensible. He was a philanderer, he slept with other women and didn't truly love Isis in the way she deserved. Even after Isis brings him back from the dead he is still selfish. His missing part is his only real focus until he is struck with a curse that makes him really think how he has treated the woman he loves. He journeys with her and a small band of priestess to find the missing part of him and truths between them and the constant battles with Seth nearly drive them apart forever. There are explicit scenes that are sexual in nature and constant references to Osiris`s male member. If that bothers you then I suggest you read something else. Otherwise, this is a nice romantic story that will leave you smiling.

$REVIEW.: First things first: 25 chapters with the last one being more of an epilogue since it fast forwards a year

Approx 3000 locations, but I'm not sure how that is possible since other ebooks that have that many locations are a lot shorter


This book is about the same length as the others in the Home Series
If you can stand the wait then you might want to see if the price drops soon
I didn't really want to spend $6.99, but I couldn't stand to wait for the price to lower.Character connections: if you have read the series, you know Ben is Noah's brother and Clark's old friend and roommate from Home Again

Micah is the guy who David was talking about selling a fix-me-upper to in Love At First Sight.Zach and Aaron from He Completes Me have a couple of cameo appearances
David has a cameo


Seth and Eli who have appeared in other books in the series are seen again


 Andrew, the tattooed doctor we met in Love at First Sight has a brief cameo

And of course, Noah and Clark and the Formans are around too


There is a reference to a Bert and Ernie (who I now know are Andrew & Caleb from the recently published The One Who Saves Me) I originally thought it was Nate & Jake because of the Bert & Ernie cake on the cover of Where He Ends and I Begin.This book goes back to a first person POV and it is Ben's we hear
The main premise of Just What the Truth Is is Ben coming to terms with being gay

There's just one little thing
Micah just assumes Ben is gay and out and begins a relationship with him
Ben's mind is at war with his heart


He feels happy for the first time in his life, but his parents and some preconceived notions about a gay lifestyle make him question everything


And Ben has a chronic case of "speaking before he thinks"' and Micah is at the stage in his life where he isn't gonna chase after someone


You have to read it to find out if Ben & Micah have a HEA...The next book is entitled The One Who Saves Me.

$REVIEW.: A little slice of horror. When Mike and his wife Emma go on a camping holiday in an effort to rekindle their marriage, their time away is fraught with unexpected difficulties. When their son goes missing during a severe thunderstorm, little do they know what is in store for them.This novella has elements of psychological horror as well. It's well written and quite comprehensive for the length of the story. Mike and Emma present as well fleshed out characters. Dark and atmospheric. Well worth a look at.

$REVIEW.: This is the first Old West romance I've read, and I picked a good one to start with! Movies set in Tombstone always entertained me, so the cover of Miralee Ferrell's novel attracted me right away. Then, not only did she write an entertaining story with characters I grew to love, she included author's notes that connect the story with her research of the real history of Tombstone.

$REVIEW.: A predictable story that was too sweet for my taste. Everything was just a tad too perfect. And the sex scenes, talk about repetitive, which then of course became boring. I would have given the book three stars, but the whole "kidney" issue was a little far-fetched to say the least. We're to believe Korinne's kidney is a match to her husband's, Galen, just because they have the same blood type? Seriously? Wouldn't there have been a better chance of a match with his brother, Brady? But no, we're told Brady wasn't a match even though he never took the blood test. In fact, he didn't even offer to be tested to see if he'd be a match. As to the cute and whimsical nicknames Korinne and Jenna had for each other since college and still referred to, "Ducky" and "Twink," really got on my nerves; thought it ridiculous and a little childish. In the end, nothing special. Considering it's listed for $0.99 on Amazon, give it a try. Just because I didn't like it doesn't mean you won't.

But what I did not like about the book was the constant hitting herself over the head because if her weight, and not believing that a fit and handsome fella would not want her.  Heck do something to change your disposition, not just sit and wallow in self hatred. If the author would have made her character mentally stronger I would have liked this book better.

$review_text.: Paul and Marie, two French children, live in a small village in the French Free Zone during World War II.  Their father is being held by the Germans, and they worry about his whereabouts and his welfare throughout the book. In addition, they are extremely worried about their Jewish friend, Henri, whose parents go missing suddenly and mysteriously. While trying to hide him, they are recruited into the French Resistance movement. They bond with Resistance members and experience human personality quirks they might not have been exposed to had the times been normal. Even in the Resistance there is bravery, and at the same time there is pettiness. The story contains suspense, secret codes, and elements of spy stories, as our protagonists work on tricking the German occupiers.  Throughout this graphic novel, Paul's sepia-toned drawings are interspersed with the illustrator's color illustrations. His pictures form a visual thread that readers can use to follow the action. A two-page Author's Note explains the French Resistance and contains an overview of free and occupied France during World War II. This book is the first volume of a projected trilogy. Grades 7 and up.  Shelly Feit

$REVIEW.: This is one of my best reads in years. It's one of those while you're reading it you go back and reread parts because they're that good.When Everett was a criminal he was one of the top guys. But he retired from the criminal life to devote himself to his wife and child and the world they've created far from the mean streets. It will take him longer to retire his inner convict and become fully human. But he's pulled back in when his past shows up to extort him into doing one last job: neo-Nazis want him to use his particular set of skills to recover stolen Nazi gold. This means leaving his world to return to the mean streets and taking on a cult leader running a commune of street people.Everett is the coldest ex-con badass since Andrew Vachss' Burke. Everett moves through the gutters of the mean streets, picking up a homicidal boy wonder for a sidekick, dealing with everything from bottom-feeding amateurs to pros who are his equal for deadliness. There isn't a scene that is less than compelling. None of the characters are forgettable after you read them. There are scenes from Everett's childhood that are amazing, the events that made him the way he is. This is both a textbook on what makes a badass and the study of a man discovering the scale of his damage and the humanity just beyond his reach. Of the many cool things about this novel the coolest is watching his reach get closer to it.

$REVIEW.: Long fascinated by Russia's vastness, extremes of climate, tumultuous history and nuclear arsenal, Jeffrey Tayler quit his stultifying Peace Corps job in Tashkent in 1993 to get to know the country by traveling "the entire landmass of the former Soviet Union", a journey of 8,325 miles, from Magadan, Siberia, to Warsaw, Poland.With Tayler's survival sometimes in doubt and his progress often in peril (from bureaucrats as much as terrain), its tempting to flip to the end of his account, "Siberian Dawn," to make sure that he did, in fact, succeed.Few armchair travelers will envy Tayler his harrowing trip - across Siberia, through the Urals, into the Black Earth zone and over the Ukraine border - but his stubborn approach, open friendliness and occasional lapses of temper make him a stimulating guide to a land of grandeur, chaos and tragedy.The bleakest of the bleak is the frozen Far East, Siberia. Populated by the descendants of prisoners and a few others lured by high salaries in the `60s, now evaporated, none can afford to leave. Indeed, it seems, when Tayler arrives by air at his starting point, Magadan, that air is the only way out. Road travel, he is told, is not possible. At last a friendly inhabitant admits, "It's not impossible. Sometimes trucks go to Ust-Nera. But who wants to go there? When you leave you will fly out."Tayler sticks to his plan and hitches a ride on one of the trucks taking a route "passable only when frozen." The driver immediately wants to know, " `What drives an American from the comforts of the U.S. to Magadan? This doesn't seem normal to me. And frankly, I wonder if an American can handle the toughness of it.' "But Tayler, speaking Russian like a native, or at least like "a Soviet citizen from one of the Baltic Republics," maintains his determination and confidence. Siberia, a land of riches and perils, is sparsely dotted with enclaves of dour, defeated Russians, maintained on vodka and bad food. They mix not at all with the native ethnic peoples who seem to Tayler no better off.But Tayler speaks to everyone he meets, even makes friends. He gathers the history of places (most hark back to Stalin) and notes the old people's nostalgia for Stalin's strong arm, the young people's sullen defeatism, the general distrust and envy of capitalism. And everywhere the land is blighted by toxic, even radioactive waste.A numbness settles over him, though it is not reflected in his observations or conversations, which remain full of curiosity and sympathy. But Siberia, "a natural prison," seems to have a natural numbing effect on everyone. The weather, the isolation, the history, the bleak landscape, the hopelessness. It's a place that actually breeds bracing theories about the benefits of radioactivity.Not until Lenin's birth place on the Volga does this oppressive feeling lift. "An intoxicating warmth stole over me," Tayler says, wandering the streets of Ulyanovsk. "In some visceral way, I suddenly realized how European Russians are," he writes, reflecting that the Eastern conquered territories "remained places of exile."Some things don't change though. Despite the light and color, the bureaucrats remain surly; martinets drunk with a fistful of power. He is more recognizably American in the West and has to dig his heels in harder not to be fleeced like a tourist. In Siberia it was easy to pass for Soviet; most people had never seen an American and couldn't imagine why one would visit.Wherever he is, Tayler gathers stories; personal tales, strident opinions, sweeping philosophical and historical views. He accepts hospitality wherever it's offered and makes friends, some enduring, as he tells us in an epilogue summing up his last five years residing in Moscow."Siberian Dawn" is moving, fascinating, worrisome. It portrays a vast land plagued by alcoholism and poverty and industrial pollution so profound it will take your breath away - almost literally. Russia seems so mired in its troubles that its literature and the glories of its past sink beneath the awful awareness of its huge, unstable nuclear arsenal. The book ends in Moscow with the October 1993 siege of the Russian parliament - unsuccessful and unable to capture the attention of most Muscovites.A most absorbing book with two flaws - no map (why not??) and no pictures. Though Tayler frequently mentions the photos he took of the people he meets and the places he describes, none are included.

Maxwell is a leadership coach, founder of an organization that has trained some six million persons in numerous countries and the author of 71 books on topics related to leadership

 Sometimes You Win and Sometimes You Learn is his latest effort

Such a prolific writer can succeed only by writing in a non-original, commonsense manner and this book fits that description


It is interesting in the sense that Maxwlll tells a lot of stories about famous and not so famous people, writes in a clear, easy to understand manner and even provides a number of jokes for the reader&#8217;s enjoyment
 But the ideas themselves are well known and the subject of many other self-help books.The main message of the book is that we fail often in life and we have to learn how to benefit from our mistakes
The book largely consist of a series of  aphorisms followed by some personal experiences or stories

The chapter headings give an idea of the routine nature of the content:  Humility: The Spirit of Learning (don&#8217;t be a know-it-all); Responsibility: The First Step of Learning (take responsibility for your mistakes instead of blaming others or the situation); and Adversity: The Catalyst for Learning (when bad things happen to us we are motivated to learn how to get better)
 The book abounds with statements such as the following, &#8220;Adversity opens doors for new opportunities if we want to learn from it.&#8221; (Page 136)Anyone who has read at all on this topic will find it hard to discover new ideas in this book

However if you are looking for an easy-to-understand work on how to deal with failure with lots of examples written in an easy to digest format, this book can be very helpful.

$REVIEW.: Michael is a firefighter and wolf, if he isn't at the station, on a call or patrolling he is working out. Justin is a rare eagle who is a lawyer and shifter negotiator, he is alone and sees the relationships the wolves have and is fascinated. Michael and Justin are strongly attracted, but after sleeping together Michael runs and won't respond to Justin's texts and calls. Michael calls after two weeks, they hook up and...he runs. They are forced together through pack related work and decide to start again. They sleep together...and Michael runs hard. There are things in Michael's past he doesn't talk about but Justin has triggered traumatic memories. His wolf recognises Justin as their mate and that terrifies Michael because Justin can really hurt him. Justin's eagle recognises Michael as their mate and he is being hurt by Michael's behaviour. When Justin is shot in his eagle form things begin to unravel for Michael - how can he let Justin in? How can he not? And will Justin ever talk to him again after Justin's ultimatum which he failed? How do you apologise to your mate? Flowers (check), cleaning the drive of snow and ice (check), leaving a dead rabbit at the door (errrrr?).I have been waiting for this book for ages. I love the story and have been wanting the Michael story since we met him. There are some terrible editing issues here which is so disappointing considering how long we have had to wait for book four. I have taken off a star for that because really, it is distracting when there are missing words and misspellings. For all that I still enjoyed the story and look forward to the next installment...maybe with the Tigers?Note: these are not stand alone books. You will need to have read the series to make sense of what is going on.

Aidan is quite the charmer but of course he would be. It's in his genes.  It also great to read a novel that gives the reader surprises, excitement and love. KR Bankston is articulate and insightful. This story gives real-life experiences. Every one can relate in one form or another.

$review_text.: I loved this book! The summary sounded so fun, and it did not disappoint. Just thinking about it makes me want to read it again. It's perfect if you're in the mood for a light hearted, funny, romantic book!There was a lot more involved with being a breakup artist than I realized. I thought Amelia's friends would ask her to breakup with their boyfriends and she'd break it to the guys like in junior high. I was happily surprised, Amelia got paid by girls to breakup with their boyfriends in a way that kept the boys happy. Let's just say she got to wear lots of cute outfits and changed her hair color often when she was on the job.I love how serious Amelia was about her "work". She had files of each guy she had to breakup with for someone else. She studied up on the guy and practically went undercover. She was like a spy or something. Really fun.David came along and was handsome, fun, smart, caring, what more can I say?Go out and read this book! You'll love it!

$REVIEW.: Prior to reading this, I wasn't really sure what to expect. The cover isn't something that would normally catch my eye, and I'm not very familiar with historical fiction. However, the necromancy concept is one I frequently enjoy exploring, so I decided to give this one a go. As you can see, it worked out well :)I've read a lot of paranormal romance, and I have a heart for gothic fantasy, but I've never read something quite like this before. If you are looking for something original, Larkspur will not disappoint. The key to great fiction is tension, suspense, mystery, and well-drawn characters--all of which Larkspur provides in spades. I like my fiction dark, and V.M. Jaskiernia knows how to deliver. Her approach to necromancy was fresh and alluring, the story was fluid, and I was full immersed in the world V.M. created from the first page.I will definitely consider reading more of her work.

$review_text.: BRIEF SUMMARYPurity is at the end of a 27-day job interview at The Kids' Place
She is hoping to get the position of event coordinator

 She also finds herself Dreaming and thinking about Alex, a board member of The Kids' Place

With a growing attraction to Alex and her relationship with her best friends, Purity has to deal with her ex, Derek who is trying to get her back in his life.THOUGHTSThis story for me was ok, however, I found myself split in the middle with a lot of things
 Though the story seems to be ok, the pace of the story was not to my liking
Purity's character was sweet and Alex seems sweet as well, but their romance for me was not interesting enough throughout most of the book
 The book I felt focused on Purity's friendship with Courtney and Meg with the budding romance between Alex and Purity not far behind
The length of the book is 4105, by 1180, I still felt no real chemistry between Alex and Purity, by that point, I knew more about Purity's friendship with Meg and Courtney and her job

This is book one in the Embracing Love series, and I am all for establishing future characters for the next book, but I think it overshadowed the story between Alex and Purity most of the times.It started to pick up a bit for me personally, with Alex's situation within his personal life and Derek, Purity's crazy ex
 The author also gave us a little story between Meg and Bobby


Bobby is Purity's brother


 While I found this story to be ok, maybe it will be someone's treasure.Story: FAIREnjoyment: FAIRKindle Length: 4105

$REVIEW.: God Distorted: How your Earthly Father Affects your Perception of God and Why it Matters. By John Bishop.&#8220;We live crippled by sin but we should not live disabled by stuff in the past.&#8221; &#8211;God DistortedGod Distorted takes a look at the relationships people have with their fathers and how that correlates with their spirituality. This book uses anecdotal evidence of how this affects not only our spiritual well- being but also our overall success and happiness in life.The author has worked with people from many backgrounds and has even helped inmates find peace through Christianity.  This book is an interesting reads for anyone interested in psychology and spirituality and how they relate. It is a must read for counselors and religious figures.This book explores passive, absent, demanding, enabling controlling and abusive fathers and how it can damage humans to the core. It then discusses how be overcome when the afflicted realize their distress. This text is an easy read, but could be an emotionally difficult hurdle for some readers.

$review_text.: The first RPG I ran was Call of Cthulhu, with the first edition, in 1981.  Horror, especially weird horror, appealed to me as nothing else did, and Call of Cthulhu, with its 1920's setting, unfathomable, Lovecraftian monsters, and easy to learn rules fit the bill immediately.  Using Chaosium's now veteran Basic Role Playing (BRP) rules engine, most players get the rhythm of the game in a single play session.  And, inspiring horror games right up to the present day, there are the famous Sanity rules, which allow you to simulate the jaw-dropping terror that the characters in the game experience.  If you like horror and you like weird, you HAVE to try this pencil and paper classic.

$review_text.: I love P&P, and Jane Austen, and am usually game to see what another author has written to further our enjoyment of Austen things. So I was intrigued by this book that dealt with Charlotte and her marriage to Mr. Collins, and which implied a happy ending. Charlotte does not disappoint, and I enjoyed how the author had Charlotte realize that Mr. Collins did not intentionally insult people, but knew no better. The slow turn around in Charlotte's feelings for her husband, and Mr. Collin's slow, slow realization that perhaps Lady Catherine did not know best, and his eventual understanding of his feelings and love for his wife were some of the best parts of this book. I did not care for Colonel FitzWilliam's role, but understand what the author needed to accomplish. An excellent read and I recommend it to all P&P lovers.

$REVIEW.: This was a freebie thank goodness. It started very promising, but I noticed halfway through plot wasn't progressing. So I did some checking. Sure enough, the book didn't even talk about what the twisted arrangement was, let alone the story drags on for 4 novellas. So I don't get the HEA any time soon i guess. I rather the author just wrote their story out in one book, however long. Characters: I found the female lead's brother very unlikable, and despite's author's reasoning as to why heroine indulges him on his self destructive behavior, I found him manipulative. Just my opinion. The premise has promise, but I would have liked Emma to stand up to his brother. I've had enough of sibling manipulation with Rush and Nan (too far series by Abbi Glines). After reaching 56%, I finally gave up. Sitting on my DNF shelf.

I went to the Albergue with him and his wife, and journeyed with them. Amidst the practical advice he shares for surviving this (rather arduous) hike, he throws in a lot of humor and local flavor.Appropriate for the adventurous and not-so-adventurous, I highly recommend this book!

$review_text.: I saw The Dig from Backlit Fiction's email newsletter. The mythology was different from what I usually read, plus the cover is gorgeous, so I decided to go for it. And I liked it. Nothing to rave about, but it's something to pass the time. Hart's writing needs polishing, because all I can hear in the storytelling is a lot of babbling and rambling. Zoe's always talking about things that I think are better left unread by readers (obviously since they are not necessary).Zoe is smart but a loner. She found herself transported back in time when she explored an unknown room in her uncle's/aunt's archeological dig in Greece. Apparently, gods & goddesses existed here (well, in the form of teenagers, but still powerful). There she met a nymph and eventually, a golden-haired boy. Zeus. Now tell me if you read any YA fiction with Zeus as the lead character. No? Me too. Zeus is pretty sweet here, which makes me a little skeptical. He is powerful, yes, but it is not enough to rein in the other Olympians. Hera is in her true character. I liked her more than Zoe.Likes: Zoe's goddess-like powers. The labyrinth. The mutiny against Zeus.Dislikes: Which goddess Zoe takes up to? Demeter? Hart did not clear that up. The constant rambling thoughts of Zoe (I mean, you're gonna die and yet you remember this one time at high school, blah blah blah? Come on!) clear was a downer.The Dig is an okay read but I have read better mythology-based YA book.

$review_text.: I have thoroughly enjoyed this book


It is written for people who have acknowledge that not every infraction is worthy of a curse


The author does take time to remind you, but it's presumed your approach is from a place of maturity and centeredness


This book is not aimed at any spiritual group, is not an advertisement for the author's shop, and has an entertaining yet grounded approach

It draws upon historical facts to update, simplify and even customize that which you may be contemplating

It is free of "fluffy" hexes and curses, and states clearly from the beginning that no death spells are contained within

Ingedients are no further than the grocery store in most cases

Not contained within are formulae for multi purpose/good to have oils (just what you need for that curse is always provided), personal stories, hand holding or "readings of the signs"

Straight to the chase


A good partnering book of curses would be Dorothy Morrison's "Utterly Wicked", which is Wicca centered, but that I work around that with ease


Nicely bound hardcover and easy to read typeset make this a keeper

Enjoy!

$review_text.: 3 1/2 stars, we met Becca and Dickie awhile back and in each book we have gotten to know them better and now in Long Ride we finally get their story


Dickie has wanted Becca since he saw her but she lives in Nw York and being a attorney isn't used to men like Dickie


But when her life is in danger Dickie plans to keep her safe

Becca has hidden behind her work for years, after her abusive marriage ended Becca threw everything into her career and has had no time for anything else

When she first saw Dickie she was attracted to him but men were no where on her plans


So when she she finds herself spending more time with Dickie while he is keeping her safe Becca finds it harder and harder to deny her attraction to him.When neither can hide how they feel about each other Becca and Dickie admit their feelings for one another


As they begin to grow closer the person threatening Becca is caught and with all of her cases pretty much finished in Florida Becca goes back home to New York

Neither Dickie or Becca are happy when they are once agin apart and they have to decide if they can stay apart or if their relationship is worth the risk and the move forward
But quickly they find out that Becca may not be as safe as everyone thought and even if they are willing to make a life together they may not have that option.This was a nice book but it was missing something that book one and two had, I'm not saying it was bad but I was just hoping for more
We again see everyone from the previous book and we get to see their growth and were they are now as well as glimpses into future books
I think part of my problem was that since book one I have pictured Dickie as a really old over weight guy, I have no clue why he wasn't described as that and I have tried and tried to get that stupid thought out of my head but my brain can't erase what it made for itself *ugh*


Dickie was a great hero he was strong and protective and loved Becca, and we finally get to see more of what made Becca who she is now


I thought I pretty much had her figured out but this book really shows us who she is now and what she has been though.I do wish instead of so much of everyone else we would have had more Becca and Dickie (not that we don't get a lot ) but because Becca is everyones attorney it almost felt like the other stories encroached on theirs

I really liked the twist and kinda suspected it but it was still a nice addition to this story

I will continue this story, I'm excited to see who will still get their own book and to see where this series goes
I just hope we don't loose some of the grittiness that the first few books have(I know this isn't a full on gritty series, but I like at least some in a biker book) and that this series stays true to what it started as

Overall this was a nice quick read in a series I have liked and has kept pulling me back to read more.

Girard included a swell Sweater Styles primer.8) Spiral bound books are perfect when crafting; they lay totally flat...7) so you can easily see all of the full-page photos...6) and the 15 reproducible patterns which are included free.5) There are gift possibilities for all ages




.4) and a 50 page gallery de inspiration...3) clear diagrams, too...2) so it's a cinch to understand.And my #1 reason that I totally love this book:1) The coolest floral jumper EVER, in only 6 easy steps!With hard times upon us, it's time to dig through our closets (our neighbor's too, if they'll let us!) and pull out the sweaters that haven't been worn for the past season or two

Do mull, as some may be classics, or so stylin' they'll come back eventually, and you may really regret having to shell out $50 to get another...but don't mull for too long

Grab a needle and thread and go for it


This book is simple enough for anyone to understand - even non-English speakers could replicate anything in it as the photographs are gorgeous, and go hand in hand with diagrams
More advanced alterers/seamstresses will take off on their own once they see how it works.I looked forward to this book for months, and my expectations were realized


I will be trying out as many of these projects as I can sacrifice sweaters!

$REVIEW.: Von Money's "Price Rich" book isn't perfect. And it certainly isn't the last word on Kindle Publishing Profits. But it is good. Damned good. Certainly worth far more than the mere 99 cents this is going to cost you. And even if you don't necessarily agree with his main premise that selling your books at 99 cents is better than selling them at the standard $2.99, you will still get something out of this book. Unless, of course, you are already making good money with Kindle. In which case, you can either ignore this title or read it for the entertainment value. Von Money writes very well.In a nutshell, Von Money wants you to do three things. Just three.1) Write your dang ebook.2) Publish it on Amazon.3) Price it for 99 cents.And then Von Money starts building his case why this will make you money. Possibly even make you rich. I think he makes a decent case for the 99 cent pricing model, even with the reduced 35% royalty. But I would have liked to have seen additional supporting evidence, such as the actual results of head to head testing of a similar product priced at the standard $2.99 price point. Like you would do with split-testing. As we all know, in some cases, the higher price sells more product.Nevertheless, it's obvious that Von Money's Price Rich formula is working for him. And you know the old adage, if it's working for him then it COULD work for you. Just get the book and if you like the content, test it out with one of your books.

$REVIEW.: 21 Aldgate really brought to life the impact of the Blitz on the people living in the East End. I lived in England for 14 years and never found a book that made this so real.The characters were developed beautifully and so clear that the reader felt he/she knew them.The setting was also very believable. Because the East End of London was so bombed there is so little of it left. When reading 21 Aldgate, the community comes alive, all the pluses and minuses.We traveled in the area Victoria was sent and it is so peaceful. The author made it easy to see why Victoria wanted to stay and not return to her family.A wonderful read, one you don't want to put down.

$REVIEW.: The best testimony I can give about James Scott Bell's writing book is this: I haven't finished it yet. That's because the first 100 pages inspired me so that I put down the book, got off the sofa (on Thanksgiving Day, no less!) and wrote the first 1,000 words of my next novel. More importantly, I also wrote a more detailed outline than I've ever produced for a book (as an, I thought, confirmed seat-of-the-pants writer). I haven't been this excited about my own writing in years! I honestly can't wait to see what's in store in the next 130 pages of Plot & Structure...but first, I'm getting my story down while the inspiration is flowing. ~Deborah Raney, author of A Nest of Sparrows and Playing by Heart

$review_text.: When I downloaded this book on to my kindle, I placed it on my "have a quick look to see if it is any good" list,  thinking it might end up on my "when I have nothing better to read" list

How wrong I was


To be frank, I thought it would be one of those common sci-fi action and romance novels not a million miles away from a Star Wars novel - wrong again


As soon as I started reading it I was really hooked.The pace is dazzling; from the discovery that Chloe Rose is no mere mortal (echoes of Percy Jackson?) to her capture by a bounty hunter (echoes of Star Wars?), the story really gallops along with few pauses along the way
Some of the more experienced Sci-Fi readers might see some of the events  coming, but somehow, this only adds to the enjoyment! Almost comparable to Shrek when it reveals sounds or movie angles from previous well known movies.The one thing that put me off this book a little was it's lack of originality - let's face it, the idea of a hero who is not quite like the rest of us is hardly new: Harry Potter, Percy Jackson,  Thomas Covenant, Paul Atreides (Dune) .


and we could go on


Yet it makes up for it with great pace, interesting characters (well, compared to most others I read these days), and the quality we all want in a book: to find out what happens next.

She is open about how she had to reach the point to discover why purity is so important and encourages young women how to live set-apart for Christ.

$review_text.: This work is supermarket Faulkner: about as tedious as Absalom, Absalom, though containing much shorter sentences, and far less gripping than Intruder In The Dust. What used to be called miscegenation, Klansmen and their prejudices and foul language, brutality toward women, infidelity, and racial stereotypes are all in the brew, which is seasoned with a lushness of metaphor taken mainly from the kitchen -- e.g., from the first page of text, "The atmosphere back at the big house had been battered and coated with a thick crust of anticipation...." Such turgidity suggests that the author's bruited twenty-five year absence from literary endeavors was mainly devoted to culinary efforts.

$REVIEW.: Just finished the book and for the most part enjoyed it but found myself skipping pages due to D&eacute;j&agrave; vu feeling.*** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT ***My comments are as follows:The submarine Captain seemed to be a character rather then a real person and the byplay between the Captain and Jack felt forced.  I know the Chain of Command is important, but this is the end of the world we are talking about.  Heck, even the Navy SEALs were unwilling to unconditionally follow the Captain.  The Captain's insistence on going to Pearl Harbor, when he has had no radio contact, seen for himself that everyone is gone and just lost 5 men due to his negligence (he ignored Jack's earlier warning), lays the groundwork for mutiny.I also didn't buy the idea that Alan was able to open the building's door, the interior wall's door and the exterior protection wall's door, and no one noticed.  Are we to believe that none of the doors have locks?  The lack of camera coverage on the weakest points (aka the doors) is unrealistic.  I know that Lynn lamented the lack of cameras, but if the camera's are not watching the entrances / exits what are they watching and why?Also, not sure I believe that Micheal's band of Night Runners could have hidden from the AC-130 the following night.  I'm thinking that 2000+ Night Runners would create a very large heat signature that the AC-130 could spot the body heat concentration when you consider that the entire world is now dead, so other then body heat, there are no other heat sources to mask a congregation of bodies this large.  Even if they ran 15 miles per hour non-stop for 6 hours before sun-up they would still be well within the AC-130's area of operation.During the last battle I'm finding it hard to believe the team didn't have / use any large caliber machine guns or grenades?  Earlier books talk about raiding the existing armories so weapons availability is not an issue.  Think of the damage a 50 caliber would have inflicted.  Since these are all professional soldiers, with a lot of tactical experience, and this is a live or die situation, the 50 caliber would have been a natural defensive / offensive weapon.Lastly, not sure how the Sandra angle is going to turn out.  I wish a bit more time had been spent on this piece of the story and how and why the link between Sandra and Jack is so strong.

I basically got this book for my daughter but after hearing her talk about it I read it too since it wasn't too long, and you know what, I enjoyed it too. There was some romance but the part I enjoyed most was the drama the characters had to go through and the surprise that threw them all off their feet. This is a good story for paranormal lovers, not too much sex to make you uncomfortable but enough romance and action to keep you interested and that is what drew me in and kept me reading. Nice job!

$REVIEW.: Yes, as many of the previous reviewers have noted, the author talks about how the main characters in this book are mainly anti-govt types.  There is a reason for this.  I don't consider myself any type of anti-govt type but the author is correct in his characterization about how government would be totally inept in dealing with this sci fi scenario if it were to in fact happen.  Just look at the bloated wasteful incompetent govt we have today and that is why the characters have to branch off from established govt's just to be able to be practical and functional as a way to develop a resistance and plan of action against marauding aliens.This book is not meant to be the best book you have ever read or up to win prizes for exhalted literature.  It is an inexpensive, very fun read packed with action and does not disappoint as a sci fi space opera novel.  The author gives the reader exactly what a realistic sci fi reader expects in a space alien book here in Kindle books.  So many reviewers on this site get so caught up in micro analysing these books.  Just read it and enjoy it.  Nuttall does not disappoint in any of his books that I have read.A good book, and worthy of a sequel!

That's not to say that the morals didn't shine through, I just feel that they were not the strength of the story. I connected with the main characters and felt the pain and frustration cause I've been there too. Loving an addict is not an easy road and most of the time it doesn't end will, this story is very true to that. Elements could have been less drawn out and some parts could have been explained better but overall a strong story with a good message.

It is that good
And I'm not biased because I currently live in Atlanta, where the book is set in the 1980's, and am familiar with the world of the characters
(West End Mall hasn't changed in 20 years!)Told in the voices of the youngest ones affected, Silver Sparrow is the story of the families of James Witherspoon - one public, one secret


Like most of these situations, the secret family is well aware of the public one (but not vice versa) and the daughter of this union, Dana, struggles to understand her place in her father's life


Born just four months before her "sister", Chaurisse, Dana seeks to know everything about her and the two form a friendship that threatens to destroy the separate lives that James has created.Jones does a magnificent job of showing the depth of all those involved, to the point that I was unable to label anyone a villain in this scenario

In lesser skilled hands, James, the patriarch of these two families would have easily been the one to hate
But because Jones made the brilliant choice to give him a stutter that showed up when he was stressed or uncomfortable, I always felt sorry for him in a way (Doret & I disagree on this, LOL!).

$REVIEW.: Title: One Hot KnightSeries:  N/AAuthor:  Christy GissendanerGenre:  Romance/Sci-Fi/FantasyBlurb:  Stupid curse!Yves Sucat was a Crusader trapped in a canine body...until a beautiful twenty-first century dog groomer offered the missing link to break his spell. But Regina Patterson was no fluffy-headed female who would instantly melt at Yves' silvery seduction. The more time he spent with the tender-hearted blonde, the less he was able to keep his paws--hands!--off of her.Regina was much more comfortable with dogs than men, and the stunningly handsome - stunningly male - knight who now shared her apartment was no exception. She'd hoped to find a man as loyal as the pooches she pampered day after day, but would Yves's broken curse end with her own broken heart?Thoughts:  While the storyline for this one is a bit of a stretch - I mean, come on, we have a man that over 900 years ago was placed under a spell by a witch and was turned in to dog - that makes it all that more appealing for me.  If the author can pull it off.  There's nothing I like more than a story that is just totally out there, but the author manages to weave the tale so well that it could make you believe that such a world could exist.  So, I was excited to try this novel out.Unfortunately, in this case I was a bit disappointed.  The story just seemed to throw whatever details in there as needed to satisfy the typical happily ever after storyline - whether it actually made sense or not.  For instance, the witch who actually cursed Yves previously makes a return, and all of a sudden our heroine (miraculously!) discovers she's witch - even though there were no signs at all prior to point to that.  And she's strong enough to fend off a witch who was powerful enough over 900 years ago to turn a man into a dog for almost a millennium!  The author does attempt to make some explanation as to why that is, but it just didn't fly with me. There are other instances as well, but I don't want to give too much away.  And if the author did want to take on these slants regarding the hidden powers, etc. - then there needed to be some kind of buildup to that.I didn't feel any particular connection with the characters.  To be honest, I think I liked the first few chapters the best, and that was when Yves was still a dog!  For some reason (for me anyway) it seemed like once Yves returned to his human form, I lost whatever small connection I had with the story.  And once he does return to his original form, I just didn't feel any kindof chemistry between the characters.Don't get me wrong, the author herself is skilled, but for me this story just seemed a little underdeveloped and inconsistent.Rate:  C-Review by: Sarah[...]

$REVIEW.: This book details the case of an elder of a closed religious community using his power to prey upon a young girl given to his care


 Rayna stood against the overwhelming condemnation of many in her community to face her her abuser and demand  justice

 For me, the outstanding story is the defamation she faced in making her charge
 Yarrow does a convincing job of presenting the trial and the guilty verdict


 While I clearly cannot judge the outcome of the trial, it is clear that the community attempted to try the case by attacking the victim
 From this perspective, and from the previous failure of leaders who knew of this man's abuse to take action, the lesson to be learned is the protection of those who come forward

 Clearly, the failure of good men to take action when sexual molestation is present means that each victim has to die a little on the stand
 This book takes a clear stand to protect.

$REVIEW.: Great book so far, this series is an excellent reference source to see the deeper things of God and his relationship with His people. Reading it will fine tune your discernment and understanding of the varied ways people view scripture and what it actually says and means. It can be fascinating to learn of the peculiar ways the Jewish sages have sidestepped some of the main and plain of what is written. I would think it is getting harder and harder for Dr. Brown to find Rabbi's to debate him as his love is real, his knowledge great and each are further enhanced by the anointing of the Holy Spirit. He is a hard man not to like, I can't imagine their are many who try and love others in truth who would not enjoy a coffee with him sometime.If your interested in truth seek it out and buy it!

$REVIEW.: Just a wonderfully written book given to me at the exact time I needed it.There is so much to take from this book, I don't know where to begin except that Bill reminded me that even when I feel lost I'm still on the path and that there are many paths to our lives, not just one.  He writes, "God faithfully delivers our lives, even when we can't read the address ... Lostness also reminds us that we may only see part of the path at a time."I must have highlighted a dozen or so such passages in this book.God walks with us on every path.  We are never alone.I only wish the book was longer.

$review_text.: I really wanted to like this book
 I'm an organ enthusiast, having attended hundreds of organ concerts, including ones by Virgil Fox at the fabulous Hammond Castle described in this book
 (I won't go so far as to call myself an organ player, although I have trained a bit and can punch out a few notes.)  I have a good collection of organ music and listen to it a lot


 I've read organ books like Schweitzer's  J
S


Bach.And Craig Whitney, the author, is clearly a talented researcher

 I can only imagine the thousands of hours he put into going over every conceivable concert program, book, and letter relating to his topic

 I can just see him poring over his voluminous notecards laboriously putting together each paragraph of this documentary of the history of the organ in America.Only problem:  it's BORING

 Is it the story itself which is boring, or his telling of it?  Probably a little of both

 I'm giving the book three stars to try to show how much I value the scholarship that went into the tome while at the same time I can't recommend the flaccid narrative and tone.There are certainly dramas in the history of the organ in America that could have been played out much more, well, dramatically here
 Something beyond, Player A was a good organist, got famous, had some personal issues, then died

 Organbuilder B had some good ideas, built some good organs, then died


 Some people thought organs should be like X, but then there were other ones that thought they should be like Y.This is still a useful book for those wanting to flesh out their knowledge of US organ history, but far from a must-read.

$review_text.: I received a copy of DIVORCE FOR BEGINNERS by Sophie King in exchange for an honest review.Divorce for Beginners begins with Alison and David. Now that their youngest has flown the nest, Alison is looking forward to something calm and quiet, but it seems as though David has something else in mind. Then we meet Karen, who on the verge of busting at the seams after leaving her husband Paul, many years prior. She becomes the ideal candidate to start the "How to Survive Divorce" club. Then we meet Ed, who seems to be the sole person left that believes in marriage. Well, to be frank, he believes in it a little too easily because he has already done it three times. Throw in a woman named Lizzie and we have quite the group.This book is quite the tale and ironically, even though I am happily married, I quite enjoyed myself. There are quite a few mysterious and secretive things going on behind the scenes and I thought that really added to the appeal. Then throw in some sibling issues, life with kids, parents, aging, dating and sex, and you have quite a recipe for an entertaining book. I really enjoyed getting to know each character on a personal level but I enjoyed them as a foursome even more. Overall, this story is very entertaining although it is often times quite sad. But, Sophie makes up for it in full with some great laughs and a lot of heartfelt moments.

$review_text.: &#60;I received an ARC copy from RockStar Lit PR in exchange for an honest review&#62;5 Stars!!!5 Flames for Hotness!!I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!G.T. and Casey are one of my favorite MC couples. I read Ravage Me book one in the series and loved it but it is such a different ride than this book. Both stories are raw, gritty and violent but this book took me on an emotional ride that left me in tears and a constant lump in my throat I had a hard time getting rid of.Casey and G.T. have been through it. Poor Casey is all I could think through the entire first part of the book until G.T. was told some pertinent information and I felt bad for him as well. This book made me feel!!! This book was heart wrenching. It also made me smile and laugh out loud on several occasions. The headstone part in this book tore me up with sadness but it contained so much love from a family I cried harder. (you will know what I am talking about when you read this book) The more I got to know G.T. and Casey the more I rooted for them. Ryan does not make you wait too long to get to the juicy stuff and I love that about her writing. She focuses on the heart of the matter instead of a bunch of nonsense. She can write and amazing love story and some super hot sex.The mystery in this story rocked! I sat on the edge of my seat for a better part of the book wondering how it was all going to play out. Finishing the book at 2am I was a nervous wreck and had a hard time going to sleep. I love it when a book has this much effect on me. Great writing!This book can be read as a stand-alone but the ending will leave you hanging for the next story. Casey and G.T. get their happy ending. I would highly recommend this book and the complete series. When you read the book 1 and book 2 you will get a grip on the entire story and the MC&#8217;s members.Ryan Michele you are so awesome, I cannot wait for the next installment of the Ravage MC&#8217;sMy Favorite QuotesPart of me fell in love with Gage Thomas Gavelson when I was seven years old though, he threw mud in my face because I wouldn&#8217;t jump in it with him.

$review_text.: Karen Amanda Hooper's TANGLED TIDES will make readers wish they lived under the sea.Yara's eighteenth birthday isn't about turning into an adult, but a monster. She's transformed into a mermaid, and that's only the beginning of what she discovers within our realm. Selkies, Sirens, and Gorgons also have a place, and she's caught in the middle of being herself and saving sea monster-kind. Then, there is Treygan and Rownan. Two brothers who need her, but only one can have her. Yara has to discover what she is willing to sacrifice or they'll all be doomed.The beginning of TANGLED TIDES starts a bit slow for me and is a little confusing jumping in and out of three different points of view, but quickly the confusion clears up. TANGLED TIDES is an ingenious tale combining Greek myths and sea monsters, such as mermaids, selkies, etc. The characters swoop the reader up into their lives. Some parts brought smiles, laughter, and tears. I want to be a mermaid, then a siren, even a gorgon sounds pretty cool. Hooper unveils this magnificent world she created, and I want to live in it.Despite the slight hiccups in the beginning, TANGLED TIDES by Karen Amanda Hooper has caught me by hook, line, and sinker. I can't wait to delve below the sea in book two.

Having said that... This book was a let down. Towards the end of the novel it's starts to show some promise, but after trudging through the first 2/3 of the novel, I gave up. Many of the other reviewers state the issue with the character, so I won't go into it other than to say I agree.

$review_text.: True Faced written by Bill Thrall, Bruce McNicol, is a 147 page book which talks about God's grace, authenticity, and understanding how to trust God instead of just pleasing Him.  Through this book, which is an "Experience Edition" (downsized from a bigger book for small group use), the authors explain how when one walks on the path of pleasing God, they end up wearing a mask and trying to live up to a set of rules instead of trusting God with who they are.This book is split up into 7 chapters.  The first couple of chapters talk about grace, being real, and finding people in our lives to be real with.  The rest of the book talks about being loved, forgiveness, repentance, and maturity.I wasn't overly impressed with this book.  I thought most of what was said was really nothing new.  It was just written in a different way.  The concept of God's grace not being earned is not a light bulb moment, at least not for me.  I was also disappointed in the chapters on forgiveness and repentance.  Although I thought the authors did a good job explaining how to bring our hurts to God and forgive, the parts on going to the person and telling them how they hurt us seemed like a let down.  They didn't discuss at all how to deal with a person that refuses to forgive and only touched lightly on forgiveness vs. trusting someone after you forgive.  The book talked a lot about grace and how God loves you and how we can only love when we are loved.  However, the authors failed to talk at all about how we've hurt others and how to deal with that.  It's good to show others when they've offended us, but what about when we've offended someone?  I also would have liked some ideas on how to find people to trust if you have issues with trusting. The book talks a lot about opening up to people, but it doesn't really explain how to get to that point with people. The discussion for those types of questions were just not in the book.I think the message is important: Stop wearing the masks and trying to live with good intentions.  Instead, walk the path to trusting God and be entered into the throne room of grace where you can live out your faith and be accepted as you are without all the fluff.  I think this book might have been helpful for me when I was a new Christian, but most of the stuff in this book is just a repeat of other things I've read.  I do appreciate the authors taking the time to emphasize our hurts and how to deal with them, but found it lacking in other areas.  This book also comes with a DVD and guide which was not sent to me, so all I had was the book to go off of.  Despite the drawbacks, this book was a good reminder to me to take off the mask and be more humble, especially in letting others into my life and being real with them.  I think this book is worth the read and the reminder.Disclosure: I received this book free from the publisher through NavPress blogger review program. I was not required to write a positive review.

The other thing about this book is it continues to grow the story in a way that makes the reader believe in the story, it doesn't get far fetched so that you're left thinking yeah right. I still hold firm on my review of The Guardians that this story needs to be on the big screen. If you love The Guardians and Ossendar you will love Valley of the Ancients. Enjoy.

$REVIEW.: *** I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review ***This is one of those books that I wasn&#8217;t so sure of when I started.  However as I progressed and the story become more in-depth I realized I was captivated and couldn&#8217;t put it down.The primary plot is centered on Margaret who is a self imposed shut in and only leaves the apartment when she is positive she will not run into anyone she knows.  Some what voyeuristic she watches those in her apartment building and constructs stories revolving their lives.  She is extremely eccentric and at times humorous in her antics. And due to a series of mishaps her neighbors are drawn into her life regardless of the consequences. I found the entire cast to be well developed and relatable and some more endearing then others.Throughout the book Margaret tells five different stories. Each one starting off with only a little snippet but as the story unfolds they become more meticulous and comprehensively profound. Completely different from one another they have an impact that is more far reaching then originally let on.With all of that being said I did find the story hard to follow until I became more acquainted with the authors writing style. He does jump in and out of a narrative sometimes without warning.What this book showcases exceptionally well is how unique people&#8217;s lives really are. All in all this is a very interesting read and I look forward to reading more by this exceptional storyteller.

Very clever story line with the half mortal witch Kate who owns a matchmaking business for both the human and more than human world.  Plenty of suspense with the death of a client, namely the prince of vampires, and her attempts to solve the crime.  She is aided by her best friend, who happens to be a vampire, and her dog who channels a deceased Mafia hit man.  The characters are terrific and there were times when I was laughing so hard I couldn't see the page.  Definitely a book I would recommend to anyone for sheer enjoyment.

$review_text.: Ingrid Anders has written such a charming book. As she gathers you into her story and takes you along with it, you, or certainly I, felt as though I was there in Taiwan with her heroine Kat Vespucci.  This is a rare gift.It&#8217;s a heartwarming, hilarious story about a girl from New Jersey, USA, who having dipped her toe in the water by living in Berlin for a year, takes herself off to Taiwan at the suggestion of a relative, to work in an English Language school.As she tries to understand, never mind assimilate, into the local culture, which is totally unlike anything she has experienced before, she meets Zhang Wayne, a handsome Tainese man. This is her description for the populace who claim, and insist, on being known as either Chinese or Taiwanese, depending on their heritage, as Kat&#8217;s befuddled mind tries to make sense of it all, including the unorthodox payment of utility bills.As Wayne is the eldest son and in no hurry to marry, he is holding up the betrothal and eventual marriage of his younger brother (by one minute) and his fianc&eacute;, who endeavor to find ways and means to move him out of the way, including hastening his death if necessary.Ingrid&#8217;s writing is descriptive but with an economy of words, such as &#8216;A tealeaf that had escaped down the spout of the teapot swirls around&#8217; that really sets the scene.Let&#8217;s have more of Kat&#8217;s adventures and a lot more of Ingrid Anders writing and storytelling.

 There were things that I learned that I did not know before
 Of  course being in New Zealand I realize that the laws there are different than in this beautiful USA

 Also being in the 70's and 80's I was shocked to understand the difference between now and then
 It is just an enjoyable read and I would recommend it to anyone

$REVIEW.: When my wife sent this to me and asked me to read it to say i was sceptical was not entirely accurate
I had no intention of reading the book

Then i thought at least skim it so.she won't keep at me about it

Twenty minutes into it I was hooked

Jill is not just as writer but a PhD
She's is the real thing,a serious scientist

She talks like a scientist and has scientific conclusions that she helps anyone understand


She gives real information about how to do this and real exercises that seem to work


It is happening for me


 I will report back but this process is helping me as a businessman,  as a boss, as a friend, and especially as as a  man and husband
For a few dollars what have you got to lose.

$review_text.: As some others said, I wouldn't bother with the long version.  This gives you the gist of what you need to do and explains it plainly enough without alot of information that most of us don't need or want or will even remember.  I am just not one of those people who can skip breakfast--I wake up starving.  I am trying this with skipping dinner instead.  If nothing else, it has helped me make conscious choices about what and when I eat.

$REVIEW.: This is a very good book for the first time owner of a M1A (Not a lot of M-14s out there) and provides a good, although somewhat skimpy background on the development of this fine rifle.  That is why the 4 our of 5 rating.  The book also goes off on a bit of a tangent about optics and other areas but not so far as to detract from its intent which is to familiarize a new owner with the rifle he has.  I like the style.  I like the variety and the serial number and basic technical data.  To me it is the perfect first book for the owner of his first M1A.  Having had the good fortune to bet my life on the M-14 some years back (along with 14 mags; heavy!) I gripped about the weight right up until I started clearing out the jungle in front of me.  Given the choice of the M-14 and the M-16 today I would gladly continue gripping about the weight right up to when Obama's henchmen showed up at my door.
$SUMMARY.: Good overview of the M-14/M1A

$REVIEW.: It takes a little time to light the fuse, but it's all worth it. Atlanta Burns is done with bullies and deals with them and worse in this fine novella. Dark but marbled with humor, this classic revenge tale amps up the tension and sets us up for a great series. It's got meat to it, and kept me busy through a few lunch hours. It tales one good tale and gets us ready for more. Wendig knows how it's done.All you need for a story is a girl and a gun... and here you get a whole lot more.

Everyone was raving about it and I read the first few chapters and I was having a hard time getting into it. It moves slow in the begining, but it is so so so worth it. Best read in such a long time. I've never read anything like it. It's completely origninal. Loved it!!!

$review_text.: This short gives you the insight on the some of the couple you only gets pieces of in Opposites. You get to see just what all went on in the library, how Rian calms Cirian down, a look back to how they became married, fun with ice cream and another special couple shares there love as well.I really liked this insight to how Rian and Cirian got together and how much they really care for each. I love getting to know Cirian more as in the first book I wasn't sure if I was going to like him much. He never seemed to have a soft side but in The Library you see what really makes him tic. He is a really caring guy and you even get  to see a funny side to him as well. Raven and Tanis shouldn't be together but Tanis will not take no for an answer. Raven can't help but want him back even when he knows it can't be. You really get lots of hot M/M action in this one and it only makes you want more of these characters.

$review_text.: I enjoyed reading Much Ado About Madams which is the second book in Jacquie Rogers' Hearts of Owyhee series
 She was able to have the same humor in this book that she had in the first one and I thought it read just as smoothly as the first book also

 I think my favorite character would have to be Lucinda because she tries her best to handle any situation she is in

 Lucinda comes to Dickshooter, Idaho thinking she is going to be teaching young children and finds outs her students are closer to her age if not older, but she stays anyway to teach
 Then there are at least two scenes where she tries to save Reese, the man who supposedly hired her to teach the "children."  I don't want to give any spoilers, but if you want to check out my full review, you can go to bestonlinereviewofbooks.com.

At first the hero, Dan does seem a bit of a clich&eacute; but he actually turns into a well rounded character.The action scenes are well done and there were lots of amusing moments included a few times where I laughed out loud.The main story line is not amazingly original but it does flow very nicely and works pretty well.It really is a very quick and entertaining read.

$review_text.: This book covered theology of the body so well, and was so beautifully written, that I enjoyed every single moment of it
Stimpson manages to take a complex topic and make it easy to read and easy to understand for even those who are new to the concepts

 I have read books on theology that make it difficult for you to digest, but Stimpson's writing is nearly poetic in quality and I didn't just enjoy the ideas she shared, but the way she shared them, too

 I highly recommend this book if you are looking for a deeper understanding of the Theology of the Body and the Catholic Sacramental World View.

$REVIEW.: This book brought so many emotions up


Georgia is a very complex woman who has been through a lot


Tristan is a complicated, sexy as hell, person who rocks Georgia's foundation

Initially, I had thought less of her because of what happened with Tristan
But then once you get the whole story behind the relationship between Georgia and Kenny, that pretty much changed everything

Georgia has not only been through a lot at a very young age, but the one person she believed would always be there for her constantly betrayed her trust and love

I loved that Georgia's friends were instantly behind her with everything, but also let her know their displeasure when they believed she had misstepped

Tristan was good for Georgia, but she needed to free herself from the past before she could move into the future


It took some time, and a whole lot of heartbreak, but Georgia finally did what she needed to do

She set out to find out who she was, independant of anyone else
I was very pleased with the ending of this book, and then to find out that there was a second book - damn! I can't wait to read that
Adriane has always been able to tell these amazing stories, that initially you think are very straight forward, but then she throws that twist in there that just makes you re-think everything


I love her writing and the characters she brings to life
I can't wait to see what else she has in store for the future.

$SUMMARY.: Wonderfully complex, emotional, phenomenal read!!

$REVIEW.: Did I enjoy this book: It wasn&#8217;t terrible.  There was nothing exceptional about it; I&#8217;d liken it to the B-movie version of The Hobbit, but I fear that&#8217;s doing it a disservice.  It wasn&#8217;t BAD.  Despite the fact that Prown&#8217;s world is seriously similar to Middle Earth (halflings, elves and all), I didn&#8217;t mind as much as I thought I would (or should).  Instead of being annoyed that Prown borrows Tolkein&#8217;s world, I sort of wondered if this was, perhaps, a Hobbity town across the ocean that Gandalf hadn&#8217;t quite discovered yet.  &#8230;A middling Middle Earth, perhaps?Mostly I think Thimble Down is delightful and funny, and you&#8217;ll likely enjoy it if you know why it is the dwarves agree to bring Bilbo along on their journey.  Even if you don&#8217;t know about Bilbo, I&#8217;d wager a pint you&#8217;d be interested to hear his tale after reading Thimble Down.Would I recommend it: Yeah, why not?  If you&#8217;re a LOTR fan (and you can get past the &#8216;ZOMG this is like, exactly the same&#8217; business), you&#8217;ll get a good chuckle out of it.Will I read it again: Meh.As reviewed by Melissa at Every Free Chance Book Reviews.(I received a copy of this book for review purposes.)

$REVIEW.: This book was so much fun to read. It had excitement and danger from page one, not to mention all the steamy love that drifted of the pages. I love a historical romance with a little danger thrown in for good measure!Our heroine is young and in hiding and has been for most her life because her father is known as the most hated man in England and well even though he is dead she is living with the consequences. Then somehow she seems to be found out and is rescued by the one man who probably hated her name more than anyone. But she is sure her father was innocent and soon Julian our hero of the story starts to realize that too. Then their search for the truth begins.I love that the sparks started to fly immediately! Sometimes that is just right. I also liked a lot that you were to keep guessing for quite a while who that bad guy was, that is a sure winner to keep a reader's interest. Julian is such a lovable character who just falls flat on his face when he meets the stubborn Alyce. Alyce on the other hand fights a bit with her feelings and she also have a loyalty conflict that almost tear her apart.This was a great read that I enjoyed a lot. It was exciting and fun to read and I recommend to everyone who is historical romance fan!

$review_text.: This book is filled with good hard fundamental workouts.  Other reviewers have critized the workouts for lack of variation but there is only so many different ways to put push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups, and leg exercises together.  I thought there were a bunch of good exercises in here.  I use it as a reference book and mix and match from the various exercises presented.  Admittedly, some of the exercises I knew already (I've been at it for 20 years now), but this book had a enough good stuff to make it worth it.  As a bonus, the physical fitness tests of the various military units are presented within.Note that most of the exercises are body-weight exercises.  Although there is a smaller section on weight lifting, I wouldn't use this book as a reference for that.  Note also that the workouts in the book are high level, high intesity workouts.

$REVIEW.: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED


This book is a meticulously researched guide to natural solutions for children's academic, emotional, and family struggles


It draws on solid, empirical, peer-reviewed research from recent studies that prove the author's basic premise: that today's children suffer from nature-deficit disorder, and that only by allowing children to play more often in natural settings (manicured lawns and playground equipment DON'T count!) will we find true healing for our little ones.I encourage readers to not only read the entire book, but to share it with educators, administrators, clergy, community designers, and parents everywhere--it is THAT good!

$REVIEW.: I have read much of Tolkien's works, from the Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit to the Silmarillion to Roverandom and the Lays of Beleriand, even Sigurd and Gundrun;  I have a firm basis in the primary texts of Tolkiendom. But I haven't read many biographies about him.  So when I saw this book on the Booksneeze list, I jumped at the opportunity.My first surprise about this book was the size. It's only a little wider and taller than a mass market paperback, and a good deal thinner--easily carried in a purse or backpack.  The flexible end-`papers' make excellent bookmarks in a pinch, and the text, though small, is easy to read.The content was also excellent, a well-rounded perspective on one of the great minds of speculative literature, if not the patron saint of Christian fantasy.  Covering Tolkien's life from his childhood in South Africa to his rough courtship with Edith and into his creative life at Oxford, this book is accessible for Tolkien-philes and newcomers alike. It even ends with a chapter covering his legacy among modern culture.Four of Five starsAlthough you probably don't care, I received a free copy of this book from Thomas Nelson as part of their BookSneeze program in exchange for writing and posting an honest review. I was not required to praise the book.

$REVIEW.: The "Crystal Vision Tarot" is the brainchild of fantasy artist Jennifer Galasso. It is a traditional 78 card deck (with the inclusion of one extra card - the "Unknown Card", which Galasso defines as representing questions (or areas) that are not ready to be answered yet. The Unknown card can refer to something from the past, or something ab out to be in the future.The Major Arcana titles follow the traditional line, with Strength at VIII and Justice at XI. The suits are Wands, Cups, Swords, and Pentacles, with the Court Cards entitled King, Queen, Knight, and Page.The backs are done in a beautiful lavender color, with a 1/4" white border. The middle of the card features a crystal ball. The backs are reversible.The card faces show the same 1/4" white border, with the card title in across the bottom, with the background color indicating the suit: the Major Arcana is yellow, Wands are light red, Cups are pink, Swords are blue, and Pentacles are gray. The artwork is done in a fantasy style, using reds, greens, lavender, and dark brown predominately. There is a sense of gentleness and "otherworldliness" that draws one in, and makes one feel right at home.The LWB (Little White Book) that accompanies this deck gives a short introduction, then presents each card, text only. The energy of the card is discussed, with upright and reversed meanings. At the end of the LWB the layout for the Celtic Cross is given - meanings only, no sample reading. This is followed by several blank pages to take notes on.The art style is very gentle fantasy, with the imagery reflecting the elemental qualities of the card. This deck could be used by anyone, from any religious or cultural background, and any level of reading ability. This deck would be one that I would not hesitate to set out as a deck for clients to choose from.

$review_text.: This is the story of artist Tamara de Lempinski and her model, Rafaela Fano.  I had never heard of the artist Tamara de Lempinski prior to reading this novel.  I want to preface the majority of this review by letting you know that I read 80% of this novel.  I just could not read it all.  I was largely bored with it.  This is a novel for those people who love historical novels that are pretend based on real people from the past.  Lempinski  was a 1930's Art Deco artist.The best thing about this book is I was prompted to do some research on this artist and I looked up her work online.  You can do that without buying this ficitionalized what if book about her and her model/lover Tamara.  This one just wasn't my cup of tea.  I tried, oh how I tried....but I'm character driven, and this was plot driven in my opinion.  I could have gotten over that but the pace was just so slow.  No cliffhanger or ongoing issue that pulled me in to want to "find out" what happens.

$review_text.: This book is absolutely fantastic!  It's a real treat to be able to read the original Archie comic strips.  Montana's artwork is just gorgeous.  If, like me, you grew up on Archie in the 70s and 80s, you know how "standardized" the art became as more and more artists came on board (much like "The Simpsons" today).  In the daily strips, there is a depth to the artwork that's just not present anymore.  Take a look at the sample pages to see what I mean.  You'll see subtle shading, changes in line width, different angles that draw your eye in or out of the page... It's Archie, but probably not in the way you've seen him before!The stories themselves are great too, full of humor and adventurous situations, again different from the Archie's of my youth.  All of the characters are there, just presented in different and dynamic ways, before they became "caricatures" of themselves, as ironic as that sounds.  And they're genuinely funny, too!I commend IDW for keeping the legacy of all of these classic strips alive for future generations.  Whether it's Archie, Blondie, L'il Abner, Terry and the Pirates... we're fortunate to have them all preserved in such a beautiful format.Hopefully they'll come out with subsequent volumes (and the Sunday color strips) soon.

$review_text.: I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest (non-reciprocal) review.The summary of this novel includes the line "This passionate novel mixes the recent history of Venezuela with powerful fiction", and after reading it I can say I definitely felt the passion. The authors of this book clearly knew their subject well, and if the ultimate point of this book is to spread the message of what has happened in Venezuela then I think it does a very good job of evoking compassion for the people there.PROS:- I didn't find many mistakes while reading this novel, and it's apparently a translation. Had I not read that it was a translation I wouldn't have known that, so it's a very good translation.- The authors seem to have a great grasp on the subject. There were many spots in the book that had footnotes to explain the details of what they were talking about.- The characters varied in their personalities and beliefs. As the novel goes on it's easy to understand their motivations and mindsets.- The overall feel of the book, and the way it presents how an oppressive government effects its people, is done very well. I could see why some of the characters felt trapped in their situations, or why they felt so angry.CONS:- Many times the book wandered off subject. The chapter might begin with one character doing something, then it would mention another character; and at the mention of the second character it would go on for paragraphs about something that happened in the past with that character. After that anecdote the story might snap back to the first subject and continue on, or it might wander off on a third subject.This could get really confusing because I might start off reading about Rodrigo doing something at his friend's house, and then suddenly be reading all about the friend's maid. It seemed almost like it couldn't mention a new name without including some sort of anecdote about them.With all of the side narratives, even if they were interesting, it was easy to get lost on what the characters were originally doing.This isn't the type of book I would normally read but I don't regret reading it. I think it provides a very interesting view of Venezuela, and anyone interested in the subject should definitely give it a read. I'd give it around a 4.5.

$review_text.: Reviewed by: StaceyBook provided by: PublisherReview originally posted at Romancing the BookNot all debut novels are created the same. As authors grow and write more books, you can see how they've grown and their writing style changes. Jennifer Lowery's Hard Core does not come off as a debut novel.While I usually don't go for the mercenary as a leading man, Ms. Lowery had me changing my mind. Injured and at the mercy of a small village surgeon, Christian's injuries have his defenses down and during this time, we learn that he is not just some hard-hearted killer; he has a human side and it's nice to see his vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, kind hearted surgeon Alana, who herself has some demons that she's fighting, finds herself attracted to a man that she should totally avoid.Gotta love the opposites attract when it's so blazingly clear how opposite they are: killer vs. healer.There was so much action and drama and to see these two having to work together against such a vile enemy had my heart leaping off the page a time or two. And when Christian's team shows up to help, it added more hero power to a group and had me hoping that Jennifer Lowery would use them in future books!

$REVIEW.: Book 3 of the Keeping Her Series, shifts to the Alpha for the Lionsgate pack. When Lucas finds out that the woman he loved was still alive, he was determined to correct past mistakes and make her his mate. Miley was a latent wolf who couldn't shift. Lucas fired her because he realized that he loved her and didn't want her to be under attack from his enemies.This is the strongest story of the series and ties up some of the unfinished business from the other two books. I really liked the interaction between Lucas and Miley and it was fun to see the whole team together. The ladies reactions to their mates is amusing and entertaining and the overreaction by the shifters is really funny.I wished there had been more information on Miley and her background, hopefully that will be mentioned as the series progresses or maybe in a novella?If you like this series, get comfortable because there won't be another until 2015 - sigh!  Definitely an enjoyable light read.

$REVIEW.: I didn't want it to end! My heart hurts for all the characters in this book, almost the most for Hawk. I didn't like Seth in book one, but Hawk has so many redeeming qualities...have to wait for book 3 to see if he can keep them. Jada and Tobias..we didn't really get to see much of their relationship, but I can't wait to find out more in the next book!

$REVIEW.: This is a fantastic fantasy novel that grabbed me from the first page! I loved it!I usually do a character breakdown at this point, but with this story it is very difficult to do as there are so many different characters and they each have their own personalities. The story is told as a narration by The Great Atuvus, in the oral tradition to the children around a fire. He spins the most fantastical and exciting tale night after night. As he tells the story, he not only captured the children's attention and imagination, he captured mine to. I was riveted by the prose and the flow of the story. The story follows Raven and Le-thon as they travel through strange lands and face many perils on their quest to save Raven's family from the clutches of N'atax.I love reading fantasy, because I can let my imagination run riot! Where else can you find talking trees and fantastical flying beings? I did find some of the scenes in the story a bit long and drawn out, but all in all, this book was a most exciting rollercoaster ride with action and adventure of epic proportions! The boar-riders gave me the heeby-jeebies! I certainly wouldn't want to meet these guys any time soon - They are quite scary! N'atax was terrifying! There are also some wonderful, and helpful, characters that made me smile. Pa-Tee and Pa-Tu are brothers, and are the sweetest of characters; I just wanted to hug them! I loved the ending of the story, and it left me all warm and fuzzy!Randy Massey has written an amazing fantasy that is action packed, fast paced and completely absorbing. I would be interested in reading the next book in The Legends of Arth series, Daedalus Rises. I highly recommend this book if you love fantasy, action and adventure. - Lynn Worton
$SUMMARY.: Epic Fantasy!
