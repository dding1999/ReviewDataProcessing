$REVIEW.: I read these books as a girl. Re-read them as a young adult and now reading again as a senior citizen. They are written to a child level but the stories are so nice that doesn't matter to me. I wished all my life to have her auburn hair. Mine was a nondescript chestnut. I didn't have her freckles but I looked for them regularly. Anne as a child was not always responsible for the trouble she got into - there was often someone else who misplaced or mislabeled things for her to make her mistakes. Still love the books.

$review_text.: The author provides plenty of evidence to prove that giants did indeed exist in pre-Indian America.  To be honest, I started to get bored reading about all of the skeletons that have been dug up even though I accept their necessity in the book.  I found the latter half of the book to be more interesting as the author delved into the blond haired and red haired giants that were more Caucasian than Native American.  Also interesting to me were the details of some of the burial mounds, bogs, and guano caves.  Overall, the book was a pleasure to read and quite informative.  Why wasn't this taught in high school history class?

$REVIEW.: This book will open your eyes to the real spiritual climate at most universities in America today.  Forget the previous reviewer's negative comments about it falling prey to.... Manichaeanism.  (I hate it when books fall prey to Manichaenism, don't you?)  My husband and I have had a lot of exposure to Ivy League universities in America and the spiritual climate is unbelievably tilted against Christians. The author herself went to Harvard where she no doubt encountered similar situations in the classroom.  It is a well researched book and, frankly, it's just a good read. Buy it.  Don't fall prey to Manichaeanism.  Buy it.

$REVIEW.: Set in the same community as Ms Preston's short story, "Yard Sale" but involving a different (VERY different) collection of the citizenry, "Laid to Rest" is a fun example of what sometimes happens to those "champagne dreams and caviar wishes."Darlene Higginbottom has read enough celebrity magazines to know that she's not only destined for stardom, but that she's willing to whatever is necessary to escape rural Clayburn and head out west. In fact, she's certain that as soon as her feet touch the sacred ground of Hollywood that numerous producers and studio executives will fall to fighting in the street to become the first to sign her to a lucrative contract. That's why, not to put to fine a point on it, she's willing to "put out" to "get out." Destiny after all, needs a nudge here and there. If that means accepting portraits of dead presidents from the local politicians in exchange for her companionship and... uhm, "favors," well, there are worse ways to raise money for a bus ticket, aren't there?I didn't find this particular story quite as much fun as "Yard Sale," but it is written in the same style and pace and wound up being very enjoyable in its own right. My wife and I are quickly becoming big fans of Patricia Ann Preston's work and if these two tales are an example of what we can expect, she's going to have a long and successful career indeed.

$REVIEW.: As with most people, this case had me riveted. The book really doesn't explain the who or the why to my satisfaction but it does amplify how dysfunctional this family was, if you had any doubts. The real story cannot be told due to client privilege but it showcases how many people appear guilty. Much like JonBenet Ramsay- you may not have the killers name but no one is truly innocent., except the victims.

$REVIEW.: I'm going to say the same thing I've already read a few fellow reviewers say, I really wanted to like this book! But by the end, I just can't rate it up there with books I love.Ever since Twilight took over the YA book world several years ago, these sort of supernatural thriller/romances have been hugely popular in the publishing world. It seems like a handful of them come out each day. I've read some pretty good ones, a couple I've loved, but unfortunately so many are lacking. While The Mephisto Covenant seemed like a fun read when I read the description, it fell short in reality.Those readers looking for a fast-paced read will appreciate this book's first chapter as well as the pacing throughout. The author wastes no time getting into the thick of things, and by the end of the first chapter you already know the main character's secret, the hero's secret, the villain's secret, and a "romantic" storyline is already building. I actually appreciated this fast start, as I'm the type of reader who can easily get bored and lose interest when I start a new book. However, this author dumps a lot of information on the reader very fast. Too fast, really. I ended up wondering where the suspense was, the little details that would have been fun to learn by surprise or as a thrill were simply flat-out stated by one of the characters within the first chapter or two. There is very little you're left wondering about, and frankly, when it comes to what should be an exciting, suspenseful read, this is just no fun.The plot centers around Sasha, who is "Anabo" which is a rare woman who is a descendant of Eve before the fall of man. (Note: While this book does tap into some Christian aspects, such as Adam & Eve & Lucifer & God, that's really where the similarities end, nothing in this book is Biblically supported, I just have to say.) The hero, whom we meet at the end of chapter one, is "Mephisto". To be honest, I'm still a little uncertain at what exactly Mephisto means. Something about being evil, but not really, and they take evil people (but not all evil people, just those who have pledged their souls to Lucifer or Eryx) to the gates of hell on earth. This is just another area where the author did not execute her ideas too well. There are several different "species" in this story regarding the spiritual world: humans, anabo, mephisto, demons, skia, god, ghosts (aka "purgs", short for purgatory), and then some. I did my best to follow, but you can't help but end up a little confused as to how all these different characters match up and what their abilities and purposes are. This part of the story was not well organized.Still, The Mephisto Covenant makes for an interesting enough read. You can follow along enough to know what is going on, and there is still some thrill here and there. There is the supernatural side of the story as well as a plot line involving the CIA, spies, and Russia. The main characters, Sasha and Jax, were unfortunately very hard for me to get a grip on. I really wanted to love the romantic & exciting details of their unique relationship, but I just kept growing frustrated that I couldn't relate to them. I just didn't care about either of them that much, and as a reader, I sort of think that's an author's JOB. To get you to care about the heroine and hero. There is very little to be said for Sasha's personality (perhaps the downside of jumping in so quickly in chapter one?), and unfortunately the book seems to tell the reader that Jax falls for her, not for who she is, but what she is and what she can do for him. He appreciates her looks, her being anabo, but never really seems to care about the person she is. Not that I know, as the reader, what sort of person she is, the book doesn't really get that deep. Some readers might not care, but that just doesn't do it for me in the romance department.Finally, and this starts some SPOILER material here, so read at your own risk: There is a sex scene in this book which is pretty darn graphic for a YA book. I've read some romantic novels that had similar (and more graphic) scenes, but this was the first time I've encountered this in a YA category book. The author doesn't skirt around the act carefully as I've seen a few other YA authors do, she gets right down to business and goes into more detail than that. Now, I will keep my personal beliefs to myself - whether you think it's appropriate for a YA book that you or your teen reads to have a sex scene in it is a decision only you can make. That said, I just think it's fair to warn those thinking about reading it that this book does boldly cross the line that so many other YA authors have carefully danced on for years now.Furthermore, what I will admit bothers me about the intimate scene is that, due to Sasha being "anabo" and Jax being "mephisto", their having sex involves Sasha being "marked" by Jax when they sleep together. As a book for young women, I just am not sure I'm cool with that idea, even if it's just fiction. When we are set up to like the hero and heroine and find their story romantic - to take it one step further like that and make the sex scene (for teen readers, no less) revolve around Jax "marking" Sasha as if she is his possession is just not working for me. As a mother myself (to very small children, luckily I don't have to worry about sex scenes in books... yet) I'm not sure I like the idea of my teen daughter reading a romantic story in which the hero ends up "marking" the heroine's body via sex. I don't like that message, whatever it is. But again, reader beware, use your own discretion.All things considered, yes I would say this book was at the least and entertaining read with a unique plot (for a supernatural teen romance book). Unfortunately it fell short in the way the author executed it, and I had a hard time caring about it's characters. I can't recommend it as a good read, but I won't tell you to completely avoid it either.

$REVIEW.: &#8220;Country Love&#8221; is a romantic suspense novella about a country music DJ at a radio station and an up-and-coming singer.Paden Thomas loves radio, and she&#8217;s been dreaming of a shot at a major market&#8212;so when she gets chance to host a show in Nashville, she jumps at it. She doesn&#8217;t expect to find love there, but she does with CJ Tanner, the handsome singer in The Caf&eacute; Cowboys. Soon, they&#8217;ve embarked on a relationship marked with physical thrill and emotional connection. However, their love is marred by a string of events including vandalism that target both CJ and Paden&#8212;and though they seem perfect for each other and meant to be, it becomes too dangerous to be together.I love romances that are either Western or have Western themes, so I was excited about &#8220;Country Love.&#8221; I also thought it was a unique twist that Paden worked at a country music station; the setting of Nashville makes the story a lot more modern-feeling than romances set on ranches or in the countryside. As a whole, I enjoyed this book and liked the general storyline&#8212;there is plenty of well-written sensuality between Paden and CJ, and there&#8217;s also a good amount of suspense. I also liked that Roxanne isn&#8217;t one-dimensional when she could have been&#8212;instead she has a backstory that gave you empathy for her and made her a more well-rounded character.I do think there was room for development in this story, as the author just tells you about certain things that are happening instead of letting the action and the dialogue show you. For instance, Paden is drawn to CJ right away&#8212;but without hearing the banter in the interview, you can&#8217;t tell exactly why. Paden&#8217;s boss and his obsession with her also could have been fleshed out a lot more to add suspense as well as depth to his character.However, if you love romance and erotica, especially with a Western flair, I would recommend &#8220;Country Love&#8221; as a quick, fun read.

$REVIEW.: Much like the main character each book is progressively worse.  The grammar and spelling continue to degrade as the story itself becomes a slog through nearly mind numbing material.  Considering the books have been so short it's more of a slap in the face to read through the hum drum of it all.  Medical reports can be more thrilling.  Nor is it very fun to start a book on such a slow pace and continue to punish the main character to the point that he's been seriously and severely maimed to the point that I wonder if there will be anything of him left by the end.Giving it a one star because the last book got a 2.

I loved 5 Feet or Less!One of my favorite things about this book was the incorporation of SO many of the other MOTS characters that I have grown to love!I can relate to Reese in that I am not the most outgoing and sociable person; I deal much better with computers than with people. I loved that, much like myself, Reese found someone that helped break her out of that shell and get out and live in the world again.One of the things I love about all the MOTS books is that I really connected with the characters and this book was no different!

$REVIEW.: The author explores the belief that every word has power, thus your thoughts, what you say to yourself & others has positive or negative power. This is a concept I believe in wholeheartedly & use in my practice as a board certified hypnotherapist. Create an awareness of & choose the words you say to yourself & others wisely & you will change your energy & your life. I love the index included for recommendations of what phrases to use instead of.  Example-no problem. Using the word problem infers trouble. A simple 'You're welcome' is much higher positive energy. For years I have substituted the word challenge for problem with amazing results- Much lighter emotional energy around any obstacles or disappointments.

$review_text.: **3.5 stars****I was gifted a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.**Initially I felt that the connection between Elizabeth and Carter moved far too fast - I wasn't sure that I found it credible. This then became more believable as it progressed into a sexy yet sweet love story. Elizabeth and Carter are two individuals still struggling to deal with betrayals in their individual pasts, betrayals which have left parts of them quite broken and unwilling to trust. Yet these very same betrayals also causes them to share a soulful connection which makes them fit together like long-lost pieces of the same puzzle. While they both had trust issues, I liked that they didn't retreat to past relationships (cheating, dishonesty) - and while it was at times frustrating for the reader to deal with the long brooding silences, eventually one is rewarded with their ability to finally overcome their issues and commit to one another completely.I enjoyed the dual POV's, as well as Carter's passion for his career. While I did not care for the Sandy storyline, I can see that it was necessary to move parts of Carter's dad's storyline along - primarly his redemption towards the end.Thank you for the opportunity to review this book! :)

$review_text.: Author: Karen KondazianISBN: 9781601823021Publisher: Hansen Publishing GroupIf you happen to visit the Pioneer Odd Fellows Cemetery in Watsonville, California, you may come across the grave of Charley Darkey Parkhurst (1812-1879) with the following curious inscription on the tombstone:Charley Darkey Parkhurst (1812-1879) Noted whip of the gold rush days drove stage over Mt. Madonna in early days of Valley. Last run San Juan to Santa Cruz. Death in cabin near the 7 mile house. Revealed 'one eyed Charlie' a woman. First woman to vote in the U.S. November 3, 1868No doubt, you are now asking what is this all about? And most likely Karen Kondazian, before writing her debut novel The Whip, likewise posed the same question when she began her research in re-creating the life and times of this unusual stagecoach driver or whip, as they were called, who masqueraded as a man in California for several decades.Inspired by a true story, the narrative rivets you with such profound twists and turns, that it hardly lets up over the course of its 292 pages. Kondazian has certainly done her homework as evidenced by her ability to unveil the audacious character of Charley as depicted through the various phases and episodes of her life. In addition, she has effectively captured this gritty era of guns, whiskey and horses that by the time you have completed your reading, the realism and emotions will make you believe that it is all true.The first stage of Charley's life, who initially is known as Charlotte, unfolds when in March of 1812 in Boston, Massachusetts, her mother abandons her as a baby on the steps of the Boston Society for Destitute Children. It is here where she is befriended by a boy of four, Lee Colton, who takes on the role of her protector against the beastliness she encounters at the hands of the head mistress of the institution. Lee, however, is not exactly a great role model and is quite a nasty fellow, whom Charlotte never completely trusted. Her instincts ultimately prove justified when Lee rapes her and it is this tragic experience that will have a significant role in determining the course of her future life.When the head mistress discovers that Charlotte likes to play with boys, she punishes her by having her live in the stables as a stable hand and to tend to one of the most difficult horses. Moreover, the headmistress tells her in front of Jonas, the regular stable boy, that "everything that goes into that horse, and everything that comes out is your responsibility. If he is difficult, if he disobeys...you, not her, are to be punished." Under the tutelage of Jonas, who was like a father to her, Charlotte succeeds in her role as stable hand as well as learning the tricks of the trade in driving a wagon that one day will have an immense influence on her life.Charlotte's life embraces a new direction when Jonas dies and she meets and falls in love with Bryon Williams, a black man who is a blacksmith. After their relationship ends in a sad and horrendous event, Charlotte decides to pursue the life of a stragecoach driver in Sacramento, California. However, there is one problem, she is a woman and it is inconceivable that women would be permitted entry into this occupation. Nonetheless, this doesn't deter a feisty Charlotte who decides to disguise herself as a man, never to reveal to anyone her true gender. In fact, you can say that she becomes an actor forced to live a life of cruel deception yet at the same time becoming one of the most renowned stagecoach drivers of her time- making us all wonder how was she able to pull this off for so many years?The Whip is a powerful, utterly memorable and auspicious debut authored from someone that I am sure we will be hearing more about in the future. Kondazian's astute understanding of character and dialogue can presumably be attributed to her many years as an award- winning theatre actress and her more than fifty television shows and films. And if you find yourself reading this novel believing that you can easily predict what will happen next, watch out. You are in for a big surprise.

$REVIEW.: I am still immersed in this book. I like the layout, the well done 30 color plates that are arranged landscape style, 3 planes per page covering a wide model variety of USAF, VNAF, RAAF B-57s and B 20s. Excellent choice of plate subjects: camos, natural metal, early, late models and even a weather plane! Very well done! I like what author T.E. Bell did with this book. I felt he put his heart into this work. Photos are in crisp color and the black and white photos are very acceptable and relevant with most very crisp. First off, I have not read the entire book yet because my refrigerator quit and I had to deal with that! But from what I have read so far I particularly liked the chapters titled 'The Doom Pussy' (about the Da Nang Officers Open Mess - aka DOOM - and its cat mascot - aka, well you know) and 'Enter the Dragon' on page 82. I worked A-6E TRAM in the Navy and in 'Enter the Dragon' Bell describes the electronics on the B-57G and difficulties with new LGB bomb delivery. The workaround crews used for successful delivery of the LGBs must have been hair raising for B-57G crews! Great stuff! Book includes a half page appendice detailing all B-57 and B 20 Canberra losses (date, variant & serial number, cause) in SE Asia 1964-71. I also loved the RAAF section (8 pages 2 color plates) I didn't realize they were so revered for their bombing accuracy -interesting story on that. And what's with those crazy RAAF wingtip bomb racks!!? So do I like this book?-oh yeah one of my all time favorites- and I have done a lot of reviews. I don't know why but I had to have this book (unusual subject appealed to me I guess) but I pre-ordered it from Amazon.  I was not upset with my purchase and highly recommend this book for not only the stunning artwork depicted (again!) by Jim Laurier (cover is absolutely stunning) but by the exceptional story telling and layout of the book. Thanks Mr. Bell, you won me over with your style and I look forward to your next offering-please don't stop! Bravo Zulu.

 This book sets up several twists and turns in the storyline that you know will come back in future books
 It was good to read how things worked out for Ryne

 And just when you thought Marla was gone

$review_text.: This could have been the subtitle for this book. I like Brett Battles, enjoy the Jonathon Quinn series a lot. In this book he starts out with strong character development and an immediately likable Logan Harper. He reintroduces and old friend in this book which was a nice surprise.  Harper identifies the bad guys and literally the next three quarters of the book (on a kindle from about 30% into the book until about 83% into the book) is a series of chases. Literally by plane,truck, boat, train and car. Literally. By then I didn't even care if they caught them. Unreal.  Very frustrating. It dragged the story line to a complete halt for me. When it finally ended? Not worth the wait.

$REVIEW.: Imagine you are in Hell, sitting at a desk and taking an exam, as the Devil himself watches over you. Here, Hell is what you think and dream it to be, and the Devil is just as crafy as reputation claims. I really enjoyed this metaphor of there being one more test, one more chance to outwit the Devil at his own game, and one more chance to prove yourself, one way or the other.Life is full of choices, and this short story is about the chance and the choice to become something better than you are, or failing the test and dooming yourself to give the Devil his due time and again. I always enjoy a story where that divine spark of hope shines, even in the most ignoble of people. And here, in this smart and thoughtful story, there was really a nice feeling to that idea of redemption being within reach, even when Death has put you in a place where there is very little hope.

$REVIEW.: The Maverick Experiment is decent story about a team of CIA sponsored rogue contractors led by a man named Derek Stevens. Derek is a former Company Black Ops Operative called in for a new type of team, a group of former Tier 1 Operators (Special Forces) that operate by the same rules the terrorists do, none. Derek and his team are trained and dropped into Afghanistan to create all kinds of havoc for the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. The team gets on the ground intelligence and acts on its own without red tape. Ops include assassination, kidnapping and other page turning actions. The book presents an interesting yet troubling spin, what if we took the leash off our dogs of war? There is quite a bit of moral ambiguity as some of their casualties are innocent bystanders taken out to achieve the tactical advantage. All in all, this was a good book. A little slow at first, as the author spells out things for those with no military background, but when the team sets down in Afghanistan, the excitement ramps up. The book also is a little short for my taste. The action gets intense then ends abruptly. Either way a good freshman offering and I look forward to reading more about Derek and his team in the future.

$review_text.: Psychologist Mick Callahan has a knack for getting into trouble


A recovering alcoholic, womanizer and fighter (as a child his stepfather forced him to fight for money), he's now on the straight and narrow after barely escaping his last scrape with his life (the events of Shannon's previous novel, Memorial Day)
In fact, things are finally looking up; he's got a pretty young girlfriend and a new hit radio talk show.But when Callahan and his date are mysteriously assaulted in the parking lot by a huge tattooed man wearing a black mask, and his housekeeper's adopted son is kidnapped, it seems that trouble has once again found him
Things quickly get worse: an old friend, drug addict and prostitute named Mary calls him with a plea for help, and he can't resist going after her.The problem is, Mary has fallen in with a very bad group of people, and Callahan quickly finds himself swept up into a dangerous plot
Nothing is as it seems, and he must call in every favor and use every ounce of his strength and cunning to stay alive
Assault, prostitution and child pornography are par for the course as Shannon's taut thriller moves with lightning speed to a thrilling conclusion.Shannon's prose is effortless as he propels the story along with the practiced ease of a master
There's enough intrigue and plot twists to keep any reader interested, but the real hook of this novel is Callahan himself.Eye of the Burning Man is, in a word, astonishingly good


This novel is lean, dark and one hell of a lot of fun

Although it's not necessary to read Shannon's previous Callahan novel, Memorial Day, it's worth doing so, if only to see the character change and grow from one book to the next
Callahan is more than an echo of the hard-boiled sleuths from other standout detective series from Parker, Crais, MacDonald and Thompson; he is a fresh new voice, a flawed everyman hero who knows his own demons and his own limitations and is strong enough to overcome.Put simply, Eye of the Burning Man stands with some of the very best noir mystery fiction around

Shannon deserves a much wider audience for this series, and one can only hope he will land a mass-market deal so that many more readers can become acquainted with Mick Callahan Highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: Colleen Coble never disappoints when she writes. She is one of my favorite authors. This is the First book in the Under Texas Stars series. Every series Colleen Coble does is different from the previous, and that is one of the things I love about her books. She is such a versatile writer.Lucy's father dies suddenly and she is left to take care of her younger brother and sister. Set in 1877 Lucy is left with few options as a woman. When Henry arrives at her doorstep and claims to be a friend of her father with a solution to her problems, she has no choice but to listen to his proposal. It literally turned out to be a proposal, not for himself, but for his son, Nate. With no other choice, she became Nate's wife by proxy. When she shows up at the ranch with Henry, Nate does not know this young woman is his wife but thinks she is after his dad's money.As Nate and Lucy begin their life together as man and wife, they have much to learn about each other. Will they ever have the kind of relationship that each of them wanted to have when they would marry someone?I would definitely recommend this book to anyone. It was a great read with characters that drew me into the story line. Thanks Colleen Coble for delivering yet again a novel that is well worth reading.

It's interesting that the show and the novels aren't exactly the same. Almost like an alternate universe. The books are a good way to bridge the gap between seasons of the show, but if you are a fast reader, order several at a time.

$review_text.: My son, age 6, and I really enjoyed this book.  It is great to see the same scene throughout the seasons with many views have walls taken away so you can see inside of buildings.  My only complaint is that the author put these two sentences in the introduction...... "As you read, look for people that appear each month. Look especially for the farmer, her husband, their three children, and Grandma and Grandpa"So the gender roles are switched with the wife as the farmer, and the husband having a lesser role on several of the pages.  In my experience, today most farms have both the husband and wife doing the farm roles equally and both describing themselves as "farmers".  I just don't understand some authors wanting to put the female in the "lead" roles in books like these.However, if you don't read the introduction page, you probably would not even notice that the "farmer" is a woman instead of a man, because you have such a high up view of the farm.  It just bothers me a little that the life on a farm is portrayed that way.I still give this 4 stars because the concept is wonderful, the illustrations are fun to look at, and unless you carefully read the introduction, you probably may never even catch this gender role reversal.

$review_text.: So, so happy to have the chance to tell you about these two short novellas (The Scribe, The Handler) that go along with the Mindjack Series by Susan Quinn.  I have reviewed the first two novels, Open Minds and Closed Hearts on my blog. I loved them.I just love when authors give us these novellas.  For me, it serves two roles.  First, it feeds me need to read more in between the actual full length novels.  A little snack at intermission.  :)  Second, it gives me a glimpse into the lives, emotions and history of individual characters.  It's awesome.  Now I love Julian and Sasha even more.These two novellas are fantastic.  Julian and Sasha are both introduced in book two of this series and if you have read book two you will be wondering about them both.  I sure was.  Your heart will break just a little for Sasha.  Well, maybe a lot.My thanks to Susan Quinn for allowing me a chance to read and review these novellas.  Love, love, love.  I cannot wait to read the next installment in the Mindjack series, Free Souls.

He seemed a natural story-teller and so I guessed his book would be as pleasurable to read as his talk was to listen to.  It is, and then some.  He teaches creative writing, and it shows.  His brief review of good old DST is as crisp as a mid-summer dawn and as reassuring as that night's sunset, the times of both distorted by DST.  Great summer read.  And why not, you do have an extra hour to devote to it.

$REVIEW.: If you are a fan of the quirky, snarky and clever characters that Eve Langlais writes, then this will be your next must-read from her. Trust me, there is little to NOT like about this book: characters, sex, humor, a twisty demon-centric murder mystery and more sex.I was so excited to get the opportunity to read this title, a first-person narration provided by the heroine, Chloe who just would be a fun friend! Chloe is a lawyer who works in the public defender&#8217;s office. The world has morphed and polygamist relationships are legal, werewolves are now members of the known society, and Chloe is bemoaning her lack of men willing to follow her no strings attached rules when it comes to sex. See, Chloe had a bad relationship, her commitment-phobic self nearly plunged into the &#8220;M&#8221; word: Move In, with a man who was sharing his delights with another.Her best friend is her polar opposite in every respect: tiny, bold and adventurous, Brenda is always trying to get Chloe, all 6 feet of her, to live on the wild side, especially after Pete appears for a pre-trial meeting. His charges? Digging holes in the neighbor&#8217;s yard, peeing on her bushes and terrorizing her cat. See a theme? Pete is a werewolf, and his neighbor is a witch, with a cat familiar that terrorizes his lovebirds.If that&#8217;s not enough to intrigue, there is Anthony, the prosecuting attorney that Chloe seems always to encounter, and never has beaten in court. Both Anthony and Pete stir her attraction, but being gun-shy, Chloe isn&#8217;t willing to get into a relationship. Yet, these two leave her no choice. Aided and cheered on by her BFF, she finds herself acting on her attraction to these two, and their connections are steamy, inventive and oh so sexy! It doesn&#8217;t help when your Mum, your two Dads and your BFF are all proponents of poly relationships, and are willing to dissect your relationship down to the last detail: I can&#8217;t decide if she spent more time blushing or fantasizing (which made her blush again).Chloe is clever and funny, with a habit of speaking first and thinking later, much to a reader&#8217;s delight. The banter and interior monologues are laugh out loud, spit iced coffee over your eReader funny, and even more so when she absentmindedly speaks those thoughts. Her character is utterly delightful and fun and the interactions with both Pete and Anthony are so deliciously drawn and developed that they all come alive as you read. Another winner from Eve Langlais &#8211; I will be curious to see if this story stands at just one installment or if we are destined to see more of Chloe and the boyz later on.I received an eArc from the author for purpose of Beta Reading/honest review. I was not compensated for this review: all conclusions are my own responsibility.

$review_text.: This started out really well, and went downhill quickly.  The ending was truly awful.The premise is pretty great, actually!  The characters, though, are very poorly developed and I had no empathy for any of them at all.  Many descriptions and explanations are just boring.  In parts it's very poorly copy-edited.  There are also several, paragraphs, of, lists, of, things, that, you, don't, care, about.  Tedious.By the end I hoped they'd just get eaten and it'd be over with finally.There are a lot of great ideas in this book and you can see the writer struggling to flesh them out but sadly, he fails.  Hoping for better work from the same author in the future, clearly some good ideas up there, just needs to figure out how to write in an engaging style.

$REVIEW.: Dos sugerencias a eventuales lectores: 1) Es altamente conveniente leer primero &#34;En el pa&iacute;s de la nube blanca&#34;, de la misma autora, sin perjuicio de lo cual el presente libro es una obra completa en s&iacute; misma. 2)Tambi&eacute;n es conveniente leer antes de comenzar, las notas del final, donde  la autora aclara qu&eacute; cosas han sucedido realmente, y da otras claves para la mejor comprensi&oacute;n del libro.Lark escribe con una fluidez magn&iacute;fica, eficaz tanto en la acci&oacute;n como en la descripci&oacute;n. El lector pasa una buena temporada trajinando por la isla Sur de Nueva Zelanda, a veces a caballo, otras en carreta, inc&oacute;modo pero interesado en la peripecia de los personajes.Maor&iacute;es (establecidos en la isla desde el siglo XII) y europeos (desde fines del XVIII y principios del XIX) van estableciendo con esfuerzo relaciones culturales, laborales, territoriales, en general de una forma bastante civilizada, seg&uacute;n la autora.  El tema se plantea con mayor rispidez cuando  el relacionamiento es entre individuos, por ejemplo, la formaci&oacute;n de parejas interraciales, donde la carga cultural de cada uno es el 50 % del problema, y donde la actitud de las familias tambi&eacute;n pesa.El libro es atrapante, entretenido, informativo, bien documentado. Es interesante el proceso de introducci&oacute;n de la m&aacute;quina de coser Singer, y c&oacute;mo e lvendedor era un verdadero pionero, realizando sus recorridos en condiciones precarias, durmiendo en establos cuando hab&iacute;a suerte. Tambi&eacute;n la descripci&oacute;n de un pueblo minero del siglo XIX, ubicado muy lejos de los centros de la miner&iacute;a del carb&oacute;n, como Inglaterra y Alemania. Todo lo anterior se ve realzado por el hilo conductor que son los personajes, que no escapan a ninguna de las dificultades o durezas del entorno. P&aacute;rrafo aparte merece  el tema al que se refiere el t&iacute;tulo, la m&uacute;sica maor&iacute;. Sus armon&iacute;as y ritmos probablemente nos resulten tan extra&ntilde;os como los de la m&uacute;sica de China y Jap&oacute;n, con la cual tenemos una incipiente relaci&oacute;n a trav&eacute;s del cine. Nos resulta familiar el famoso &#34;haka&#34;, que los equipos neozelandeses de rugby  ejecutan antes de comenzar los juegos que vemos por televisi&oacute;n.En resumen, es un libro que no defrauda, Lejos de ello, entretiene e informa.
$SUMMARY.: Excelente, Entretenido e informativo.

$REVIEW.: I recently read The Secrets Lives of Husbands and Wives by Josie Brown. I was pleasantly surprised by what a good read it was by an author that I had never heard about before. I was thrilled to discover that she had written other books and I was certainly intrigued by this title.In this story, we find that Donna has lost her husband. Needing to support her three children, she becomes an assassin for a government organization. The book is funny, entertaining, fast moving, and a thriller. You do become invested in the characters and at points like and dislike the same character. Josie has a gift for writing an engaging, truly enjoyable novel. I will be looking for my next one!

$review_text.: This fantasy book, the first in a trilogy, introduces us to an unlikely hero, The Pan of Hamgee. The Pan is a young person living under a despotic regime, who has managed to remain uncaptured for 5 years (the average is a month or so) by dint of being a devout coward. His specialism is running away. We meet many other memorable characters, Big Merv (a Swamp Thing and The Pan's employer) and the wonderful elderly lady keepers of the local tavern (and Their Trev). There is a fabulous section towards the end where The Pan is fighting off a strong dose of Truth Drug which had me laughing aloud at times.The writing was clever, witty, wickedly good in places and the story kept me turning (clicking?) page after page when I should have gone to bed! The Pan is a wonderful character and one I look forward to reading more about. He is destined for higher things (if he can keep his tongue under control!) An excellent story, well told.

$review_text.: Christine Amsden's second novel, The Immortality Virus, raises an intriguing question:  Is it really all that wonderful to find the secret of immortality and live forever?It's the 21st century and the world is being ruled by The Establishment, a totalitarian government made of an elite few
People don't age anymore
As a result, overpopulation has created poverty, hunger, violence, and chaos


People don't even have empathy for their fellow human beings anymore and cruelty and murder abound


Only the elite few can afford to eat normal food; the rest feed on suspicious, high-protein nutri-bars believed to be made up of human flesh.At the beginning of the story, our feisty 130-year old PI protagonist, Grace Harper, is hired to complete a mission: she must discover the whereabouts of Jordan Lacklin, the scientist responsible for the `virus' that started The Change about 400 years ago while working on the cure for Alzheimer's

The secret mission puts Grace's life in danger
On one side, there are those who want to undo The Change to improve the quality of life and the world; on the other side, there are those who want to keep living forever because they have the means to live in luxury..

and they'll go to extremes to make sure Grace doesn't complete her mission.The Immortality Virus is an entertaining, dystopian/science fiction novel with an interesting premise
Grace Harper is a sympathetic, kick-ass heroine: strong, spirited and opinionated
She also has a kind heart that stands out in the cruel society she inhabits


I personally loved her witty comebacks and quirky sense of humor


Although the story gets a bit slow somewhere around the middle, Amsden offers enough action, twists and turns to keep most readers turning the pages

The dialogue is crisp and natural and helps to keep the pace moving
Amsden uses a lot of dialogue and action scenes, and keeps description and narration at a minimum


She also throws in a bit of romance for good measure

I also enjoyed the way she depicts the future, presenting us with a grim and realistic glimpse of what society could become as a result of greed and medical technology


If you love dystopian novels with strong heroines and you're attracted to the subject of immortality, I recommend you give this one a try.

$REVIEW.: Mogadishu Diaries Bloodlines, Author Eddie Clay IIII was mildly surprised as I read the diaries which are based on true events but written as fiction for the timeline of 1992-1993, and set primarily in Mogadishu

Author Eddie Clay III has written a book which is easy to read, concise with the details, and holds your interest

I know the book is a work of fiction, but I was able to read the diary entries and feel I was there with Gunnery Sergeant Thompson as the country was torn with civil war between rival clan leaders wanting power, and street gangs thieving, raping, and killing people.In the book, The Mogadishu Diaries, the author tells of an "Operation Restore Hope" program approved by the UN


Resolution 794 was a way to facilitate humanitarian aid to the starving and war ravaged Somalis


The US and coalition troops were authorized to help secure supply routes for relief aid, such as food, and medical or first aid supplies


In preparation for this duty, Gunnery Sergeant Thompson feels compelled to have Corporal Ramirez, who is the best marksman in the unit join this operation
The two men are finding unexpected obstacles as they proceed to volunteer for this tour of service
Corporal Ramirez is not acknowledged with the respect he is due among other authority figures


Gunnery Sergeant Thompson does not follow the path of least resistance without taking action to bring notice to Corporal Ramirez and his abilities.I have watched and read news accounts and other books regarding the suffering and cruel treatment of the Somalia people

I am very empathetic for these people and children who have been trapped in the middle of rogue fighting between selfish leaders and also the roving gangs and thugs who have preyed upon them

I suppose I was expecting another heart-rending accounting of the horrific condition of the poor and starving, but The Mogadishu Diaries are a different view from the heart and mind of a Gunnery Sergeant.I will not write any spoilers in this review, but the diaries will give the reader an armchair view of some problems in our military hierarchy or chain of command, and also you will feel the heat of a battle which has your heart beating faster than normal !

$REVIEW.: 4.5 StarsThis book drew me in from the first page. I couldn't put this book down. I wanted to know what was going to happen with Lexie, Finn and Mollie.Lexie is an amazingly strong woman. She met Dex when she was 20 and she thought he was the love of her life. Then after the first year he started hitting her. It just kept escalating. When she was ready to leave she found out she was pregnant and she thought things would change. Finally she decided to go on the run. Her best friend Mollie goes on the run with her. She will do anything to make Finn have the best life she can give him. Finn and Mollie are the reason she is still alive! The last thing Lexie wants is to fall in love. Will she let Lukas into Finn and her life?"Haunted, yet so beautiful, and you don't even know it, he said. I don't know how that's possible."Lukas is a sexy detective. He is instantly attracted to Lexie. He rescues her from a near rape. He knows she is closing herself off and hiding things. He wants to keep her safe but she keeps fighting it. He instantly falls in love with Finn too. He will do anything to get Lexie and Finn in his life!"You haven't got it through that stubborn head of yours, but you're mine Lexi and I'm not letting you go. Fight it all you want baby, but what's between us is real and you are here with me; same as Finn."This book is a definite must read! It not only keeps you wanting more of Lexie, Finn and Lukas, but also from all the secondary characters. Which is good because this is going to be a series!!!

$review_text.: It's really nice to find a YA novel that focuses much more on interesting characters and the fascinating relationship dynamics between peers - rather than the usual angsty love triangle (roll eyes). This book was a great, fast read and would especially appeal to teenage boys, I think. I love how each of the characters had unique voices - and how the author was able to make me care for them - despite the fact the the lines between &#34;good&#34; and &#34;evil&#34; had become a bit blurred and you learn things about some characters that should make you recoil in horror - but somehow, Whibley makes them so &#34;human&#34; that you care about them and find it hard to judge blindly. There are some descriptions of violence but it is all in keeping with the storyline and not gratuitous at all. I think my favourite character was Juno - for some reason, I kept seeing him as a young, teenage version of Agent Zero from the Wolverine movies! :-) Overall, a really enjoyable read!

$REVIEW.: I remember when I read my first Laird Barron story, "Catch Hell", in Ellen Datlow's Lovecraft Unbound. When I finished reading the final page, I placed the book down, logged onto my Amazon account, and ordered his first story collection. A few days later it arrived, and I've been a fan ever since, devouring his second collection and novella when they were published.With this in mind, it's fair to say that expectations were very high for The Croning. It's also fair to say that Mr. Barron not only meets those expectations, he beats them. He beats them bloody.I've always been wary of the "perfect" review, but there really isn't much to find wrong with this novel. The plot comes together beautifully, the characters are very well realized, and the sense of dread pulsing in the background and steadily growing until the climax can only be done by a master. If this author's stories gave you nightmares, than this novel will take it a step further and give you all out night terrors.This book would be a great start for anyone new to Barron's work, and will give an idea of how talented he is. Fans of anything reminiscent of Lovecraft's works or themes must read Barron. There's no question about it. Even fans of horror in general should pick this book up; what's between the covers will terrify anyone. Lastly, anyone who is already a Barron fan will be overjoyed by this novel. It's also great fun spotting all the connections to his other stories, which help to further his own horrifying "mythos".Now that I'm finished I find myself re-reading all his short stories and eagerly awaiting more new fiction!

$REVIEW.: I was given an advance copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.I am a Tess Thompson fan. I have read all of her books, and always eagerly await the next one, so I was very excited to read an early copy of Tea and Primroses.  Ms. Thompson did not disappoint. I read this book during a cross-country flight. I was actually hoping to get some sleep on the plane, but I couldn't because I found this book impossible to put down.This is a bit of a departure in story-telling style from her recent books - it is really a story within a story. But that device worked really well, and I had to keep reading to see what was going to happen next, with both sets of characters.Tea and Primroses, at its heart, is about love. But not just romantic love, though there is that. It's also about the relationship between a mother and daughter, and for me, that was even more compelling to read about than anything else in the book.  I was so touched by the parent/child relationships in the book, I welled up. TWICE. I am a voracious reader, and I can only think of 2 other books that brought me to tears. (And one of those was Marley and Me, where *spoiler alert* the dog dies in the end.)So, if you have read Ms. Thompson's other works, you will love this book. Even if you haven't, you will love this book.  I'm not a writer, so my words are not as beautifully put together as Ms. Thompson's. But trust me. This book is excellent. I can't wait to read what she writes next!

$REVIEW.: The Marx Brothers were comedic geniuses! Harpo said a mouthful with only his eyes and a honk or two; Chico did used poor grammar to make you pay attention; Zeppo joined Gummo's successful talent agent agency so you will rarely see Zeppo on screen and never (as I understand it) see Gummo, though there are pictures of all brothers in the book.Groucho stole the show. He was the emcee on You Bet Your Life: The show that began: Say the secret word and you win $25.My favorite interview from that show was from a man who had (I think) 8 children. Groucho was appalled. If his mustache could have spun around, it would have.The man playing You Bet Your Life defended himself by saving, "I love my wife."Groucho quickly replied, " I love my cigar, but I take it out of my mouth occasionally."That was more than forty years ago, so please forgive my rusty memory.I did, however, sit up nights to watch Groucho on You Bet Your Live. Groucho would sometimes seem to steer his contestants towards the secret word, especially (it seemed to my young mind), if they wore wore a uniform, any kind of uniform!Only one of the Marx Brothers served in WWI. Their family had (luckily) emigrated from Germany before their sons were born. You can read the book to get the details of that and the many divorces another brother suffered through.If all you know about the Marx brothers comes from their zany movies, this book will open your eyes to the other parts of their lives.

$review_text.: Boy! I ordered this book thinking that it was a discussion of military tactics and strategy in the Renaissance era
However, it is (via a subtitle): "Wargaming rules for Renaissance tabletop gaming."This is really a handbook of wargaming the era


I know absolutely nothing about wargaming, but came to learn a fair amount in the process of looking at this book; I also learned something about actual military tactics and strategy of the time
The author of the book, Richard Bodley Scott, describes its purpose thus (Page 14): "This book is designed both to explain the game and be a reference guide when playing."A reference section at the end of the book is useful at laying out operational details of wargaming.My head was spinning while going through this book, given my lack of knowledge of wargaming


But it was a fascinating journey!

They are very well written and have many twists and turns that will make anyone that is a serious mystery story reader a book that will satisfy them. I am going to see if there are any more of the Windsor series NOVELS so that I can read them.

$review_text.: My Review:I love romances where the hero and heroine have a history of friendship. That is definitely the case between Chaili and Marc, but they've drifted apart over the last few years as Marc has become more successful as a musician and Chaili realized that her love for him would never be returned. Marc is an artistic guy...despite his fame, his pretty socially awkward. As a result, he uses his sister's escort service to gain dates for nights out on the town that he has to participate in. The set-up for this book was that his normal date cancelled on him at the last moment, so he went to his sister. Chaili happened to be there when he set up the date and volunteered, although Marc didn't realize it until he picked her up.While Marc and she have been friends, Marc has been pretty self-absorbed and honestly has no idea what has gone on in Chaili's life the last few years...and those have not been happy years for her. As he realizes what he's missed out again, he is also discovering a brand new draw to her that he's never felt before.The book is called Beautiful Scars and while Chaili has the physical scars...that part of the story line was a surprise to me and I really liked the beauty that occurred between the two of them because of him showing her how beautiful she still is. But she's not the only one scarred...Marc is, too...emotionally. He's been betrayed before because of his fame and as a result, is very reluctant to let anyone into his world. He has a really difficult time opening up. It certainly doesn't help that with his social awkwardness, he tends to stick his foot in it when he does try to open up.Overall, the book was about recovery...especially mental recovery from scarring left from bad relationships and learning to love again. Learning to be open mentally for emotional attachments again. I thought it was a beautiful story with an incredible message. I enjoyed the book and especially loved the musician's slant to the story line and the entire back story behind Chaili's scarring. It made for a great read.

$REVIEW.: Bob the Zombie a wonderful story that takes place in a world where Zombies, werewolves, necromancers, ghouls, witches, etc (I could go on & on) are part of the everyday norm
Bob is a zombie brought back after a "Griswaldian" accident by a distraught mother through a necromancer,  who then no longer wants her son around once he starts rotting
I feel brainless writing the word "heartwarming" in a book titled Bob the Zombie
But that is what you get, a wonderfully funny yet heartwarming tale that will have you laughing out loud one minute and then feeling heart break for our fun loving protagonist in this well crafted story.Jaime Johnesee is one of those rare authors who can actually inject humor & cynicism into her story without it feeling forced


 A fun read that I recommend and that I plan on reading multiple times

Just like Donkey Kong, this book has great replay value.

$REVIEW.: Charles Nelson was a legend, and he had a fan club composed of some of the most seriously tough and experienced self defense experts in the world (including Carl Cestari, who by the time of his death had forgotten more than we will every know).The intro to the book has a cool story about a smart kid who was going to show the old guy a thing or two and wound up eating carpet.With a story like that, I dug in.But the scope of techniques presented in these books is narrow, and the photos are poor quality and small.And some of the choices Nelson made in his demonstrations seemed perfectly okay, and his execution also seemed okay for a very old man in poor condition.But I just can't get enthusiastic about this book. With as much of a rep as Charles Nelson had gained, and as much experience and study as he'd put into self defense, I expected more.I'm going to come back and reread this a few more times, but after a sincere effort I can't recommend it with any enthusiasm.For civilian self defense for a beginner, read all the Tegner books in preference to this book.For military hand to hand combat, read Fairbairn's Get Tough or All In Fighting, or Applegate's Kill or Get Killed, or Cold Steel by Styers (ignore his knife fighting and knife throwing chapters; the rest of the book is very good).But this book, which was put together after Charles Nelson's death, just doesn't do his reputation justice. Either he wasn't a very good teacher (I don't believe that for a moment because too many people say too many good things about him and his teaching) or this book doesn't correctly represent his teaching.Bear in mind that even a good teacher can turn out a not-so-great book.If I find a lot of gold when I re-read this I'll edit this to point it out, But for now, I'd spend my money on a different book.
$SUMMARY.: I really tried to like this book more!

$review_text.: Lucy isn't looking forward to Christmas this year. Who'd want to remember when her dreams were shattered? When Lucy runs into Robert, her ex and his new fiance, only to find out their wedding is in a week, she REALLY isn't looking forward to Christmas anymore. Throwing out that she's got a grand party on the same day seems like a good idea to take her mind off things, but will it work?A year after her heartbreak Lucy still feels the pain from her breakup. Having been with Robert for a very long time she thought she'd found the one only to find out he thought otherwise. I understood and felt her pain; she didn't have a clue he wasn't on the same page and so their breakup was sudden to her at least. I loved how as things changed for Lucy her view towards her past changed as well. Plus Lucy was hurt but never vindictive. Her heart was in the right place. I do wish she hadn't been so hasty to dash when some she discovered something unexpected.I do wish the story had been longer only because the ending felt abrupt to me and I definitely would've loved to read more. One second things were unsettled and the in next instant finished. Beyond that, the story is flawless and perhaps we may get to see more of Lucy, James, and Mimi in the future. I'd like to thank Talli for sending me a copy to review.

$REVIEW.: Alright, if you like ANY of the South Florida genre writers (Shames, Dorsey, Hall Hiiasen, etc.), you're going to enjoy reading Robert Tacoma's wacky novels

 (And the one set in Texas! Sheriff Skunk.)Tacoma's characters can be as wacky as any of the rest, but you're also sitting there reading thinking to yourself how much some of these characters remind you of people you know

 Art imitating life?  And, if these characters could come to life, with all their faults and quirks, where else would they be "normal" than Key West?I highly recommend ALL of Tacoma's novels to any fan of South Florida wacky fiction
 And, hey, the price is right on Amazon too!

$REVIEW.: Daniel Stark software tycoon and previously incapable of loving, has fallen hard for recent college graduate Haley Grace. They've had several fallouts in the beginning of their relationship, but the Daniel is determined that Inner Core opens with the last fallout they'll ever have.He is determined to get her back, and make her his at all costs.Daniel became the perfect book boyfriend in the second half of Part 1, and is keeping up his lovely act throughout Part 2. The problem is that Haley - who started out as someone, nice, fun and down to earth - just couldn't get her insecurities in check. There's a constant back and forth between the two: they break up, the get together, they break up again ... and of course it's all due to stupid misunderstandings.Haley is a real tease (well in the bedroom she's not) and wouldn't know the perfect book boyfriend when it bit her in the bum. And Daniel keeps trying to make it right to her; apologise, make amends and so on and so forth. Lame. He could have shown a little more character.The pace of the story was a tad annoying - it's quite slow and whatever &#34;intrigues&#34; happen along the book, they are insignificant, and the drama they create is out of proportions. The ending was nice, but it didn't strike me as anything spectacular. It felt a bit rushed and too much along the lines of what was &#34;expected&#34;.Also, I was disappointed to find out that Inner Core had lost the fun and hilariousness of Layers. Even though Ian and Tasha - Haley's hilarious friends - did make up for it (a bit).So unfortunately, Inner Core was not really the revelation I expected it to be. The sass and humour that were so entertaining in book 1 are scarce, and the storyline and intriguing events that were already lacking are now... inexistent.Inner Core remains a nice read, but I wouldn't choose this over Colleen Hoover, Abbi Glines or Alice Clayton. At all.

However, the mystery became the exorcist, it was a strange twist and while I liked the mystery parts of the book, I didn't care for the supernatural elements.The book would pick up and get interesting, then once again become bogged down and slow. The premise and writing show a lot of promise, I just am not sure there was a clear vision on what the book should ultimately be.

$review_text.: A new book in the series is the excuse to travel to the other side of the world: India

This country has so many interesting things to learn that make it almost impossible not to enjoy this installment as much as the other books in the series.As I always state, this book presents the perfect opportunity to learn about other cultures with children if you are a teacher (like me) or with the kids in your family.This book, I think, is the most colorful in the series and probably because India is a vibrant and beautiful country
From their spicy food to Bollywood, India has a culture background that never ceases to amaze us.Just so you know, the illustrations are brilliants as always and the writing is superb
Carole has a way to teach us without sounding academic or simple, the words flow naturally engaging the reader from the start.Overall, this book is another great addition to the series

The best educational series about other cultures I had the pleasure to read


It&#8217;s perfect for kids and adults alike.**I received a complimentary copy in exchange of an honest review

I absolutely agree to the fact that binge eating is correlated to emotional eating, and that this correlation should be considered as an alarm or sign for those who are more inclined to either situation.

$REVIEW.: If what you are looking for is story after story after story of peril at sea in the North Atlantic, of 'the staunch little ships and the great-hearted men who struggle with the Western Ocean so that other ships and other men may live', and if you relish 1950s purple prose to ramp up the drama, then you will probably love this book. The stories are told with nearly blow-by-blow detail, with facts, figures, exact dates and times - it is a bit like listening to combat veterans telling their war stories - and that may be exactly what you want.If, however, you are wanting to know, with a good deal of detail, how old steam tugs were operated, you will have to do a considerable amount of digging through all the life-or-death tumult and pathos to find out how steam tugs worked or what they were like on a daily basis. To be fair, this is not, and does not pretend to be, a scholarly work. In fact, the author says in his 1958 introduction that his intention is to tell stories as seen by "the men who actually manned the salvage vessels, rather than those of the vessel's owners." Even so, it must be said that Mowat fails somewhat in that respect, for he tells the stories with very little quoting of, or attribution to, those very real seamen.All in all, however, this is still a book like few others, because there are few books about steam tugs, especially about ocean-going rescue and salvage tugs at the end of the era of steam.

$review_text.: Lawrence's debut novel, Fatal Transaction, is a tense, timely tale that includes such elements as credit card fraud, abuse, runaways and criminals, the IRS and the FBI, and faith.I enjoyed this fast-moving story, as well as the interactions among some of the characters (Derry and Sara, Lamar and everyone). There's a Scottish festival tossed into the plot, and an old electric chair that's put to diabolical use. A major character must pay for her crimes, but readers will be glad she's on the side of "the good guys" -- and I understand she's going to be featured in the next novel. Whoo Hoo!Faith is present, though not heavy-handed or preachy, but there's also violence, which may make some readers squeamish. Still, it's not gratuitous, and it reinforces the vileness of the villain. There's good pacing, too: plenty of suspense and cat-and-mouse action to keep the reader guessing, but also calmer scenes where the reader can catch his breath.I'm looking forward to this author's next novel.Recommended reading.

$REVIEW.: If you are familiar with this product, it is genuine American Girl. The mini dolls aren't as cute as the 18 dolls, but we just ordered this to add to our collection. It is not a good substitute to an 18 inch doll. Not one to &#34;play&#34; with...more for the collector than a girl to play with.

$review_text.: This was a pleasant little read about a socialite New York teen, Bella, transplanted to Oklahoma. Bella reminded me of the main character, Cher, from the movie Clueless. She is basically a good, sensitive, fashion-conscious person who is also a little ditsy (ex.she has an episode with a cow where she is terrified it is going to eat her). The story revolves around Bella and her relationship with her new family, consisting of a step-father and 2 step-brothers, and her social life at school. There is also a sub-plot thrown in concerning a mystery surrounding the deaths of couple of football players. This provides an element of danger I really did not expect, but it added a nice balance. The book was well written, with interesting, believable characters and a plot with good continuity. The book did not lag and it had a fresh and clean story-line that I like to see in young adult novels. I highly recommend this to any book-loving teen, diva.

$REVIEW.: The book is told from both point of views of Mace and Scarlett which I liked a lot out of those two I couldn't decide which mind I liked being in which is a total first for me, Scarlett she likes to test her theories, "I leaned forward a little letting the girls pop out a bit, his eyes instantly honed in confirming my suspicions." There's only so much Mace can handle and I'm proud of the boy for giving fair warnings, "babe, if you don't quit it, you're going to find yourself bent over this counter with that sexy-a** skirt around your waist, and I won't give a s*** who effing walks in." He's also needy in some ways, "effing beautiful, so god damn wet, baby. Need to taste you." Actually he was more like an animal but still it was hot. He's kind of like an 'alpha' man very bossy, "lunch at Ma's on Sunday? I'll be firing up the grill; pick you up at eleven, yeah?" he told me in a rough voice. "Later, babe. Got s*** to do." He's possessive, "let's get a few things straight. I'm not a toy. You being pi**y at me only turns me on, and this 'thing' had no goddamn rules, except you are mine, Scar." Scarlett though can just be as bossy as Mace these two were made for each other, "Mace if you don't get in the back of that ambulance right now, I'm gonna have to punch you in the junk. And I really don't wanna do that, baby; I'm kinda in love with your junk." I loved reading this book and am really looking forward to Trip and Teeny's story.

$review_text.: The annual Deep Haven fishing contest draws professional and amateur anglers from across the country, but this year, Ross Springer is determined to win the top cash prize. In fact, he has no choice. It's his last chance to leave a lasting legacy at Bethel College. He just never imagined his fundraising scheme would hook Abigail Cushman, the grad student who reminds him of all they'd had--and lost--every time she glances his way.Abigail Cushman may not know the difference between a bass and a trout, but how hard can it be to catch a fish? She's a quick learner, and she's certain her smarts can net her a win over Ross Springer, the handsome charmer she's tried to forget since grief tore them apart.In the ultimate showdown between brains and heart, will Ross and Abby reel in more than they bargained for?HOOK, LINE, AND SINKER is an e-short a couple of years old, but it took me some time to get to a kindle book to read it.  I enjoyed getting to know Abby and Ross and the conflicts both faced in this story. It isn't all about fishing, but they both have hopes, dreams, successes and failures to deal with that may or may not coincide with each other.HOOK, LINE, AND SINKER is a really cute story set in Ms. Warren's fictional town of Deep Haven. I recommend it to fans of Ms. Warren.

$REVIEW.: Twitter Diaries revolves around the friendship between Stella and Tuesday, who get introduced to each other at a New Year's Eve Party. Over the course of the next year, they bond over twitter sharing their thoughts and stories about pretty much everything.For the most part, I guess this was a decent read but just not as good as I wanted it to be. I knew going in that this was more of a feel-good novel and didn't expect anything big/deep from it but this isn't the first book I've read that (supposedly) takes place on twitter and I loved Goodnight Tweetheart so I honestly thought I'd enjoy this one as well.The first thing that bugged me was that for a book that's called The Twitter Diaries, not a whole lot of tweeting takes place .The beauty/ugly thing about twitter that the tweets are mostly public but most of this novel takes place through DMs. So yeah, although the author stuck to the character limit, I didn't really get much of a twitter feel.Don't get me wrong, like most fluffy books this one's a quick and light read, perfect to kill a few hours but that's all it is. The writing's simple, relatable and suits this decade, where social media rules the world.

$review_text.: Disclaimer: I received this book from the author in exchange for a review. This does not affect my review and the following is my honest opinion.I'm not going to beat around the bush with this review: The Secret Dead is flat out amazing! Phenomenal even. S.W. Fairbrother has crafted a rich, interesting world over the modern city of London with such skill and talent that it sucks you right in! From the first page I was immersed in a London where street weasels and shifters were everyday and common. Where the police have the supernatural on staff and, while it might rub a few people the wrong way, they're valued members of the force. The way the paranormal is so artfully woven with the mundane in the London of The Secret Dead is incredible. S.W. Fairbrother writes so beautifully and so well that it's hard to believe this is the first in the Vivia Brisk series. Honestly, the storytelling in this book is beyond great!I was riveted to the page, on the edge and worried for the characters who so easily slipped their way into my heart. Each time I learned another of their secrets I was even more invested and, quite happily so, left wanting to know more. S.W. Fairbrother not only built an immersive, exciting world but populated it with engaging, interesting characters. There's something so believable, so human, about them all (even the ones that aren't quite human) that they really came to life in my mind. I have so many questions and was given just the right amount of answers to leave me hungry for the next book. Which, to me, is the show of a truly remarkable author. If I'm sitting there stunned after finishing a book and my heart twisting in remorse for having finished, I know I've read something great. And I love this book. Seriously I cannot stop talking about it to everyone I meet. I've found one of my new favorite authors and I cannot wait for more! I fear I might be infected after reading this book! I may as well be a zombie from the pages of The Secret Dead with the way I'm going to mindlessly shamble about, waiting for the next installment!If you like exciting paranormal mysteries with a strong, intriguing heroine, this book is for you. If you like paranormal detective work and a world filled with shapeshifters and undead and trolls and so many other fantastical beings, this book is for you. If you like worlds just this side of safe from a zombie apocalypse, this book is for you.If you have a pulse, this book is for you. It's so amazing I'd be shocked if someone didn't like it.(This review also appears on maudekip.com.)

Amhad was the cold-blooded killer how could she even prop her mouth to say he got what he deserved. I don't understand how can you feel sorry for a stick up kid. they are too lazy to work what they want they rather take from someone else Ahmad got what he deserved A&J you need to come up with a part 2 to this story a sequel and state it off with Kasheef's verdict overturned for lack of evidence and Kasheef's released from prison and the story picks up from where it left off

$REVIEW.: Unlike so many U-boat commanders, this guy was a Nazi.  To a great extent, he was not likable -- of course.  But, it in the end, I think he started realizing the errors of his past beliefs.  Above all, he was an excellent U-boat commander who thought first of his crew.  I could not help respecting the man; my hubby had to keep reminding me, &#34;he was a NAZI!&#34; -- especially at the end when I bawled my eyes out.

A lot of the titles are similar even some of the covers look the same so I'm not spending as much money on books as when I first purchased my kindle. I picked up Hood Wolves because I liked the cover and the author's name was kind of catchy. I'm proud to say that this book was good as heck. Everything is not always what it seems and there are more secrets and wolves in sheeps clothing than a little bit. The author did a great job with making this book interesting and she kept the reader guessing.

$review_text.: Seventeen-year-old, high-school senior, Tara Luna, was orphaned when she was a year-old baby and has been raised by her Uncle Pat, an unconventional, "hippie" type who loves to move around. Tara is even more unusual than her uncle. Her two closest friends in her wandering life are ghosts. Millicent can move people and things and can physically materialize, but mostly she takes a form that looks like smoke. Henry doesn't materialize, and he doesn't talk much, but when he is peeved, he lets it be known by hiding things. In addition to seeing and speaking to ghosts, Tara can read the minds of living people. Between the traveling, the ghosts and the mind-reading, Tara has never tried to make friends with living people because it seems pointless. Even if anyone could relate to her, she's always moving on. But suddenly, in this new school, the whole pattern of her life changes. An angry, dangerous, teen-girl ghost demands that Tara solve her murder--and she's hard to ignore because she inhabits Tara's home. A beautiful cheerleader who has persecuted Tara is in danger, and only Tara can save her. And a gorgeous, bad boy named Flynn proves more irresistible than any guy Tara has ever known.At 156 pages, this is a fast, entertaining read suitable for YA readers ages 12-15, though older teens and adults will enjoy it too.I was a big fan of the TV series,Medium, and Tara is kind of a teenage Allison Dubois. Like Allison, Tara has the powers of precognition through instant intuitions of people and situations, touching something a person owns and going into her perceptions, dreaming about someone and getting information, and obtaining vital information from ghosts. Also like Allison, these gifts run in her lineage. But Tara has an additional power that Allison does not--she can read minds.I really liked Flynn, and Tara's budding romance with him is one of my favorite parts of this book.Anyone who enjoyed theDead Isbooks by Marlene Perez won't want to miss this fun new paranormal mystery series.I rate this book as follows:Heroine: 5 starsSubcharacters: 5 starsFantasy World-Building: 5 starsWriting: 5 starsMystery Plot: 5 starsRomantic Subplot: 5 starsOverall: 5 stars

Whether you are already a professional public speaker, or just starting, or if you only need it for school, this book definitely will help you. It will definitely help those who are struggling to speak in public.After reading this book, it also made me realize why some speeches are not listened to. Not only because of the lack of interest of the audience, but mainly because the speaker themselves may not believe what they are talking about. How are you going to sell what you don't believe in?This book strongly emphasizes about selling your speech, as it is the most effective way to make the audience you're speaking to listen and buy what you're promoting.If you wanna be an effective speaker, go grab this book!

$REVIEW.: This book was excellent. So refreshing from the usual paranormal everyday formula some authors rush to put out. Bad boys with bad ass powers who are incredibly sexy and all alpha male can only be described as awesome. The females in this book are also not the damsel in distress wait until someone saves me type either. It is so rare to find people of color  in these types of books withoutall the typical stereotypes attached. I loved aethan, echo and all the characters in this book I hope kira will get her a story really soon

$REVIEW.: A great introduction discussing many of nature's patterns is followed by some totally amazing and clear pictures from a wide variety of subjects, some of which are: animals, arcs (aurora and rainbow), butterflies, cacti, cliffs and canyons, fruit, flowers, fossils, reflections, shells etc.This book is just not for children although it is written at their level but I think everyone will get a &#34;wow&#34; moment at least once (I got way more) as they read this book. We live in an amazing world and as the author says, there is way more to see than in this book but this is a great start!Happy reading!

$REVIEW.: Our family was interested in getting a new puppy.  Pet dander was a big factor.  The Vizsla breed is extremely close to hypoallergenic, so that was a huge deciding factor.  In addition, with a daily soft brushing, the Vizsla is almost non shedding.  That means a cleaner home and minimal, or no fur in the vacuum sweeper.  The temperament of the Vizsla is extremely gentle and pleasing.  In addition, they are highly trainable.  All these factors were considered in our choice.  Both, our married children and us, are awaiting our new arrivals.  Ron

$REVIEW.: I just couldn't get connected with the characters in this book. I had just come off reading some really great books where I would think about the characters after I was done reading. This one made me want to rush through so I could search for a better BDSM book. The lead male was obsessed with &#34;BJs&#34; more than the lead female. It wasn't the expected &#34;alpha male&#34;, protective/cherish the lead female persona that I've come to love about the BDSM genre. I didn't want to know any more about him. The story was very one-sided and I didn't understand why the lead female stayed with him let alone agreed to marry him.

$review_text.: Historical Romance in the Puritan era? I've gotta try that! Her Wicked Sin definitely didn't disappoint! Lydia Colson is a relative new comer in Salem Village


She arrived about a year prior and has taken over the job as the village physician and midwife after leaving her own home town in the wake of...murder! Lydia killed her husband and needs a fresh start where no one knows of her past, and the neighbors just think her husband is a merchant off at sea
Then one night she stumbles upon a man who has fallen off his horse in the woods

Henry can't make it to town in his condition, so Lydia brings him to her own home in order to tend his wounds
And then a neighbor lady bursts in due to an emergency and screams &#34;adulterer!&#34; Luckily, Henry is a quick thinker and claims to be her husband back from his travels

Unfortunately for Lydia, pettiness among her village soon also screams out &#34;witch!&#34; A death sentence in those times.I love this time in history, but haven't read many books set in it


I was a bit worried since Her Wicked Sin is a romance, and Salem in 1692 doesn't exactly sound romantic, but I wanted to give it a try

I'm certainly glad I did, because Lydia and Henry don't hold anything back! They don't immediately jump into bed


They actually talk some, but the attraction is obvious


I absolutely adored all of the historical boner banter! There's some good lines in there! The sex scenes are also pretty good
Nothing too wild or exciting there, but it fits the period.While the romance was good, I enjoyed the plot even more
Lydia is trying to blend into Puritan society, but everything about her brings questions
None of the neighbors know her history, and would probably stone her on the spot if they found out she killed her husband


Then of course, there's her &#34;husband&#34; mysteriously being able to find her despite her moving away


Plus, a petty housewife is spreading rumors of witchcraft since her own husband can't keep his eyes of Lydia! And on top of that, a strange man has been looking for her! Her Wicked Sin does take on a slightly suspenseful tone toward the end with Lydia's trial and stalker


It's all resolved fairly quickly given the page length, but there was still a great twist at the end!I really liked Her Wicked Sin
It's refreshing to read a Historical Romance that isn't Regency (although I do love those)
There's also a great plot and admirable characters
Lydia isn't the typical woman of the time


She takes care of herself and offers her help to others

Henry is a good man who steps up to his responsibilities without compromising his values


The romance is sweet and steamy, and the plot is engaging

What more do you need?*Disclaimer: I received this book from the publisher through NetGalley for review


No compensation was offered or accepted.

Well not quite the end because I think there is one more book to come out still. I like it a lot but am annoyed that I have to wait for the next book, and I feel that it didn't need to be so long.

$REVIEW.: Lyla Ward has written a would-be "how to" book and gotten it published by AmazonEncore.Not bad for a woman of ___ years.Did that blank disturb you? Well, it disturbed me too. In fact, the whole idea of a book written by an elderly woman who is doling out witticisms and salty advice, yet repeatedly refuses to give up her age (seriously, after 75, why be shy about it? ) makes the book seem a little foolish. Add to that the fact that there's not much really very useful included and you have a slightly humorous read that brings a weak smile to your face, but never elicits anything stronger.Now, I know a lot of people might feel I'm picking on an old woman and I certainly feel a bit like a bully knocking her work. But Lyla can take it. She's made it this far, I'm sure she's gotten a few bruises along the way. Rather than punch her book harshly, however, I'm going to smack her writing skills around a bit with some velvet gloves.Any book with "how to" in the title should actually be a How To Book. This is patently NOT one, unless for some odd reason you consider extremely short chapters of personal information, Lyla's views on tech, child rearing and other subjects not at all related to aging somehow pertinent and/or useful.  I didn't.Mrs. Ward is from another era, and it over-shows in many ways. I counted no less than 5 chapters about her frustrations about living in the computer age. Her syntax, voice and use of words that pretty much stopped appearing around the introduction of the microwave oven are troubling and made me feel uncomfortable. Where's the editor? What audience will relate to this book? Who is she writing for?  I didn't get it and I have a feeling most other readers won't either. If anything, the only audience that will be drawn to this type of product will be female, over 60 and possibly Jewish. I'm not sure what kind of number is attached to that demographic, but let's hope for Lyla's sake it's legion.The book feels like quickie articles previously published in periodicals strung together to make up something at least half an inch thick. Most chapters are only 2 to 3 pages long. The writing style is conversational. Picture yourself talking to your great-great aunt Millie in short, 10-minute bursts. Now picture yourself trying to figure out how to make a polite exit before you lapse into a coma while Millie drones on about vitamin supplements.I was hoping to get some sound advice on aging by someone who's been there.Instead I got bubkis.

$review_text.: Never Let You Go grabbed me from the very first page and never let me go. I was transfixed and my mind transformed by the impact that one bad decision can have on others. We humans see our lives in a vacuum. We think our decisions effect only ourselves, but in reality, they effect everyone around us.This book will help to clearly and precisely lay out the very reasons that God gave us rules to follow for a happy, successful life. If we follow God's rules, His commandments, for our life, it will be what God always meant for it to be. Filled with peace, His love, beauty, grace, and mercy.I was blown away by the presence of love and hope that refused to die or be driven away no matter how bad things became. I saw how God offers His amazing grace and beautiful love to us every minute of every day. He loves us and will not forsake us no matter what we do.This book brings about the stark realization that no matter what we do and no matter how far we roam from Good's plan for our lives, He is just a heartbeat away. he is waiting in the wings or at the next corner, or just behind you waiting for you to choose Love, to choose Him.This world is the playground of the Deceiver and the Destroyer of our soul. He is free to do what he wants when he wants, but no matter what happens God is always there for us to turn to for love, peace, and protection, and most importantly grace.One of the strongest tools we give the enemy is the power of our unforgiveness. When we invite this disease to have a home in our heart, we open a door that allows the enemy a foothold, a place of influence, over us. For the sake of our life and the lives of those we love, we need to deal with and forgive the people who caused us the pain that lead to our unforgiveness.In spite of the strength it seems that our enemy has the final decision is always up to us. This is why we need to have a strong, intimate, and ever-growing relationship with God, the lover of our soul. If we allow Him, He will guide us and show us the right decisions to make that will not only benefit us but also those we love.

$REVIEW.: It's basic story is about 4 damaged friends just trying to move on with their lives and find peace after what they went through.I really loved the emotions in this book. It carries over from the first book very well, showing the after effects such an event will have on people.This is mostly Jasper's story. (I consider it Derek and Kyra's as well.) Kyra is a new friend in their group of friends that make up their family.Jasper, Derek, and Kyra all start developing feelings for each other. Their feelings start from attraction and start to develop into more. They all try to avoid starting anything with each other because they know of the others feelings.Jasper is dealing with his feelings for two people he really cares about while dealing with a one night stand turned fiancee, Hannah, who is carrying his child and the stress she brings into his life.  Hannah and Jasper have a business marriage planned. No emotions, and all Jasper wants is to do the right thing for his child.Derek is busy trying to keep Kyra and River safe from some guy who has been attacking women. He tries to find out who it is and if he is a common link between the attacks on the women.Kyra had been attacked and is just trying to live life and figure out her developing emotions for Derek and Jasper.The only issue I had with this book was that sometimes a scene would seem to start in one place and somehow end up in another location without anyone going anywhere. There were just a few bits of information that seemed to be missing in that area. Such as the time they end up at the hospital and Derek picks up Mikey and Tells Sammy and River about Mikey.Other then that is is a beautiful story about people who are suffering from traumatic events from their past and learning to deal with it while trying to find their happily ever after.

$review_text.: If there is one thing that the reader will gather from reading this eloquent and engaging study, it is that there are no easy ways to fix problems. Systems are complex things, and pushing one button here may produce the intended outcome, but it might very well produce a side effect that is worse than the original condition.This idea is best described by the author, as she says, "it is almost irresistible to blame something or someone else, to shift responsibility away from ourselves, and to look for the control knob, the product, the pill, the technical fix that will make a problem go away." But doing one thing will require a shift in resources or an overflow of stock that might end up hurting more than it helps.Thinking in Systems uses this central idea to show the difficulties in solving our political and economic problems. With such a lucid, objective framework, it is only logical that the author takes an objective view of the subject matter. For the most part, she does not blame everything on one party or the other and seems rather even-handed in her criticism of both major parties.The book is most convincing in the realm of ecology, especially with regard to growth, which she rightly points out is a faulty goal in itself, and should be reconsidered from a systems perspective (i.e., with all the consequences in view).The libertarian might object to her conclusion that at least some major government intervention is necessary in order to prevent inefficiency and widespread hardship. As she puts it, "Some systems really need an intervenor!" When she implies that Ronald Reagan's anti-government stance was a reaction to corporate power, her biases are revealed. Hers is a line of thought that says that anyone who goes against government must be in collusion with corporations, and that anyone in collusion with corporations must be against the environment, personal freedom, etc.But the author even said that there are traps involved with government intervention. It is to forget that the government is the biggest corporation out there, and that system changes made by it can have more devastating side effects than anything done in the private sector.Ultimately, these biases don't injure the excellent treatment the author offers on the subject matter as a whole. And, as a result, this book comes highly recommended for anyone interested in systems, economics, or politics.

$REVIEW.: T.G. Ayer's Fire is a great first book in a series. The world building, and detail to attention is phenomenal. The attention, and creativity to the world that has been created in this novel is testament to this authors talent. I felt like I was right there, as if a movie was playing in my mind.The mythology and different roles of the characters were carefully thought out. It was very detailed orientated, and you can tell the author took her time, did her research, and had a love for what she was doing.I loved Maya's character. She was very strong, and took everything thrown at her in stride. She was very easy to empathize with, and her emotions were completely believable. Maya is very strong, and she really grew as a character throughout this story.Fire is plot driven, action packed, and full of unexpected twist. Even though this is a fantasy novel, T.G. Ayer writes it in a way that makes it completely believable.I couldn't put this book down. The excellent plot,  mythology, Lore, and fantastic character development kept me reading long into the night. Ms. Ayer's weaves together a story that will have you enthralled with every word until the last page.I am very much looking forward to the next book in this series, and can't wait to revisit the world that T.G. Ayer has created.I was given a copy of Fire in exchange for a honest review. My opinions are my own.

$REVIEW.: Hey I love the complete idiot and and Beginners guides

I use them as much as any regular guy
With that said, this is one that I would definitely say is not worth getting

1st off


While I may be your average idiot, I am smart enough to say that when your having someone write any kind of book on a subject find an expert on that subject

So a book on psychology should be written by lets say,.


hmm a Psychologist?!? But the author is not; nor has the experience to put Jung's theories into context
The author is a new age writer
At least for the Melonie Klein book they got a Melonie Klein expert, why couldn't they have got a Jung expert for this
I mean come on there are so many! I am a psychology student with a degree and have read a lot of Jungs material and feel that this book perpetuates only sad stereotypes of Jung and Freud that are, frankly some of them unsubstantiated.For example: Most Americans dont know that since the beginning Freud and JUngs books were written in German

It is widely known by most psychoanalytic scholars (such as Christine Downing) that most translations of thier writings are very badly done

In this case, thiers a lot of downright non-factual stuff in this book that is really greatly exaggerated

This is unfortunately the worst Introducing book i have rad thus far
Go with another version if you can or just read "Man and his symbols" by Carl Jung ; its not that hard to read sheesh.

Turns out that they both have had a secret crush on each other for awhile, but could never act on their feelings (of lust) because of Trina's overprotective older brother Nash (and Hutch's best friend). They have no such inhibitions this time, as Nash is not around. This story moves very quickly. In my opinion, it is just okay. If you have a few minutes to spare, read the book as a nice escape from reality.

$REVIEW.: SUMMER'S BOOK BLOGThrown by Love is book two in the Hear of the Game Series by Pamela Aares.Chloe is an enigma all of her own. She could talk you up and down with the stars and can dance circles around you with baseball. She should after all, being the only daughter to the owner of a professional baseball team. She struggles to fit in well with her academic persona and is finding herself aiming up short. That all is about to change once she is willed ownership of the team after the passing of her father.Scotty is in a slump. And the latest trade just proves it. He always thought he'd play with the Giants. But the baseball gods declares otherwise. While he's coming to terms with the fact that he now represents a new brand, the educated baseball player and playboy might just have met his match in Chloe.Ms. Aares wrote this book almost too well. She had me captivated within the first sentence of the book. I liked how the characters, while trying to do what's best for the other, still leave you with a sense of oh! They will persevere. This book was a mixture of sadness, love, comedy and yes even education. I felt like Ms. Aares once again put a lot of research into this book so that we are readers would be able to follow along and don't guffaw at statistical errors. The author had be teetering between wanting to love baseball more than i already do or pick up a Cosmology book just to see what swoon worthy man will ask if I read the newest version. The secondary characters really aided in getting to know Scotty and Chloe. I especially adored G'maw.This book had the best written instances of mis-communication and consequences I've ever read. They were so life like and had me thinking, oh! Come on guys it's all a misunderstanding!! So, does Scotty pitch the best game of his life or are the stars just not aligned for him and Chloe? You have to read this one to find out and you won't be disappointed!

$review_text.: `All That Glitters' is the second book in the Avalon series and the main focus is now on Kara. Kara's used to having her way as she is the Mayor's daughter. As the daughter of the mayor, especially in a small town, she usually gets what she wants when she wants it. What she wants now is the one thing she doesn't have which Emily and Adriane do - a magical gem. As the old adage says `all that glitters isn't gold' and this becomes quite evident when Kara has unknowingly brought herself to the attention of the evil monsters because of her discovery of a diamond unicorn horn.I know Kara has been my least favorite character in the Avalon series so far and some people may be off put by Kara being the focus of `All That Glitters'. Yet, I feel she does have some redeemable characteristics and deserves the chance to grow and learn from her mistakes and triumphs. I enjoyed `All That Glitters', even if I didn't like it as much as `Circles in the Stream'. I like how the author has created a series which is a great magical adventure, but also teaches the readers some valuable character lessons. I do wonder if the focus is going to shift now for every book in the series, which isn't necessarily a bad idea.Avalon: Web of Magic series: Circles in the Stream (1), All That Glitters (2), Cry of the Wolf (3), The Secret of the Unicorn (4), Spellsinger (5), Trial By Fire (6), Song of the Unicorns (7), All's Fairy in Love and War (8), Ghost Wolf (9), The Heart of Avalon (10), Dark Mage (11), Full Circle (12)

$REVIEW.: The Paleo way of eating may not be for everyone. It is based on the idea of eating the way our ancestors existed during the Paleolithic era so it's not so much of a diet but more a change of lifestyle. It suggests to eat pastured meats, sustainable seafood, fresh vegetables, wild fruit and foraged nuts rather than the commercially processed foods many of us consume now. The premise is good and the book is well written, giving solid arguments and references. However, giving up grains, legumes and dairy may be difficult for many. The recipes are very good, meal plans well thought out and daily tips are very insightful. Some of the information is repetitive but overall, worth the read and worth having in your arsenal of cookbooks.

$REVIEW.: Television is full of reality TV shows.  When I saw this book was available I immediately thought of the show Mafia Wives.  I am scared of those women! I think they could hurt me.  I say that with a smile but the reality is those women are hurting.  The life they are a part of is filled with violence and anger and they need the Lord Jesus just like we all do!This book was super confusing to me.  It seemed to me that the author spent alot of time trying to convince the reader (and herself?) that her life choices were acceptable and that she was innocent of the lifestyle she married into.  The book is about how she, a 'Christian', married a high profile mobster ( with no knowledge of the life he was leading?}.  The book talks about the years he was running from the law and then in prison and how he eventually gave his life to God and stepped away from the mob life.

$review_text.: I just finished &#34;Healing Love&#34; by Laura Hilton. This is the first book I have read by Laura Hilton but definitely will not be the last. This book is most assuredly 5 stars. I was drawn into the story from the first sentence. Kristi is injured in an accident and Shane saves her life. I couldn't wait to see how life would turned out for Kristi Lapp, An Amish midwife, and Shane Zimmerman, an English vet,who fell in love despite the two different lifestyles. This book will have you cheering for Shane and Kristi and then have you booing for Shane and then you will have the same feelings for the Amish elders in this story. This story proves true love wins in the end. I am hoping there are more stories with Shane and Kristi. I&#34;m hopping there will Books About Shane And Kristi.And will be reading more of her books.Thanks Laura for sending this book to My Email.I Love It.Your a very Blessed Writer

$REVIEW.: What happens at a culturally diverse school when the spectre of international terrorism rears its ugly head?  This book provides two parallel looks at the response of the students to the arrest of one of their classmates as allegedly being part of a terrorist plot.  The story opens with the arrest, and we watch the development of cultural tensions at the school from alternating points of view.  Jay is a junior, a member of the football team and white.  Haroon is Muslim and of Afghan descent.  These two narratives help us get inside the minds of students as they react to the fear.  The peer pressures of this age are portrayed well, and we find some truly admirable reactions as well as some very despicable ones.  However, most students fall somewhere in the middle as they try to understand their roles in the world.  This is a thoughtful and sensitive exploration of the issues of racism and cultural tolerance in the context of the fear associated with the threat of terrorism.
$SUMMARY.: Looking at the cultural divide from both sides

$review_text.: Considering the extremely limited scope of this book (Army Group North during the first six months of the war against the Soviet Union), this book offers only a cursory overview of its subject, and lacks significant detail. I can't help but think that Osprey squandered a great opportunity here by failing to offer any new information that can't already be found in other sources. Compounding the problem is that the maps are disappointing and too few in number. The book gives an adequate overview of Army Group North's campaign through the end of 1941, but that feat was achieved by others long before this book was published. Fortunately it's a relatively inexpensive book though, so it may be worth adding to your library if you don't already have a book on this subject. Just don't expect much more than a broad overview of the campaign.

$REVIEW.: His Acquisition is an amazing piece of work!  I took a chance with the Billionaire Domination thing, it seems to be the only thing out there right now and frankly done to death, but the cover got me.  I was once in the world of fashion and I love a good illustration of a dress.  And let me tell you, this was one excellent read.From the start the heroine is not my usual taste in lead females and that was a good thing.  Sadie turned out to be a spit fire and realistic woman who had come from harder times to land where she was now and while she's cleaned up her act there is still a vulnerable grittiness about her that really brings out a three dimensional character.And Mr. Malcolm Ward, oh what a refreshing change from our usual spoiled rotten rich guy who wants to play with a women like a possession because they own everything else.  He is a truly unique individual who slowly lets us see his more and more bizarre side as the story goes on.  Really a character that I can sink my teeth into.  Completely an original while still being sinfully sexy and of course gorgeous.  Thank the lord someone has come up with an original pair that can play out the millionaire Dom thing in a whole new light.Speaking of lights, that scene in the studio was absolutely stunning!  I have not had the pleasure of enjoying something so fresh and original in a very long time and take my word for it, I have read more than my share of amazing scenes.  The voice and description, the completely unique element of the pictures being taken during the play...Oh yes please!I highly recommend this read to anyone who is getting over the Grey hype and wants a fresh twist on the tried and true rich guy act.  Ava's written works are amazing and she's a machine when it comes to pumping out new original and great material!  This author will not disappoint.

If you grew up in a small town like I did, you'll appreciate how people make allowances for certain locals who are characters, but harmless.  It's part of the charm of a small community.I enjoyed this book and got quite a few laughs out of it.  If you want a book that's good clean fun, you'll enjoy this one.

$review_text.: Hunter by Chris Allen is the second in the Intrepid series, Defender is book one. It is a four hundred and forty page novel, written in third person. I have not read Defender yet, but did not feel like I missed anything, each is a standalone story. I love when the author of a spy series is ex-military/law enforcement himself, so much inside information to draw from. Read Allen's bio, it is very impressive.Hunter will have you hooked within the first few pages. It is action-packed, fast-paced and the descriptions are easy to imagine. Alex Morgan's character is a member of Interpol's secret Intrepid branch, part military, part law enforcement. His role is well defined, having all the best gadgets at his disposal, and someone you would want as a friend or love interest. Alex Morgan is on a mission that spans the globe to rescue the goddaughter of his boss who has been kidnapped by Serbian war criminals. I highly recommend the book.

$review_text.: One hallmark of a gifted novelist is the ability to see the potential for compelling fiction in an incident, anecdote or scrap of history, no matter how dry or seemingly obscure, that others have overlooked

By that standard and several others, the career of Juan Gabriel V&aacute;squez, a Colombian writer born in 1973, is off to a notable start with "The Informers," his ambitious first english translated novel from his native spanish.His topic is one of the least-known episodes of World War II

Fearful of Nazi influence in Latin America, the United States, acting through J
Edgar Hoover's F.B.I

and the State Department, compiled a list of suspected Axis sympathizers and then pressured compliant governments to intern those named, often on the basis of sketchy or dubious intelligence.Anti-Fascist refugees from Germany and Italy, along with the descendants of immigrants from those countries and Japan, were snared in that net and frequently imprisoned together with real Nazis

There were other abuses: corrupt government officials and covetous neighbors would sometimes falsely accuse prosperous &eacute;migr&eacute;s, hoping to gain control of their expropriated businesses and homes."The system of blacklists gave power to the weak, and the weak are the majority," one character in "The Informer" muses bitterly


"That was life during those years: a dictatorship of weakness


The dictatorship of resentment," in which there were thousands "who accused, who denounced, who informed."The parallels with the contemporary war on terror are clear, though Mr

V&aacute;squez chooses not to make them explicit

In remarks last year to the PEN American Center, he recalled Balzac's maxim that "novels are the private histories of nations," and that is the approach he deftly applies here, telling his story through the experience of three families.At the start of "The Informers," a young Bogot&aacute; writer named Gabriel Santoro has just written a book about the Enemy Alien Control Program, as Washington called it, based on the recollections of Sara Guterman, an elderly German Jewish &eacute;migr&eacute; and family friend


To his shock and distress his father, a distinguished professor of law and oratory also named Gabriel, savages the book in a review, causing a rift between the two.The novel is constructed across four dates


The first is 1988, when journalist Gabriel Santoro stumbles on one of the hidden parts of Colombian history: the story of how Germans and Austrians were treated during the second world war


At first, those who opposed Hitler were regarded in the same way as Nazi sympathisers, but when President Santos took Colombia into the war on the side of the allies, Nazi sympathisers had their businesses confiscated and found themselves interned as possible spies and fifth columnists


The book Gabriel writes about this, A Life in Exile, is generally well received, except by his own father, who writes a damning criticism of it.Gabriel's father then distances himself from his son, only relenting when he faces a heart operation and asks to see him

The operation gives the old man a new lease of life, but he dies suddenly in a car crash a few months later

As a result of his death, Gabriel tries to discover more about his father's early life; he is horrified to find out from an old friend that his father was one of the second world war informers
Worse, he informed on a family of close friends, who were resolutely anti-Nazi, with terrible consequences.Gabriel wants to know more about the exact circumstances surrounding his father's death

He knows that he travelled to the city of Medell&iacute;n with the young woman who had become his lover, but not why he wanted to make the trip

When he does find out, it takes him back once again to the tragic days of the war, and the betrayals and failed loyalties that seem to characterise the life of almost every character in the book.What the narrator learns about his father spurs him to write another book, this time a fictional recreation of what might have happened not only during the war, but in his father's last moments


There is a further twist when the friend betrayed by his father reads the book, and tells him his father came to see him the day before he died

Gabriel sets out for Medell&iacute;n with the hope of uncovering what transpired between the two men, who had not seen each other for more than 40 years


As so often in real life, the result leaves more questions than it answers.V&aacute;squez shows a mastery of technique and language
The examination of the consequences that a single act can have not only for the person committing it but also, through the ripple effect, for many others brings us into the territory of another Spanish writer, Miguel de Unamuno and his novel "Mist"(Niebla)

The novel may not have the fireworks of magical realism, but its sure construction of narrative and vivid portrayal of a wide array of characters build an extraordinary tale, one which reminds the reader that any novel can be a fascinating mixture of magic and realism.

Oh, and if you like Magnus Ridolph, then you owe it to yourself to check out Matthew Hughes's wonderful books, Majestrum, The Spiral Labyrinth, Hespira, and 9 Tales of Hengis Hapthorn, all of which feature Hughes's own take on the "galactic private eye," if you will, in a gracious and eloquent style that is both reminiscent of Vance and, at the same time, original and unique. And while Vance is the grand master, sans doute, in this particular sub-genre, I do believe Hughes excels even Vance. So, by all means, read Magnus Ridolph, and then check out Hughes.

$review_text.: I love the stories and I love that they were packaged together. I really enjoyed the love stories in each of the books.  I do have to comment on the issues and inconsistency with Sands daughter Daisy.  The child was four years old and in a bouncy seat and teething? NOT.  The rest of it was good though and I especially liked the story with Parker and Cal.  My favorite was the story of Tony and Sophia the rekindling of their romance being a married couple.

$review_text.: A fast paced read with a climbing flavor.  This detective story is interesting because the theme is about people involved in the sport of climbing.  Also, the motive for the murder has a new twist.  The detective is a climber so he knows how to view the  evidence and the writer lets us in on some of the vocabulary used in climbing. It is a good story.

$REVIEW.: I was excited to start this book as it is the continuing story of a family in the States and the connection with a woman in war-torn France at the end of World War I.  A young man joins the army and is sent over to France leaving a bride and her in-law family to run the family ranch. The wife receives the news that her husband is killed in action. But he has been wounded and taken in by a French woman who nurses him back to health but due to his injuries he has total amnesia. After reading the first book I wanted more and I must say that after reading Home by Nightfall I hope this author goes on to write a third book in the series.

$REVIEW.: What a beautiful story this was.  Although I admit I got this book free from Amazon, I can tell you that I would have been willing to pay much more for it.  To me, most romance books are the same-old-same-old but with a slight twist.  Homecoming was an emotional story with substance.  I am a fast reader who reads a book a day but I have only read two books that I felt rated a review.  This is my second review while the first I wrote was for The Governor's Gardener.

$REVIEW.: Fans of Ian Fleming's novels will enjoy these comic-strip renditions, which make even disappointing titles like "Diamonds Are Forever" enjoyable. The period detail in McLusky's drawings is remarkable, though there are problems with point of view ("Live and Let Die" actually alternates between first- and third-person p.o.v.) until the writers sensibly settled upon third-person narration in "Dr. No," the sixth in the series. The only real disappointment is "Thunderball," the exposition of which is even more ambitious and laborious than that of "From Russia with Love." Evidently the "Daily Express" was forced to cut this last one short, and the narrative completely disintegrates after the 57th installment. Obviously violence and nudity were toned down for newspaper publication, but short stories like "Risico," "From a View to a Kill," and "For Your Eyes Only" actually benefit from serialization. Looking forward to volume 002.

$review_text.: I can tell Connelly is an excellent writer, and I know many people who love everything he does.  I've just never been able to connect with Bosch, and so I'm less invested in the outcome of some of these stories as they relate to him.  Still, the writing and plotting are tight and fast-paced, so I read along with a pretty good sense of enjoyment.  These are probably a good introduction to Connelly's Bosch series - although they didn't inspire me to go back and try to get through another full-length novel of his.

$review_text.: When I first sat down to read "Keeping Score" by Marc Brackett I didn't realize how much contemplation and consideration was going to be involved. It was quite deceiving. I expected to fly through this little book in a day or two, not the week it took. It was a great little journey and, with the help of personal quizzes, provides some great insights into relationships and marriage.This book actually works alongside Marc's website, [...], for assistance in downloading worksheets and evaluating your scores. When I first printed the worksheets and told my husband we were going to take a relationship quiz I received one of those, "I'm not taking another Cosmo quiz. Our marriage is fine." looks. When I told him it wasn't a magazine quiz but it was an in-depth quiz regarding our marriage he agreed. There are two very distinct quizzes; one for men and a separate one for women. Each quiz is divided into subcategories including Career, Finance, Intimacy, etc. and even though the topics were the same on each quiz the questions were different. The scores are then evaluated to prioritize the subcategories that are the most important to each partner and how the two of you can work together to strengthen your relationship.I've read other relationship and marriage-building books like "Ever After" and "The Five Love Languages" and there are parallel's to "Keeping Score." The general concepts are the same but "Keeping Score" is unique because it is so interactive. It was an enjoyable little book.
$SUMMARY.: Great Relationship Book

Heather's last boyfriend shows up to cause a few problems as well.The heat meter in this book goes up a few notches.

$REVIEW.: Seriously, I do. I want to move to the neighborhood that holds all this magic, wonder and pure talent. Angela Cartwright and Sarah Fishburn put together a magnificent book that will call me back to review the delicious pages for years. The realm of wildly creative artists who took part in this project is fantastic - from Nina Bagley to Lesley Riley, Erika Tyesse to Susie LaFond. Each of these incredible artists produced a vibrant, comfy House, with every detail perfectly captured in top-notch photography. You can't fully appreciate these Houses unless you study the pictures, examining each abode inch-by-inch, until you feel like you are sitting at the piano in Susie LaFond's "Lake House", smelling the luscious whirlwind of scents in the quaint kitchen of Sarah Fishburn's "French Studio", or giggling over the children's antics with Ms. Bea Keeper in Jen Osborn's "House for Naughty Children".There is absolutely no way to discover all the treasures these Houses contain in one pass of the book - no, this stunning neighborhood of amazing Houses must be visited multiple times in order to get the full experience. This neighborhood puts the Welcome Wagon to shame - every piece invites you in for an intimate peek into each artist's soul. And although each House is as unique as its creator, the neighborhood melds together because the Houses are so in sync.This is one of my very favorite books - the richness of your experience is further increased with the sidebars present for each House. The plethora of quotes sprinkled throughout the book enhance your journey and make you stop to dream about what your own House would look like. In This House is not only inspirational, but also a how-to book of sorts - with the house template and wonderful art included at the back of the book. The "Guide to the Tool Shed" (Glossary) adds much value to this book - it's a great reference and sure to make even the most novice altered art visitor feel at home. "The General Store" - where to purchase LOADS of cool supplies - is an invaluable resource for those unsure about where to find mouth-watering provisions.Go for a visit in this beautiful, one-of-a-kind neighborhood - where the homeowners go out of their way to make you feel comfortable. Just make sure you wear comfy shoes!

At first I didn't think he would be sweet but how he is so caring with Jennifer, how he treats his mother, grandmother, and even his manager Vera shows his sweet and kind side. I love how he tries to come up with plan to get rid of Dickwick who I can't stand and I just know he is sleazy and sneaky but everytime I think his deception is going to show it doesn't. I really don't like how easily Jennifer gives in to Bradley, he treats her like crap and she doesn't even see it or thinks she deserves it. I really like Jennifer and hope her and Blake get together soon, she is a strong woman but oh so sweet and deserves someone that cares about her and puts her needs first. I like how the books I love are worked into the storyline, I love her idea for the daytime slot on Blake's TV station and I think it is great how you worked it to show what is happening now on TV and at the movies with many of our favorite books. I can't wait to see what happens in the next book, really hoping  Dickwick gets what is coming to him.

$review_text.: By: M.J.KadishPublished By: M.J.K.Age Recommended: AdultReviewed By: Arlena DeanRating: 4Review:"A Patriotic Whore" by M.J. Kadish was a very interesting story of this author's 'great insight into sex.' Now, let me say up front this novel isn't for the faint hearted. It's about S E X(erotica). In this read we find a funny 'party girl' named Blaire Reese who loved 'booze, boys and sex. Being in college and not knowing what she wanted to do with her life meets a CIA agent and asked to 'join an elite squad of undercover agents.' Blaire decided that this was for her and she began her training in the 'art of Seduction and Sexual Manipulation' at the Project Cathouse where people were mere puppets where the CIA taught these agents 'how to use their sexuality to enslave the emotions of any person they desired, and then use that person for their own agendas.' All in all, this was definitely a physiological experience of others feelings, finding what makes them tick...even learning their 'weaknesses and using empathy, then learning to use it to your advantage...having that person at your mercy and then learning the difference between of seduction and manipulating the person.' All seems to be going well until Blair confronted Drummond about her feelings. Was she in love? At this point I will say you must pick up the read to see what next this author will bring to the reader. This author really did his magic with this novel because a lots of it read like a 'seduction and skill manual.' I like Blair's assessment of her life toward the end "I was in love with love, y'all. I liked being in love. I liked experiencing love. I like remembering what love felt like and wallowing in it...Love dun set me free." But was this the love she wanted? Again from the read you will find out what that is all about. The characters Blair, Rae, Drummond, Sabrina, Mr. Lucky, Maria to Mark only to name a few were all well developed and indeed colorful.OK, "A Patriotic Whore" was a unique read and this author really did some work just thinking of it all that went into this novel. I am still not sure If I like it or not however, this author has written a well scripted dialogue with much food for thought. Well some of it. Now, the ending I thought was somewhat strange but the author ended it in sort of a cliffhanger? Will there be a sequel? If you are looking for a different kind of read that is hilarious, with erotic/erotica sex scenes and with some twists then this read would be for you! To the author: Wow what a read!

$review_text.: When I obtained the book I thought it was about a woman (Simone) who is hired to catch cheating husbands but it turned out to be about revenge on a woman a husband cheated with. I read romance novels, some of which get a bit steamy, but I'm not much into reading erotica books (which I believe is the category this book falls into) so I got bored with the "dirty" language quickly.  So after chapter five, I was more interested in knowing who had hired Simone and why, so I jumped to the last few pages for the "big reveal".  I think this is a creative story concept for a series, for this book genre, and many readers. Because of my reading preferences, I probably won't read the other books in the series but would recommend the series to anyone who likes this genre.

Besides this, he is completely neglected by his mum and dad. He takes pleasure in spending time with his Grandfather who he adores. He has an intelligent friend call Tom who is also a welcome distraction from his problems. He is in love with his classmate Zoe, who right from the get go is completely unaware of this and indeed of him.A very unfortunate thing happens to the person he loves most and we are left worrying that this will destroy Andy but this actually makes him. His grandfather keeps a promise, which pushes Andy forward..This a great feel good story and very poignant for those of us who were not the popular kids at school.Supernatural Hero would work great on the big screen too.I loved this book and could not put it down.

Author Christina McKenna deftly crafted the story in such a way that brought me to really for the characters. I found myself crying on one page and then laughing out loud a few pages later. The writing is lyrical and clear, and the story is strong and beautiful without being fantastical, mushy, unbelievable, or silly. I'll definitely be looking for more from this author.
$SUMMARY.: Beautiful writing and great storyline

$REVIEW.: ... This by far is the best book of Dragonlance I have read yet! ... I hate giving out fives but this book is perfect! I love the story of Kitiara's and her two brothers beginnings. Also, her travels are very interesting and she meets some unique characters. It's so hard to believe that this is Tina Daniell's first book! Wow! A must read! Now! This book will fill you with anticipation with what will happen next. I wish all Dragonlance books could be this great! I had to finish it in one day! Fantistic character development and you see Kit develop over the years into a warrior, along with her brothers in their own right. I don't think I can find anything wrong with this book except that it ended. BRAVO TINA DANIELL!

$review_text.: The information in this book is SO IMPORTANT to the health of people of ALL ages!I just wish that more people would read this book, for the sake of their health and that of their families.  I'm spreading the word about this book and B12 deficiency on my Facebook page, through e-mail, and by posting on websites for Dr. Oz (if he would have it on his show, people would pay attention), Autism, Dementia, Alzheimer's, etc.. I've also bombarded my Dr. with information to educate her about true levels of B12 deficiency.I started my research on B12 because of my 84 year old father's recent short term memory loss, but I've found that lack of B12 may also cause Autism and other mental retardation in babies and children - an even more sad story that needs to get out to the public.I hope that the medical community will take time to read this book and educate themselves as to why they should do a SERUM B12 test on ALL sick patients.  There is no reason not to, as the test is cheap and the cure for deficient B12 is also cheap and easy.  B12 shots of Hydroxocobalmin 1000 mcg are way better absorbed by the body, so read this book and don't just take some B12 pills.

$review_text.: If I didn&#8217;t recently read and review (12/09/2012) Harriet Beecher Stowe&#8217;s 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' , I would be attracted to Carl Waters&#8217;s ( book one) version of this American classic. Uncle Tom's Cabin is the most important novel ever written for the American people with the possible exception of Thomas Paine&#8217;s 1776 pamphlet, 'Common Sense' . Mr. Water&#8217;s novel is the first of four planned novels dissecting the original novel into four parts. One would ask, why? Well, according to the author, &#8220;The Burning Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin series comprises four books whose narratives are told from the slaves points of view. I have removed many of the racial stereotypes, plot holes, and excessive preaching from Harriet Beecher Stowe&#8217;s world changing story.&#8221; Waters also states in the book&#8217;s introduction, &#8220;I do not understand or agree with Uncle Tom&#8217;s overall mindset.&#8221; This is where I disagree. In my mind, Uncle Tom is the most courageous and righteous character in American Literature. When Tom died in Stowe&#8217;s 1852 novel, it ignited a groundswell of opinion against the South and slavery. When Stowe met President Lincoln in 1862 at the White House, he called her, &#8220;The little woman who started this great war.&#8221; And I believe the character of Uncle Tom had a lot to do with purging America of slavery.Burning Uncle Tom&#8217;s Cabin deals with Stowe&#8217;s sidebar story of George Harris, his wife Eliza and their son, Harry. George lives on the plantation of the wicked Frank Harris. George is on loan to a hemp factory where he invented a hemp-cleaning machine to the delight of his foreman, Charles Wilson. Understandably, George, through his hard work, has earned the right to occasionally visit his wife and son at the Shelby Plantation five miles away. George is planning his escape to Canada. Meanwhile at the Shelby&#8217;s estate, Eliza and her son are treated as family (if that&#8217;s possible). But trouble is brewing. One day a slave trader appears at the plantation. Eliza overhears the trader, Dan Haley, calling in a debt from Mr. Shelby. He wants Uncle Tom and Eliza&#8217;s Harry to settle the debt. Eliza warns Uncle Tom and then runs for Canada with three year old Harry.Back at the hemp factory, Mr. Harris suddenly appears and wants George back on the farm, so to speak. Why? On page thirteen, Mr. Wilson protests losing George and the contemptible  Frank Harris says, &#8220;I won&#8217;t have him stayin&#8217; another minute, pickin&#8217; up airs and thinkin&#8217; too high of himself! This boy&#8217;s a lazy, no good Negro, ain&#8217;t never done anything worthwhile at my plantation!&#8221; Once back on the plantation, Frank Harris treats George badly, giving him the worst chores possible. George is told that he will never see his Eliza and Harry again; in fact, he is forced to take a wife that Frank Harris picks out. When George objects, he is severely whipped and branded on the palm of his hand. Later that night, one of Uncle Tom&#8217;s sons sneaks over to George&#8217;s shack and informs him that Eliza and Harry are on the run to Canada. Now George is also on the run! All of this happens during the first 77 pages. The rest of this unique rewrite revolves around the pursuit of the Harris family by the slave traders. Will they make it to Canada, or will tragedy strike? You will have to buy your own copy of this revised version of Harriet Beecher Stowe&#8217;s classic to find out.I believe it would be more advantageous for Mr. Waters to write his own Southern Gothic novel rather than pursue this project. The task he is taking-on is very difficult. I see talent in his writing, but certain attributes he is trying to change are very difficult and awkward to modify. For example: the language used in his variant of the novel. In the 1850s, writers like Stowe and Mark Twain used the African American Vernacular English dialect spoken by the negroes of the time period. The author could have used a cleansed version of this dialect. I&#8217;m talking about using the local colloquial expressions of the whites (which the author did occasionally)  and the negroes (which the author didn&#8217;t do) to make the novel more believable. This is very hard to do and still accomplish what Mr. Waters set out to achieve, namely a novel where the slaves are not inferior to the whites; have equal intelligence, and have the courage to shed their shackles. In a certain way, the author did that, but lost credence by not using a purified version of the local vocabulary of 1851. Anyway, I commend the author for taking on this very difficult endeavor, but it wasn&#8217;t original enough for me.

$review_text.: (Spoilerless review) This graphic novel starts out with little explanation as to who the characters are, how they got there, or what they're doing.  But the story telling is so involving that you'll ultimately not care, with both writing and art that is fast paced and engrossing enough that by the time you realize the beginning was not a dream sequence you're already off and running into the next surprise. When you reach the ending you'll realize nothing was explained along the way, but will be strangely OK with it.The story centers around what appear to be a bunch of small fairy-tale type folk who live in the woods. Or are they dolls come to life? And where did they come from, and how long have they been there?  They almost feel as if they have just recently arrived, and at times you wonder if the small female lead is some manifestation of the real world body of a dead girl that is near their homes. As the only ethical person in the lot, she takes up the mantle of provider, trying to help others in this "lost boys" tribe of immature and bratty wee-folk, just as the decomposing dead body helps the nearby animals of the forest floor.Fans of Vertigo's "Fables" will like this, particularly those who think that long running series is now growing a little stale and could use a shot of creativity like what is on display here.  The painted color artwork is often cartoony but still proficient, and works well with the little houses and their interiors for animals (think David Peterson's "Mouseguard" series, "Stuart Little" , "A Cricket in Times Square", "The Rescuers", etc.).  It also provides a nice foil to this fairy tale like story that starts out sweet but quickly turns the darkest shade of black. A strangely satisfying book considering it seems like it is both missing a beginning and leaves you wanting more at the end.Originally published in France, this english hard bound version comes in at 94 pages.  No information on the writers or artist is included, making who put this book together and what else they have worked on almost as much of a mystery as the story they wrote.  If you're looking for something fresh and new this is a great way to go.

$review_text.: I'm really on the fence about this book

 The book starts off as a story about Beryl and her adventures as a house sitter and then becomes a sort of romance novel

 I thought it worked better at the beginning and I liked Beryl and enjoyed her story

 However, I didn't like her as much when she started house sitting for Gavin, the rock star.Eventually they go on to form the romance portion of the book

 But while they're getting to know one another via email and messaging, Beryl sort of stalks him
 I get that she's going to Google him...of course she is
 But she hacks his computer, goes thru his office and has one of Gavin's girlfriends removed from the approved visitor list at his apartment building

 All this before they've ever met in person
 I thought her actions were inappropriate and not the basis for some great love between Beryl and Gavin
 To top it all off, Beryl helps herself to a wardrobe that Gavin had specifically asked her to get rid of....she even wore one of the outfits on a date to meet him.Another thing that bothered me was that Gavin, who is a total man-whore before Beryl, falls deeply in love with her over the internet in a very short amount of time.The writing I found very good, the story....not so much

 But I bet that as this author gains experience her stories will become stronger


 I'll keep an eye open for more books from her.

$REVIEW.: Two opposite and clashing people must join forces to investigate the Jack the Ripper case and reveal their passionate desires along the way!Lady Anna Jacobs is a woman ahead of her era and walking her own path in life

She is studying to become a doctor, wants to help women with her medical knowledge, dodging her mom's matchmaking and sometimes helps her Scotland Yard brother, Simon, with his cases


During her hated Seasons, she gave men a chance to get to know her and the only thing she did was repeal them with her inner strength and intelligence


Men are such idiots! Anna has never had any man that has understood her mind or even accepted her as is, so gave up on marriage and now gives 100% to medicine.Andrew Foster was raised as the 3rd son of a duke, had one great older brother and a mother that never loved him

During an agreement between his parents, he learns he is actually the illegitimate son of his father's and &#34;The Duchess&#34; was forced to have him in her home

Andrew was so miserable that he crawled into a bottle, bedding random woman and misbehaved to ease his pain

The problem is he never crawled back out, until he was arrested and jailed, as Jack the Ripper
Simon Jacobs from Scotland Yard knew he was innocent and asks him to help him investigate and find the real killer

Now that Andrew has been cleared of all charges, he has a new purpose for his life and hopefully a new addiction!Andrew and Anna meet and clash in Simon's study, as she stitches him up, crookedly, after he is attacked


After her brother is sent to Scotland, Anna and Andrew share his study, as she studies medicine and he goes over the Jack the Ripper case files

He finds her gorgeous with lush curves and to good for an illegitimate son

Anna thinks he is an arrogant drunk, but knows he is innocent and very good at investigating


Andrew discovers that Anna is a great sounding board for the case and asks her medical help with a victim

Anna is thrilled to actually have a man who respects her mind and she has an amazing time sneaking into locked doors, discussing the case, asked for her advice and his kisses are rocking her world, too
Andrew realizes that Anna is his new addiction and he must kiss, caress and always craves her


Murders are still terrorizing London and they use Andrew's investigational skills with her medical expertise and form an 1889 CSI team! Can Andrew realize he deserves love too? Will Anna's love heal her wounded hero? Can she embrace her inner bad girl? Will Andrew's Anna addiction help or destroy him? Who is the unseen Jack the Ripper? Will Anna and Andrew discover they are stronger together, before it's to late? When will Anna stitch a straight and not crooked incision?I absolutely loved this Robyn DeHart sexy and mysterious read
I love a heroine with an inner strength that helps her live her live, her way

Anna defies the woman's role of her time and wants to make a difference with her life as a doctor

Going against the world's image of anything takes courage and Anna has it in spades
Andrew was such a wounded hero with all his mother's hatred and she deserved a slap upside her head

He has also a man before his time, because he thought women had value and intelligence

He accepted Anna as she was and he learned to accept himself flaws and all
The steamy scenes had my toes curl and I had to turn up my A/C because my Kindle was getting really warm
My only complaint was that I wanted Anna to deliver, the Dowager Duchess, her much deserved slap and I hope Ms
DeHart puts in her next Dangerous Liaisons book


This amazing tale had mystery, witty and smart characters, suspenseful action, a fantastic romance between two people who complimented one another and it was an awesome world to visit and keep in my book cosmos


Ms
DeHart earned and so deserves my top score of 5 fingers up and 10 toes and my humble THANKS for writing this for us all to enjoy!

$REVIEW.: This cozy mystery has it all &#8211; humor, mystery, drama and a dash of romance. The author weaves all of these things together to perfection. An intriguing storyline to make this a real page-turner. Just when you think you&#8217;ve solved the case, another clue is tossed in to change everything. If you like to guess &#8220;whodunit&#8221; along with the characters, this is the story for you.  It&#8217;s the perfect mystery story - a little more grittier than the usual cozy.The characters are well developed and practically come to life on each page. LynDee Walker gives us a heroine with the strength to carry this book on her own. To make things even more interesting, our heroine gets two hot guys &#8211; total opposites. One is a mafia king and the other an ATF agent. Shades of Janet Evanovich&#8217;s Stephanie Plum trying to choose which guy she wants.  The bad boy vs. the good guy.This is the second book of the &#8220;A Headlines in High Heels Mystery&#8221; series. I didn&#8217;t read the first one and it didn&#8217;t really matter, but I definitely want to catch up. Fortunately, I only have to read one to catch up and I have that one on my Kindle already. I don&#8217;t think the book suffers if you read it on its own, I just want to know the characters better and want to start from the beginning.A great &#8220;new-to-me-author&#8221;!FTC Disclosure: The author provided me with a copy of this book to review for this book tour. This did not influence my thoughts and opinions in any way. All opinions expressed are my own.

$REVIEW.: First let me say that I have the utmost respect for Paula Huntley and her husband, for what they did, and for the lives they touched
Her writing was just enough to show the day to day lives of these people who have gone through so much
I wish more people would take a more active role in the world around them

It would be a better world if they did.However, the more I read the book the more frustrated I got

The book was a collection of horrific stories

People need to know that this happened

 But much was missing

While she provided us with a picture of the crumbling war torn town, she did little to give us any historical background


What was the culture like, who were the famous artists, statesmen, writers? What was Kosovo (and the entire region for that matter) like before the war, befor Tito

What were the politics that lead to decisions years ago which fired up the conflict? And where on earth was a good map of the region?  I realize that I was probably asking for too much


But the blurb by Jason Elliot raised my expectations


It is good, esp if you know nothing about the region


But I really did want more.

It's preceded by an introduction on the Enlightenment (!) presumably to suggest gravitas (more scissors-and-paste) and an utterly prosaic prologue on the Ayatollah Khomeini whose relevance, other than scene-setting, is hard to see

On the madness of crowds, instead of Charles Mackay (who, to be fair, is allowed a walk-on part later) we get a clipping from Schiller! Even as journalism this is leaden


How could such lazy and self-satisfied work meet with such approbation? Oh I see, he's supposed to be 'amusing'


Which must refer to stylistic flourishes like (p30) the 'denizens' of Wall Street and 'as it transpired'


For the most part his style is inoffensive, but the only wit I picked up was Peter Drucker's observation that people use the word guru because charlatan's too longAs self-help (#2) grows ever more mainstream - we wallow in it! - Wheen's flying visit feels both tired and dated
The all-but-missing elephant in Wheen's room is God, the place from which thinking about mumbo-jumbo generally takes off (s/he gets a measly ten pages), and politics shouldn't be very far behind, but that area's carefully ringfenced in Wheen's - as in all right-thinking people's - mind

As it transpires, I'm outa here


Swiftian? More like sugar-rich breakfast food


If only there was a bibliography* to wean you onto a more serious diet (to unwheen you, in a word; Mackay would make a good start) but that isn't what this is about

Hey, even journalists gotta eat! (What, all of them?) This is the way the world ends, not with a bang but a smirk
He's good on apologists for 9/11 (we were there) but in another life I can picture Wheen among the wheelerdealers
'Hey guys, let's have another round!' And the sell-out goes on: in February the London Guardian, whose readers are Wheen's natural constituency, agreed a deal with Unilever promising a 'collaborative and participative approach to developing brand stories that resonate among highly engaged communities'
Beyond satire

Something like Thomas Frank's One Market Under God is vastly more joined-up, more readable - and more fun* There are notes; but the Susan Sontag paragraph which 'shocked many of her fellow-liberals' in 1982, like Terry Eagleton's paragraph on page 83 or the half-page of Irigaray (p88), are not given a source
Did someone say slapdash? Guess that's what comes of cobbling together a comedy routine out of one's clippings file

I liked the characters, but I got a bit of reader whiplash as the main characters went from being enamored with each other to despising each other very quickly, back and forth.

$REVIEW.: I must confess, it took me several attempts to get into this book. Why? You cannot start this book expecting just to take it in bits and pieces as time comes your way. No way. I mean, we are entering into a war zone. We are undercover. Lives are at stake. Split second decisions must be made. You cannot lose your focus. You cannot get sidetracked. You must be disciplined, determined and fully committed. Really, each time I started the book and found myself having to answer the phone, cook dinner or other such events, I had to go back and re-read portions to regain my focus.Ronie Kendig does not just tell a story. She creates events, establishes relationships, builds communities. Her books are not for the faint of heart, nor are they for those looking for a quick lighthearted read. You must determine which side you are on and how committed you really are. There are some unexpected events and you must be willing to make adjustments along the way.Aspen is someone I could be friends with. Just like all of Ronie's heroines she is tough - she has to be - but she also has a sweet and open nature that makes you want to know her.Dane ... he is a mans man. He is constantly fighting the demons of his past but not in a way that becomes annoying to the reader. No, he is strong and controlled. There is no doubt that he is a very dangerous man, but that's what makes him so intriguing. The contrast between Dane and Aspen is glaring and stark but they blend and work very well together.There are other relationships throughout the book that explode from the page making you want to spend time with each character. Then of course there is Talon; a wounded warrior who is in the process of healing and learning to trust again. Talon, who shoulders the hope of the team. Talon, who also must determine where his loyalty lies and whose side he is on.Again I warn you. Don't begin this mission until you are willing to fully engage.

$REVIEW.: This strong introduction to Kimberly Kinrade's The Seduced Saga is a unique version of Romeo and Juliet, with a hot paranormal twist

It only took a couple of pages for me to become completely hooked


I loved the way the book switched perspectives..
sometimes when authors do this it can be kind of off-putting, but Kimberly Kinrade pulls it off well, without over complicating the story

I loved the characters, especially Rose who is very realistic and not your typical, boring, whiny damsel in distress


Her dark power is scary, but also intriguing


As is the Community in which she lives
You can't help but want to know more.

$REVIEW.: I expect quality items from Focus on the Family, but this copy of Oliver Twist{Radio Theater}, exceeded my expectations.In a culture in which our children are bombarded by television, video games, and other visually stimulating outlets of entertainment, my husband and I have sought out ways to build their auditory skills. Thus, we began to incorporate audio books and audio dramas into our day.And so far, this rendition of the Charles Dickens classic is a winner in our home! While it's recommended for ages 12+, all of our children (except the 16 month old), enjoyed it. Even our 4 year old was captivated by the sounds and music. We started listening to it in the van while running errands and I think everyone was sad when we returned home or had to stop, because we couldn't wait to hear what would happen next!My oldest daughter is a book worm. While she enjoys reading, she commented on how much the music and character voices brought the story to life, but was still able to use her imagination as the story played out in her mind.While our younger children enjoyed listening to the CDs, there are definitely some intense moments, so please use your own discretion when playing this for little ones. My husband wondered if we should skip a few moments forward a couple of times.Overall, this CD collection provided hours of entertainment for our family and great discussion! The CD's alone provide over 5 1/2 hours of audio, but we kept pausing to talk about what was happening and discuss possible consequences as well as cultural differences and how would our children respond if they were in Oliver's shoes. Learning that his character is only nine, hit home with them, and as the characters became more real in their imagination, the more they were intrigued.Including in the set is a DVD of behind the scenes footage, as well as info on modern-day orphans.If you enjoy Radio Theater or looking for a set to play for your family, we highly recommend this set. Our family is already looking forward to listening to it again!

$REVIEW.: This book came out in 1993 and was one of the first publications in this traveler's literary companion series, a beautiful attempt to introduce a wide range of foreign writers to English-language readers. It contained 26 works by 20 writers. There were 23 short stories and 3 excerpts from novels.The oldest writers in the collection were Carmen Lyra (1888-1949), Mario Gonz&aacute;lez Feo (1897-1969) and Max Jim&eacute;nez (1900-47). The most recent were Alfonso Chase (1945-), Alfredo Aguilar (1959-) and Uriel Quesada (1962-). Others included Carlos Luis Fallas (1909-65), a writer of the working class and social protest who's been called one of the nation's most widely read authors; Yolanda Oreamuno (1916-56); Joaqu&iacute;n Guti&eacute;rrez (1918-2000); Fabi&aacute;n Dobles (1918-97) and Julieta Pinto (1922-), who were called major voices; Carmen Naranjo (1928-), who appears to be among the writers most frequently translated into English; Abel Pacheco (1933-), recently the nation's president; and Quince Duncan (1940-), who was described as a chronicler of Costa Rica's blacks. Of all the authors, five were women.As far as could be determined, the pieces ranged from the 1930s (Lyra, Jim&eacute;nez, Oreamuno) to the 1990s (Naranjo, Chase). Three-fourths of the works came from the 1960s to 90s, the rest from the 1930s and 40s.The works covered the north and south, the Caribbean and Pacific coasts, the capital/the central valley, and a mountainous area in the north. A final section contained stories on the nation as a whole and was one of the strongest sections. In general, the longer pieces were most enjoyed.The introduction provided little background on the nation's literary development. Judging from info on the Internet, the modern literature dates to the late 1800s. Trends over the following decades have included influence from European literary traditions; an opposing preference for local themes; nationalism and social protest; modernism (with less impact than elsewhere in Latin America); realism; and occasionally magical realism.A number of the stories in the collection showed a great sensitivity to nature, focusing on the harvesting of fan palms, the screeching of cicadas, tropical rain, steam rising from the earth, the sound, smell and taste of the sea, as well as descriptions of trees, flowers, frogs, birds and lizards (Jim&eacute;nez, Oreamuno, Quesada, Dobles, Rima de Vallbona, Aguilar, Naranjo, Fallas).A few employed magical realism -- applying to reality some exaggeration and absurdity, or blending hallucination and reality (Jim&eacute;nez, Oreamuno, Naranjo, Aguilar). Others drew attention directly or in passing to social inequity or untoward foreign influence (Lyra, Dobles, Vallbona, Jos&eacute; Le&oacute;n S&aacute;nchez, Pacheco). One of these, by S&aacute;nchez, was written from the point of view of a young girl trying to escape poverty and showed well the many obstacles: lack of health, sanitation, nutrition, money, learning, sexual education, role models, and protection from those who meant harm.Another piece (Ducoudray) managed to combine protest with magical realism, in the form of mysterious pairs of wings brought by an unnamed company from overseas 90 years before, which claimed occasional victims and spread contagious diseases. Other stories were concerned more with urban alienation and sexual frustration (Samuel Rovinski) or the inability to fathom another person's motivations (Chase).Stylistically, among the more interesting pieces for this reader were one by Dobles, in the form of a diary kept by two Americans competing against an unnamed fruit conglomerate in the early 1900s. One by Pacheco, in the form of voices telling their stories in a manner akin to Spoon River Anthology. And a monologue by Guti&eacute;rrez, in which a man at the end of his rope recounted his adventures and rued the passing of time.In one connection or another, a handful of the stories mentioned the unnamed conglomerate, which the introduction identified as the American-owned United Fruit Company. One of the largest employers in Central America before World War II, it appears also in the pages of authors like Asturias, Neruda and Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez. In the present collection, it was shown building railroads to the interior, setting up company towns, driving small competitors out of business, and buying on favorable terms from local banana farmers. An excerpt in the collection from a novel by Fallas--Mamita Yunai (1941)--showed the comradeship of the hard-working construction gangs it employed.Readers who enjoy all these things ought to enjoy this collection, it's fine as a travel guide, and it's a very useful introduction to the nation's writing over the 20th century, for which there appear to be no other widely available collections in English.There wasn't the social satire of writers like Brazil's Machado de Assis or Mexico's Juan Jos&eacute; Arreola, the concern with humorous tales and social customs of Peru's Ricardo Palma and the Dominican Republic's Juan Bosch, or the concern with Indian subjects of a writer like Mexico's Rosario Castellanos. The tragic sense of life in some of the pieces wasn't conveyed quite as powerfully for this reader as in the best writing of Uruguay's Horacio Quiroga, Brazil's Graciliano Ramos or Mexico's Juan Rulfo. And other pieces weren't as dazzling as the best magical realism from writers of the 1960s boom like Fuentes and Cort&aacute;zar, a precursor such as Borges and successors like Puig and Arenas, or experimental on the order of Lezama Lima, Cabrera Infante, or Sarduy. Still, there was much to enjoy.Other collections containing Costa Rican writers include When New Flowers Bloomed: Short Stories by Women Writers from Costa Rica and Panama (1991) and Contemporary Short Stories from Central America (1994).

$REVIEW.: Eating LizzyAesop's fable is so apt giving rise immediately to philosophical issues that have faced man from dawn of time.  The Monkey See and Monkey Do is chilling.This is an electrifying read. I could hardly put the book down. The opening chapter was impressive with the ominous introduction in the court, giving dignity and respect for a story that examines the highest and most basic of human instincts.  Jayson's interior dialogue also intrigues instantly shaping his character.I have tried to steer away from the philosophy in this book but found I could not; it is too strong, its message so powerful.  To my mind, the book in its deepest layer begs a philosophical debate between the reader and the written word as to whether a person's spiritual aspirations can overcome the basic animal urges for survival. What is really true, can the courts of law really address such issues of life and death?The prose is succinct and flows naturally.  The plot is carefully developed and structure sound so that the reader follows the storyline enthralled. The characters are sensitively formed with Jayson's remorseless steely logic following a strict cause and effect which could really be an excuse to indulge in the basest of human instincts. This is revealed in his dealings with Deborah. Victoria is again a flawed character, albeit she did seek to save her soul when thinking of confessing to Jayson. Little Lizzy, a child of goodness is the only light in that dark cave, where the heartbreaking pleas of little Lizzie and her killer's response is echoed in Aesop's fable, the  Blood of the Lamb is shed.  It is horrifying to read the Leyton's  sheer lack of remorse after the event.  I will not reveal anymore about the storyline and its incredible ending, as it is for the reader to discover.Albeit I am giving in to deconstruction, in my mind, this astounding story asks us to reflect on where we truly are on the continuum of spirituality? Are our ethics and morals just a thin veneer? Are thousands of years of religiosity and philosophy so easily divested as were little Lizzy's clothes?  Would we choose to die comforting another or would we lunge for the law of necessity.  How far are we from the Homo erectus with only a stone to cut his meat?This is an incredible work that uses the darkness of the cave, the light of the Sun, survival, cause and effect and spirituality.  This is a work to respect in all its layers.  I shall definitely be reading more of this writer's work.Highly recommended

$REVIEW.: In this novel we meet Aisling, who finds out, after a series of events that she is a faerie changeling.Along with this comes the knowledge that she has a 'sister', well the girl she was exchanged with, and she decided to find her but soon learns that she has been taken by the Shadow People.I think that is secondary plot, though I am still not positive. As the name we also have the plot about the actual Dream Crystal about which the book is named. We get three worlds in this novel-- the human world I guess, the shadow world and the land of dreams, which is where all the fairies live.We meet a lot of interesting people from all three among them are, Genevieve a human and Aisling's best friend. Eileen, a faerie. Ith, the shadow king.One of the reasons this novel only gets three stars was because of several little things that bothered me. It was nothing that affected the story as a whole but did cause a slow pace at times.Example: There were many character in the book and while some such as Aisling, Erin and Elaine was easy to remember we get a lot of other characters, mostly male now that I think back on it, that I couldn't really keep straight.Above is a very vague premiss of what this book is about I would try to give a more in-depth one but just do not think it is possible without giving everything away.When it came down to it I find I could not love Aisling, like her yes, but not love her. She just seemed slightly artificial to me and kind of a tease if you will. Also, I never felt a very strong connection with her, which is strange as the novel is only her POV.Altogether I really did like the novel and think it is a good first book and look forward to see more in the series.I would recommend this novel to anyone interested in a novel about fairies or a slightly long fantasy.*I received an Ebook copy of this book for free to review from the author.

That being said, Kate's Song: Forever After In Apple Lake is one of the best I have read


I received it free from Amazon for my Kindle & may buy it in book form so that I might  loan it out to friends & family
YES, IT IS THAT GOOD!!  The book gives us insight & an opportunity to be able to understand the "heart" of the Amish people concerning their children's  desire to taste the outside world of the "Englischers"

Also, to see the love, hope, & strength they have in letting them find their own way persuing a path that might lead them away from family & God,but hopefully back to both
It is a Christian based story, with biblical references, reflecting the Amish religion based life
The author had me amused, angry, wanting to do "personal damage" to a couple of people, guessing what would come next & reaching for my box of tissues
Combine those feelings with "I don't want the book to end!!" I have to say IT WAS A GREAT BOOK!!

$review_text.: Reviewed by Joe Graham for Reader Views (1/07)Most of us have visited nursing homes and have been sad and depressed at the frail, unhappy people that we have seen there

We feel bad for the people who are in the home whether they are friends or family and we hope that a similar fate will not be part of our future

 Thomas, in "In the Arms of Elders," attempts to change the way we think about the elderly with what he calls "A Parable of Wise Leadership and Community Building."The book tells the fictional story of a young couple, medical professionals, Bill and Jude who think they have all the answers about how to deal with the elderly

On a vacation, they are shipwrecked on a mysterious island named Kallimos, and they are forced to rethink the way they think about the elderly


With wise council and stories, two of the elder residents of the island, Hannah and Haleigh help Bill and Jude adjust to life on Kallimos.In her first lesson, Hannah teaches them that the three plagues of the elderly are loneliness, helplessness and boredom
 Does that sound very much like the atmosphere of most nursing homes?  Then Hannah goes on to teach them that "Elders exist because they show us how to make a community
As we give to them, they give to us their wisdom, their experience, their affection
When we come together to meet their needs, we learn how to live as human beings."After a year on the island, Bill and Jude are washed back into their life in the Other World and at this point the parable ends and Thomas talks about the changes that can and should be made in nursing homes


With his wife, he has created a different kind of world for people living in nursing homes called The Eden Alternative
 His Eden Alternative philosophy is currently in practice in every state in the U.S

and all over the world
 The Green House, another project of the author is a new way of looking at elderly care and it "is inspired by the richness of close personal relationships and the healing power of community."I would recommend the book to anyone who thinks that there must be something better than most nursing homes that run rampant with the three plagues of loneliness, helplessness and boredom
 Thomas gives the reader a great deal to consider but he does it in a very loving, comforting way


After reading the book, most readers will be curious to find out more about the Eden Alternative and The Green House and the author provides a list of contact information and web sites.Thomas and his wife are in the forefront of a movement to change the face of elder care as we currently know it and hopefully the changes will be in place as the baby boom generation finds itself in need of that care

We can only hope that the love and respect for elders and for keeping them a vital part of the community that Thomas espouses in "In the Arms of Elders" will be the norm in  elder care in the years to come.Received book free of charge.

The romance had many unexpected twists and turns with sadness and sorrow thrown in due to misunderstandings - some that went back years. There were also chuckles and laughter along the way given some of the antics of the various characters as well as plenty of wooing and romance. The story would build up and you would think you knew what was coming but the author would take you down a different path. This happened several times throughout the story but it just added to the plot. The ending was what I was rooting for but once again the author got you there in a totally unexpected way. This is the second book of Maddie James that I've read for a review but it won't be my last. I love the way she writes and will look for more of her books in the future. I recommend this book - maybe you too can uncover another favorite author.Favorite Quote: "Relax Lucki," he whispered. "Just relax. I'll take care of everything." He stroked several loose locks of hair from her forehead, then reaching back, undid the elastic holding her ponytail and let her hair fall free.Lucki searched his face and her breath caught in her throat. That he would go to this length to please her, to woo her...what did it mean? Was Sam, the boy next door, really in love with her. Was this forever?

$review_text.: Wow!Wow!Wow!What an amazing book.  The prologue sets you up the entire book like &#34;saayyyy whatttt!&#34;  You're left wondering when the other shoe is going to drop.  How it's going to be done.  The book was long, in a healthy way.  I find a lot of books these days are so short and you're left wondering where the rest of the book is.It was truly an amazing book.  I hated how the book ended at first and then I continued reading and &#34;cliff hangar&#34; took on an entirely new meaning to me.  It's one thing to leave a bit of suspense, but it's another to completely obliterate a person, waiting in suspense for the pieces to be put back together to realize they won't be.A book that can pull that kind of emotion from me.... Two Thumbs up!Thanks Belle! I look forward to reading more of your work!

$REVIEW.: I like Lonely Planet, but I always get the impression that it fails to show which are indeed the best attractions in each country, region, state or town. As you move around the book, you see many repetitions, because in many places the things to do are the same. for example, you can probably find 50 or more places to go hiking or kayaking, but surely some are better than others. For people who are about to cross the world to see Canada, it's crucial to know where the best options for each activity are. Of course, there are some suggested itineraries, but I found them to be a little disappointing. However, the book is good on the whole and you can get a good deal of information from it.
$SUMMARY.: Good book, but fails to highlight clearly the best things to do.

$REVIEW.: "FOGGY DAZE (rhyming, bedtime, reading, children, kids, short, stories)" by Peter Collier is a very cute and entertaining bed time story for young children.The idea is great:  What does a town do when there is thick fog obscuring sight? Listen and be amused what can happen in the fog.Collier has a knack for rhyming for children and without the pretence of other, overly constructed books, he levels with his audience and provides fun for both the parents and the children.I wish there was a way to fill the book with the great illustrations Collier uses in his other books.If you have children in that age group, don't pass by these books.

$REVIEW.: The Marquess of Cake is a fun plot that you don't see that often in the romance genre.  The heroine is not our typical aristocrat.  In fact her family is &#34;new&#34; money and she actually has had to work to help with her father's business.  The success of his business has lead to a knighthood, and the challenge to her independence when her family expects her to change her thinking and outlook on marriage and family duty.  Enter in the &#34;Marquess&#34; with a sweet tooth who notices her working at her family's tea shop, not realizing who she is.  You have to love a man who is addicted to desserts!What I enjoyed was the plot using the historical changes that were going on as British aristocracy was changing with no money to support their titles and possessions.  Forcing them to look elsewhere to look for bigger bank accounts with rich American heiresses and the new trade money, their entry into the upper crust of society brought along with it not only old societal baggage but their challenge of carving a new presence in such a changing society.For a fun read, this is a good book.  I can't wait to read the rest of this series.

$REVIEW.: I was intrigued by the author's inclusion of the New Jersey pine barrens as well as the unique cover art


I was surprised by how easily I related to each character
My favorite character was the gardener

I thought of him as an angel
With each mention of this gentle man, I was reminded how few &#34;gardeners&#34; we meet in life
And of the fact that often when there are no gardeners we must use our own gifts of love and mercy and do as the gardener does ;)
Threaded throughout this book were many inspirational and redeeming reminders that we must treat others with dignity to make the world a better place.Without being a spoiler, I was quite pleased with Kate's ultimate decision as well as her honesty and her forthright struggles to be a faithful wife, mother, and advocate for those without a voice
She was quite precious with her grandmother


And I truly savored the time she spent discovering the past in her grandmother's hope chest

I believe every woman should have such a special and cherished time with her past!Ms

Hawke has left the door wide open for a Bellehaven book series
I also could imagine this book featured on television (Lifetime or Hallmark channel)
If so, I believe it would be helpful to explain (possibly in a forward?) Kate's husband Joe's post traumatic stress disorder as I did misunderstand his behavior while reading the book

I saw him as immature and a bit bratty, but he was in fact suffering from ptsd


I do understand why the author discreetly framed this issue as well as other social issues due to the time in which the story took place.I truly enjoyed Bellehaven

I hope that everyone who reads this book will adopt a bit of each character and learn from every character's passions as well as mistakes
I sense the author's intent was introspection on the part of the reader

I just felt this book's purpose was not merely to entertain, but to inspire each reader as well.My personal takeaway? Oh to be a much better gardener!!Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this product free from Emerald Stone Press

$review_text.: Star Rating: 3.5 starsI was given an arc in exchange for an honest review.Impulses begins with us meeting Samantha Kennedy, 24, meandering through life, going from one casual hookup to another, we can tell almost immediately that she is broken, she is harboring a dark past that has shattered her self worth and left her using promiscuity as a means keep her heart safe, pushing commitment and relationships away, never really letting anyone in, she uses sex for the instant gratification and confidence boost.Hayden Wentworth is the epitome of classy, confident, sexy lawyer, he is Wentworth & Associates, a renowned practice, outwardly he is everything you would expect in a successful lawyer, but inwardly he is withdrawn, and full of self doubt. He is harboring secrets of his own, a past that left him broken and unwilling to attempt love or a relationship, he is also Samantha's new boss.How do 2 broken people fight the attraction they share, how does giving in to those impulses give them the push to heal themselves, to have a chance at love again when they both believe they are safer without it?The first 30% was slow building for me, Brock creates such a vividly descriptive world, by 50% I was hooked, I wanted, no I needed to know that two broken people had a chance, could find and forgive themselves and in turn find love and each other. Impulses is filled with enough angst to keep it real, enough heartbreak to keep you in their corner cheering them on, and is ultimately for me about that journey of forgiveness and second chances, that if you're lucky will lead you to your HEA. Congratulations V.L. Brock on a beautiful debut, I can't wait to see what you do next.

$review_text.: As I am well on the way to master level starting out from scratch I think I can give a good overview.Fisrtly most chess players have a tendency to jump from book to book, thats a lot of time wasted

What I like about this book is all the key info on tactics is in the book so you do not have to get tactics info from several books


Yes thats a lot of time saving and money saved


All the keys areas (Pins, Discovered check, Xray etc) are included with both classic and modern examples
There are exercises at the end of each chapter to test your and reinforoce your knowledge.Two years ago I went all the way through this book and jumped about 200 elo points


You can do about 10 pages each day easily (Approx 1 to 1 1/2 hours)


So you can finish the book in a month
Every 6 mths I revise the book and each time I understand the examples to a deeper level
When I first went through it was understanding that these ideas existed (pins for example)


Now when I look at the diagram I see the motifs, how and why these tactics exist e.g


Bishop control of key diagonal, over worked piece, etc

Its amazing now on ICC I see the motifs and my opponents just seem to place the pieces where I want them to, and the combination results


So this book covers it all along with the next volume (King in Jeapody) they are all you need to reach to master level


Especially good in this book is the calculation chapter which is over 40 pages long and is the last chapter
You would need to buy Kotov's Think like a GM and Soltis's book to get this info


How do we calculate variations?  Its laid out in a simple yet effective way
In a nutshell all the info is easy to understand, comprehensive, practical and can be reviewed again and again
This book should raise your Elo about 100 to 200 points
Yes there is a lot of off beat advertising in the book; However the secret Russian method is there, 1) The best most efficient examples so you maximise study time

2) Ideas are reinforced with end of chapter questions that you can solve under time pressure
3)There is chess culture, examples are from all chess eras, today's ideas do not originate in a vacuum they progress from the greats of old (Capablance, Alekhine, Morphy etc...)


I will also be reviewing the Pirc &amp; Just the facts books in separate reviews


Thanks, email me if you want other chess book reviews (I have over 60 books, that I use not 1000 on the shelf lol)

$REVIEW.: For those new to ancient civilizations, or those who have dabbled in the past, this book ties together a lot of the new discoveries, ancient myths, and FACTS about beings who inhabited earth c
100,000 years ago, and it leaves one wondering what else is yet to be discovered/disclosed
Although the second half of the book was a bit uninteresting (to me), the appendix did have some more valueable insights


Some day (soon, hopefully) those with a stronghold on the truth (i.e
the Vatican) will relent, and all mankind will be aware of this information, and maybe history will be rewritten (again)

One can only hope (and maybe the same for the facts and truth about 9-11!)

I would hate for my grandchildren to grow up not knowing the truth about history, UFOs, and bad things done by the powers that be.

$review_text.: The third book in the Vampires in America series is full action, suspense and romance.Master vampire of New York City, Rajmund Gregor bows to know one except his sire the Vampire Lord of Northeastern US.  When he called to Buffalo to solve a problem for his sire, he finds that maybe his Lord has gotten too old and is losing his mind.  Young women are missing and the cops are thinking vampires are behind it, but there is more going on than that it seems.  Sarah Stratton has a secret, one that she&#8217;s never shared with anyone and it could destroy her carefully constructed life, but it&#8217;s one she may have to share with a vampire to save the lives of the missing women.This fast paced plot keeps readers on their toes with lots of suspense and action.  The tension builds as the enemy remains hidden and the action gets the adrenalin pumping. The author describes the story with vivid images and great details making the reader feel as if they are part of the story.The chemistry between Raj and Sarah explodes from the pages and the sex scenes are spectacularly steamy. The romance definitely has some issues and both characters have strong personalities that clash at different times throughout the story adding drama and spice to the story.  The supporting characters are engaging as well and definitely leave the reader wanting to know more.The author has created a wonderful world of vampires that includes their politics and hierarchies, one that straddles the human world in a way that the mortals know that they are there, but try to pretend that they don&#8217;t know anything about vampires.I found this book to be a very enjoyable read that I couldn&#8217;t put down. This one takes us away from Cyn and Raphael, but they do put in a couple of cameo appearances and we get a taste of more of the Vampires in America.  I love how she ended this one to, such a tease, I can&#8217;t wait for the next book.

I made the mistake of reading it at midnight and the man had to get up early!The story itself as always was put together with the precision that only Poppet can perform! I was truly amazed at not only the content but how gracefully it was portrayed! All I can say is Tantric Sex. If you don't know what that is Google it! Personally I like a good smut story like the next but when Poppet writes it, you come away feeling clean. Women love a good shag just as much as men do but seemingly don't have to have the same stimuli. The scenes were more than just the good "in, out". I could actually use all 5 sense with this one and suddenly felt kind of voyeuristic. All women want a man that is as in-tune as Trystan is in this book. Linda is a lucky lady!!! As far as other reviews I've read about this story, personally if you can't use your imagination past the facts given, why do you bother reading?! I saw alot of shit reviews by small minded people. I guess this book isn't for everyone but if you wish to push the limits of what you know pick this up and get ready to google!!

$review_text.: No He Can't by Kevin McCullough, is the author's detailed presentation of how President Obama's agenda of "Hope and Change" is not, at all, the hope and change that the voters wanted. In twenty-one chapters, under four headings, the author gives several examples of Obama's policies backed up with extensive notes that have taken our country down the wrong path. One example that really disturbed me is that one of the very first things Obama did after taking office as President was to authorize the funding of abortions in other countries.The four headings the author covers are: Economics, "National Insecurity", Erosion Of Rights, Accountability To Caesar. Then in several chapters under each heading, he goes into detail about the serious mistakes Obama has made. At the end of each chapter, he points out what can and must be done to put America back on the right path.The author contends that there is still hope for the country but action must be taken soon to rectify the failed policies and prevent the danger America is headed for.When I first began reading this book, I was disappointed and really concerned because the author presents so well how Obama has fooled the thousands of people, (including me), who voted for him. I feel this book is one of the "must reads" because it really is a wake-up call.I received this book free from the Thomas Nelson Publisher's Bookszeeze review program. I was not required to write a favorable review. I was only asked to be honest. The words are my own.

My 10 year old and I found it to be a bit scarier than other R.L. Stine books which can be a good or bad thing.

$review_text.: Dillon's Claim is the second book in the Dumen Ranch Series by Callie Croix.We first meet Dillon in book one, Deacon's Touch. I really like the timeline for this series. Book two takes place the same time as book one. Both revolve around a bachelorette weekend at the Dumen Ranch. The books tell the stories of what took place with different couples that were there. This is a new take on a series for me and I loved it.Dillon is the oldest of the Dumen boys who are running the ranch. He is former Air Force Special Ops and is used to being in control of every aspect of his life, especially in the bedroom.Charissa and Dillon were friends who let the friendship line dissolve and shared some steamy kisses a year ago. She knew what kind of a lover he was and knew she couldn't get involved with a dominant man again. She had a horrible experience in the past and even though her body knows what it wants in the bedroom her mind won't let her except it. She leaves her fantasies and desires behind and skips town without as much as a goodbye.She knows heading into the weekend at the ranch she is going to have to face Dillon again.Dillon is such a caring, sensitive, gentle guy. I loved their story. I loved that Dillon not only showed her but helped her understand that a BDSM relationship is not one sided but an exchange of power. I loved the way he lets her know that what she craves in the bedroom is normal, and nothing to be ashamed of. This book is filled with passion and steamy sex, but it also tells a beautiful story of two people who have to overcome a lotof obstacles in order to get their HEA.This is a short read, but don't let that discourage you. A good author has the ability to tell a complete story with lots of emotion and chemistry in a short format. That is exactly what we get with Ms. Croix. I can't wait to see what else she has planned for the rest of the brothers at the Dumen Ranch.

$review_text.: He followed her because he wanted to own her. She trusted him because she wanted excitement. There&#8217;s a saying that curiosity can kill &#8230; but Valerian Kimble is beginning to learn that satisfaction might just be worse.So, some quite adult themes in this YA novel, the first in the &#8220;Horrorscape&#8221; series from Nenia Campbell. Valerian is a fairly typical 14 year old girl, drifting through life, friendship and school, when one day she finds something lurking in her locker&#8230;something that disturbs her equilibrium and sets off a disturbing chain of events.This was a cleverly written book, where the the author manages to keep the reader off kilter by mixing up your typical vapid teenage goings on (who fancies who, who is the biggest bitch etc etc) with a creeping sense of foreboding as Val feels threatened but is not sure why. And in typical teenage fashion, her feelings get all mixed up and she makes some horrendously bad choices. No Val, boys who actually like you in a normal human way do NOT act like that!There are some great characters in the mix &#8211; Gavin is complex without becoming a caricature and his diary is probably one of the best parts of the novel as a whole. I was actually very fond of James, who I hope will get more depth added to him in the future books (which I shall certainly be reading) as although he played his part here, he felt like he had a lot more to say. Val herself is naive yet hopeful and her friends are a good eclectic mix that help the story move along at a perfect pace.The story itself creeps up on you &#8211; as Val feels more and more threatened you are right there with her &#8211; and if you, like me, are the type who talks out loud to characters while you are reading about them you WILL shriek at her at various intervals. And at a few other people..If I have one teeny tiny little complaint its that I could not align myself with the way that Val&#8217;s parents acted &#8211; no parent I know (and I&#8217;m one myself) would allow Val to do what she does towards the end. People who have already read this will know what I&#8217;m referring to but if you havent yet I am not going to spoil it. Having said that, it kind of has to happen that way in order for the story to continue &#8211; so some dramatic license is allowed and welcomed because it means that now we will find out what is next for Val and Co.All in all a great read and despite the violent aspects and the dark subject matter, it also works well as a cautionary tale for young adults and works well.Happy Reading Folks!**Purchased for the Kindle via Amazon UK***

The story base line was a woman had testified against the man who she witnessed murder of a business associate. The murderer was released on a technical issue and Pamela Hays ran ending up in Key West. She met a man who needed to marry a woman with outstanding characterists who would help him prove to DCF that he was a good parent so he could retain custody of his niece, plus Pam needed a place to hide. It was only an okay story I kept waiting to get to the part where the author made the reader "Cry Uncle" and that didn't happen for me.

$review_text.: I'm 42, a former avid weight lifter who is in the weight room for the first time in 12 years. My goals are simple: get fit and stronger overall. I wanted to read a book to inspire and educate me.  This book has done it, and fairly well.Despite the book being written by a man (yes, women are involved, but it's written by a man who brings it up fairly consistently throughout...), the information is good and not written in a condescending or overly hyped tone.  I learned new things about metabolism and was reminded of things I already knew, but had forgotten in the areas of diet and recovery phases.I didn't like the amount of book space taken up by recipes.  I think some basic guidelines would have been sufficient - at least for me.  I would have liked to have that space taken up by more info on a fitness routine or how to plan one of your own with more specific exercises outlined; perhaps using gym machines versus free weights in the examples. The recipes are good ones, but could really be in another book devoted solely to them.I like that there is a website dedicated to the book (selling it), that has links to 3 fitness forums.  I also like the first part of the book - which explains physiological issues associated with changing your body and the last half which addresses specific weight lifting exercises, explaining what muscles are worked for each exercise and how to do the exercise.The bottom line: it's a good book with the major point being 'women can lift heavier weights and not become bulky, but rather lean and strong'.  It's nothing revolutionary, but it dispels myths and gives women of any age a solid approach to fitness that includes weight training.

 It's an enthralling story, full of rich characters from all walks of life


 It's one of the best books I read this summer.That being said, the first 200 pages were very difficult to get through


 It is full of fictional cultural and technological references that are used without introduction, as if the reader is already familiar with the world

 Maybe those references were better explained in previous Warhammer 40,000 books, but as this was my first, I was completely lost

 I gave up the first time I tried, and the book sat on my shelf for three years before it worked its way back to the top of my stack.I'm glad I persisted this time

 Once past the first 200 pages, the book is difficult to put down.

The mermaids are such a draw: carefree and wild, without a thought of anything but the present moment.This book was less about the mermaids than the others, and more about the consequences of Marina's action from book #2. It still manages to be a complete story that was easy to pick up and catch up to, even though I read the second one a few months and several books ago.Marina herself is annoying. She's selfish and insecure. She rarely seems to consider the consequences of her actions, and seems to have no idea hwo other people think and react. Her constant doubts about Ethan's feelings and motives are ridiculous. I want to shake her so bad when she gets going on her pity-party tirades.And yet I can't stop myself from reading the series. When's the next one out? Some time this year? Can't wait to see what the next adventure holds.

$review_text.: The old cliche goes that journalists are the first draft of history. This is true but it also speaks to the limitations of journalistic books. Pretty much all these limitations are prominent in this book. The author writes about the LRA with a good samaritan's eye. He talks about some of the theories concerning the formation of the LRA. He interviews some of the people that knew the leaders way back then. He also speaks briefly of Lakwada and the previous rebels.Toward the end of the book he indicts the Ugandan government for allowing the LRA to continue to operate in the north. They have every reason to keep it going since the government is located in the South and the presence of the LRA means international financial assistance. There's also some material about Sudan.But it all feels like a tour guide. There's not much insight into what makes the people behave the way they do. I finished this book feeling like I only got part of the story. Of course, there's a 1970s biography of Idi Amin that has the same problem and in both cases it's because the final chapter has yet to be written. THe LRA is still out there. They talk peace every so often but for the most part they are involved in a religious crusade. Even though some leaders die, it's still not working.Some day a better book about the LRA will be written. For now, it's as messy asGod's Chinese Son: The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom of Hong Xiuquan.

$REVIEW.: This story was another one of those where the men are all perfect (beautiful), the women are all perfect, everyone is rich, everyone wears name brands, etc, etc, etc. The author's fondness for certain name brands was distracting because it would pull me out of the story. The characters were always wearing this fancy brand or that fancy brand and I would be trying to think about what that means instead of reading the story. This is distracting and makes for a boring story. Instead of the author taking the time to think of how clothing or surroundings can be described to the reader, she simply states the brand and expects us to know what that would look like.

$REVIEW.: Most high school geometry students understand the concept of congruency, which manifests as a close interrelation and correspondence between two different quantities. For whatever reason, many marketers reject this fundamental principle at their own peril as they pursue radical, "outside the box" tactics for any and all products. Unfortunately, not every marketing tactic works for every product or service, and that is the premise behind Seth Godin's latest book titled Meatball Sundae. As unappetizing as that culinary concoction sounds, so to is incongruous marketing according to Godin. The author states that traditional manufactured goods represent the meatballs, while the whipped cream, sprinkles and cherry might be emerging Internet tactics such as adword buys, viral e-mails and blogs. While each might be good in their own right (meatballs vs. toppings), they're not necessarily effective when combined. However, Godin does  provide insight as to where such combinations might make sense as well as how companies can utilize and identify their best Internet opportunities. Soundview recommends this book because it takes a contrarian view to the conventional wisdom that every product or service needs a new media strategy - which makes sense in an incongruous sort of way.

 However the author has a lot of potential and I think this author will have some very good books out in the future.

$review_text.: I figured that Jon's done enough good for the personal training world to warrant a review here.True, if you're looking for a long read, this isn't it. But you should never have expected it to be in the first place. This is an ebook. A $5 ebook. The length that you may be looking for may not be there, but the information within is pretty solid.I've done a ton of self-research on the subject, and I still found the ebook very useful. It basically gives you the  bones of what you need to look into if you're going to start up online training. Is it a step by step guide? No. But it will give you a road map. A road map telling you in which direction you need to trod, and where you are going to have to put in a little bit of good ol' fashioned hard work.So, if you're looking into online training, buy the book. You'll be glad you did.

$REVIEW.: The Heart of Lies, A Paradise Valley Mystery: Book Twohas proven to be a five star sequel. The author was able to summarize each character with ease and efficiency. I never once felt I was "re-reading"The Scent of Lies, A Paradise Valley Mystery: Book One. Don't let the author's clean writing fool you, the passion and sexual tension between Private Investigator Emily and Detective Colin is delicious. This book sequel was very enjoyable to read and kept me turning the pages to help Emily find the clues to the two unsolved murder cases. If you like these two romance thrillers I recommend reading, Debra BorroughsThree Days in Seattle, a Novel of Romance and Suspense.

$REVIEW.: As a conservative, I was very interested to read this book. I don't consider myself a feminist, however a lot of what Kunin says is not so much feminism as it is a commentary on where our country has fallen short.  She does talk about how we have fewer women in congress than 77 of our developed counterparts in the world.  She also addresses the fact that women are paid an average of 77cents on the dollar compared to their male colleagues.  However the bigger issue that she brings up in this book, I feel is much more political than feminist. She discusses the idea of raising families and still having a career as one that has remained rather stagnant in our society-the cost of good, reliable childcare is still too high, and there are few companies that pay for family leave (for the mother or father).  These issues, although some may see them as women's issues, are more about the family as a whole-I do think women tend to shoulder more responsibility for raising children, however, we are seeing increasing numbers of men becoming stay-at-home-dads.  I appreciate the point of view of one of the most influential women in the feminist movement and hope that our current generation will continue the work those amazing women who have gone before us have started for not only women, but families! Overall, no matter what side of the aisle you sit on and whether or not you consider yourself a feminist, Kunin offers a great political discourse on what more needs to be done to truly achieve what we as a nation are striving for, a place of freedom, equality, and opportunity for everyone! That's not to say I agreed with everything she said, but her overall message is one of unity, which is something I believe our country greatly needs in these times!

The development of his son and the interactions with his escapades was areas you just turned the pages without reading them similar to the Invasion of Alaska book when he entered useless pages about his father.

$REVIEW.: 5 stars just doesn't seem like enough for me! Dearest Raine Miller, you have wrapped up the Blackstone Affair series PERFECTLY!! From Naked, to All In and then Eyes Wide Open, I have LOVED LOVED LOVED these characters and have become fully vested in their relationship. They've married, have a child on the way, they have THE best sex and traveled a long road in a short time. Their love is strong, their connection getting stronger and stronger as they build their family and their life together. And Ethan...OH MY...Ethan!!! He has the best lines... &#34;I cringed at her question, knowing there was only one answer I could give. Cluster.... mother....... load of steaming shi..&#34; (Those who've read it will know!)  CLASSIC Ethan mouth!! The sexiest, most foul mouthed Brit ever! I think I need some serious security detail!I'm a little at a loss for words because I just truly loved this series so much and I'm sad to see their story end. However as they say, all good things must come to an end and although I'm sad that they're story has been completed, I look forward to what Raine might have in store for some of the other characters. Maybe Ivan and Gabi? Maybe more Neil and Elaina? Maybe something with some cameo appearances by the Blackstone family??  Maybe baby Blackstone needs a christening??  Just something small...**wink, wink..hint, hint Raine** :) I'll take whatever I can get I just loved it SO MUCH! If you haven't read this series...GET IT NOW! You WILL NOT be disappointed!

$REVIEW.: My 12-yr-old son was the one who chose that his was an &#34;I loved it&#34; rating -- he loved the storyline and the story of strong friendships.As the mom, I appreciate a book that still builds on a strong moral base (human life over wealth, repeated forgiveness, the need to learn from life lessons, the need to be repentant, the value of appreciating others) while successfully teaching us things about cultural history that we didn't fully appreciate before.  The use of the courts in Rolf's homeland, the use of lawyers and the necessity of knowing the law, the ways the law tried to be fair, the tradition of looting for wealth being more important to many than saving human lives and the concept of &#34;fostering&#34; children at other courts/houses/lands are all included in this story.  This book is written in an old world style as if it is trying to copy the tone of the sagas and it makes reference to the sagas which I also considered valuable for my son's education.

$REVIEW.: I am so thrilled with getting Sicarius' POV that it doesn't even matter that the majority of this story he and Amaranthe are basically apart

Well, it doesn't matter MUCH
I loved and hated  the cliffhanger ending


I know Lindsay Buroker will complete this amazing series in a way that her fans will love and appreciate....I hope *cough*After five books and several novellas, being able to get inside our master assassins head was awe inspiring
I loved how the author wrote it and I really loved how Sicarius continued to notice his own thought processes having changed in the last year with Amaranthe

The fact that he is trying to figure out how to manage a sense of humor is a phenomenal gift, albeit unknowing, to Amaranthe and to his son Sespian

It's priceless the way the author has written his issues with how to deal with so many things that &#34;normal&#34; humans would know, I.e
how to comfort Amaranthe from nightmares, how to express that training is perhaps not the most important thing he'd like to do with her, etc
It's seeing him vulnerable that made me fall in love with Sicarius all over again.Amaranthe, Sicarius, Sespian and crew have returned to the capital city to plan a way to put Sespian back on the throne as emperor

As is true with this crowd, there is a lot of plotting, spying, fighting, hiding, training and much of it in costumes

Amaranthe devises a plan that has her infiltrating Forge while Sespian is trying to gather troops to his cause

So there's Amaranthe in a highly dangerous situation without Sicarius because he's at Sespians side in another highly dangerous endeavor


Pretty much the way Lindsay Buroker's world of the Emperor's Edge works.I am saddened knowing that in two months when the final story is released it will be the end
Although I am profoundly grateful to the author that the waiting isn't longer

I love this world and these characters the author has created and I will miss new stories of them

But I take solace in the fact that I can re-read to my hearts content.

$review_text.: I&#8217;ve been a fan of Michelle Valentine&#8217;s Black Falcon series from the beginning. I love these hot rockers and I love their stories. So I was so excited to sit down to read Trip&#8217;s story, Rock the Beat. It&#8217;s a wonderful story of love, hope, and strength. And of course there&#8217;s lots of hotness. Trip is well, a trip.  As Black Falcon&#8217;s awesome drummer he&#8217;s cocky, he&#8217;s arrogant and yet he&#8217;s adorable, funny and sweet. Throughout the story as we get to know him better, we discover that underneath that bad boy rocker exterior is a big-hearted, generous caring soul. Trip is amazing, and might now be my favorite member of Black Falcon. Then there&#8217;s Holly Pearson. Sweet, innocent, hard-working Holly has come home from college to try to help save her dad&#8217;s business. She is looking forward to spending a lot of time with her long-time boyfriend Jackson Cruze, but that is just not meant to be. Apparently fate has other plans and our two main characters begin their journey to find love and happiness.I enjoyed RTB a lot. Hotness and sexy banter aside (and yes there&#8217;s plenty), there are also issues of hate and intolerance as well as sadness and I found myself emotionally involved with the characters and their circumstances.  Both Holly&#8217;s father and Holly&#8217;s best friend Max have unresolved important issues they are dealing with and both realize going at it alone is not the answer. The author teaches us an important lesson about the value of trust in friends and family, and how being your strongest sometimes means asking for help when you really need it.I have to say the one flaw I found with this book is the ending. To me, it ended a bit too soon. I don&#8217;t mean because it was only 90% on my Kindle; I mean because I felt like Trip and Holly&#8217;s story wasn&#8217;t completely wrapped up. I&#8217;d like to know how they plan to make things work with their lifestyles. What&#8217;s going to happen when Trip goes back out on tour? Or will there not be another tour? Michelle Valentine I hope you can answer these questions soon, with another great book in the series.If you&#8217;re a fan of this series, I highly recommend you read Rock the Beat. If you&#8217;re new to Black Falcon, I suggest you start from the beginning with Book 1, so as not to be lost and confused by the other characters.

$review_text.: Nice clean romance, even though at times it dragged a little. Some themes were introduced in the storyline only to be dropped a little later without bringing anything to the story itself (e.g. I didn't understand the presence of Eliza and Aunt Mabel, and why the theme of Eliza's book was introduced at all when nothing came out of it in the end).I couldn't connect with the characters and couldn't feel the chemistry between them. Although the sparks are there when they meet again, their pushing and pulling got a little irritating at times, especially since at the end Sage seems to change her mind overnight, in spite of the past five years spent hating Dawson.I didn't particularly like Sage as a character, but I did like Dawson and his character growth.All in all it is a nice story, the plot had potential, but I felt it lacked a little more depth and character development.

$REVIEW.: There's a darn good reason--indeed lots of reasons--why Dan Poynter's manual has frequently been called the "bible of self-publishing." To the best of my knowledge, it was the first and certainly one of the very best ever published on this specialized aspect of book production

It covers the entire process from pre-pub requirements right through the mechanics of design, formatting and printing.Dan doesn't simply throw out generalities about what must be done in each phase of the project; he delves into the nitty-gritty simplifying this challenging effort for those of us tackling self-publishing for the first time


I know
I did it after I studied his book from cover to cover.Dan also includes a plethora of resources interspersed in the text as he illustrates each step

These can be most helpful to the uninitiated who are told what they must do in so many other books, but don't know where to go to accomplish each of those steps

At the simplest level, as an illustration, Dan doesn't just state that you have to procure an ISBN, he explains what it is and why it is needed and most important of all where to find it on the Bowker web site.There are three excellent books that I have used to brief myself on self-publishing before producing my latest book
In addition to Dan's Manual, I suggest reading Peter Bowerman's "The Well-Fed Self-Publisher" and Patricia L


Fry's excellent study of the subject.I attribute much of the success of the award-winning "The Writer Within You" to all three of them
I strongly suggest you start your effort with the outstanding guidance Dan has provided.

$REVIEW.: ....part two of The First Bird finds the reluctant linguist, Matt, his gun ho girlfriend Meagan,  and an unlikely pairing of a team put together by the CDC and a billionaire entrepreneur

With no other choice, the head of the CDC, (a tenacious but altruistic woman named Carla)  must let the money hungry entrepreneur, fund the trip to the Amazon aboard his jet; and using his seemingly limitless funds and connections to persuade the Brazilian government to give he and his team access to their jungle under the false pretense of a scientific expedition


When in truth the money hungry man just wants to exploit the fauna for a huge profit


Blinded by greed, he doesn't realize the investment for his prize may be more than he can pay!Matt solves the riddle of the ancient Incas (and other warnings in several different languages, some far older, some not even a true language at all, but all portend of dire peril for those foolish enough to enter) and though he tells them again and again of what he fears may be waiting, (visions of horrible creatures deep in the bowels of the earth, and roaming the frozen peaks of the dark mountains; terrors witnessed first hand making him more than ready to heed the signs) is ignored and ordered to lead the doomed team into a a lost valley created by a massive meteor strike hundreds of thousands-perhaps millions- of years ago
The animals, plants and insect life are all either poisonous, hostile, but mostly ....hungry! Giant spiders the great great ancestor of the trapdoor species are everywhere...only these are as big as a pony and could snatch an African rhinoceros and have it dragged into its burrow faster than a kid snatches a pop up eggo!  Now I'm not going to spoil it for you any further

I had no idea that I'd fall in love with these books. I think this was the first book that left me saying WTF and literally talking to myself. I was up late one night reading and no one was there to help me digest what I'd just read. The brilliant author makes you feel every emotion that these characters are having. AOP left me wanting more! Which we got more with Worthy of Redemption and Worth the Fight. I was happy that Luke finally got his own story. It wasn't over the top, it didn't drag on and left me completely content on how this story ended. These books suck me in and I couldn't put it Down. I highly recommend this book and this series.

His predictions of the future are well within the imagination of the common man. His Harkonite hero is man for all seasons. In his quest for justice, he draws on his abilities as well as his arsenal of aids and weapons to fulfill his mission.  The Meat Dolls are the Stepford Wives on steroids. The Meat Market and the men that run it must be dealt with. The story twists and turns, it left me encouraged to turn pages. Turning foes into friends and picking up few stragglers along the way our hero triumphs. John Harkon! Just one word for him &#8220;badass&#8221;!

$REVIEW.: So Another Enchanted April is about three friends who are all sort of stuck in their own ruts. Jerry is secretly in love with Doug, Doug is not so secretly in love with himself, and Tony is stuck in the kind of deep depression that comes from chronic pain and a broken body. The three decide to take a vacation in a small town at a stately B&B; with the world's most impressive garden (complete with terraces, hunky caretaker, magical enchantment, and a massive walk-in shower for parties.Arvin has a gift for rich scene description and it comes in handy here, because without it the stateliness of the gardens or the B&B; wouldn't be able to come to life for the reader. As the three men are drawn into the magic of the garden, interesting things begin to happen: Tony starts to get brave, and to believe that he might be worthy of love after all. Jerry grows a backbone, and manages to take off the rose-colored glasses through which he's been seeing his buddy. Doug manages NOT to get laid for a change, which causes him to do some deep thinking about himself (although he clings tenaciously to his self-absorbed partying ways). The emotional journey of each character is very relateable (if that's even a word).The supporting cast is fabulous as well, from the cook at the B&B; who all but gives Doug a beat-down for hitting on her son to the poor bodybuilder who (bless his heart) hasn't gotten laid in years because he passes out when he gets excited. Oh, yeah, and about the sex: this is a book full of hot and sweaty manlove - there is actually a lot of sweetness in the characters' intimate interactions. Still, there is still plenty of sizzle and heat, and I think the book is actually all the more enjoyable because a little is left to the imagination.I think I still liked Simple Men a little bit more, but it's so hard to beat chocolate muffins and attack squirrels, so the bar was set very high on that one.

$REVIEW.: I take lots of photos for reference use on making art quilts and had hoped that this book would go into more detail about the best way to take photos for creating a quilt based on the photo.  There is just a general description in the beginning and then most of the book is devoted to her quilt projects. Had she gone into sharing the use of various photo elements with her projects it would have been more interesting and helpful.  I did like sections in the back part of the book that covered different types of &#34;materials&#34; that would create interesting effects on the quilt.

$REVIEW.: I admit, every once in a while, I'll kiss a book. This was one of them. It's a feeling of kinship and gratitude beyond words. If you've ever felt like a 'radical' or been called 'fanatical' this book will give you inspiration to keep going. Mary Pipher encourages the reader to be bold giving her own examples of how she used to write sentences like, "Based on previous information, we could tentatively conclude for certain populations..."  That kind of writing changed to sentences like, "We live in a girl-poisoning culture."Having such clear examples will help any reader be more direct and honest in their writing.She quotes people like Adrienne Rich who said, "That which is unspoken becomes unspeakable." Lately I've become aware of unspeakable acts by humans. It makes me wonder if more of us had spoken up, could have we stopped the suffering? There are guiding quotes throughout - another one by Marion Dane Bauer who said, "Never think of revising as fixing something that is wrong. That starts you off in a negative frame of mind. Rather think of it as an opportunity to improve something you already love."It's a great reminder. What do you love?Mary Pipher helps the reader determine his or her point of view to set the stage for writing about their cause. Are you an intimate insider, an outsider or a connected critic?Do you want to encourage kindred spirits or change from one point of view to another?She has an easy to read style with just the right amount of personal stories. Mary writes... if the most important thing for restaurants is 'location, location, location; then what's needed for persuasion is 'connection, connection, connection.'

$review_text.: I have read the paperback about 3 times amd the hardback once. I loved it. Laurence Vance: The Other Side of Calvinism, is more scholarly than this, but this is aimed at a more popular audience.This is probably the most academic of Hunts books and it deliberately and exhaustively quotes many Clavinists themselves, so it cannot honestly be accused of missrepresentation.It's interesting that the views Hunt and I hold (biblicism) are still called Calvinism by 'actual' Arminians.Hunt gives a good History of the doctrine. Augustine from Montanism to Luther, Calvin and the church state synod of Dort. You cannot really seperate the doctrines of grace so called from the negative historical baggage.

$review_text.: Knowing that I have a huge soft spot for Kale, I was delighted to find that Immortal Heart is Kale's POV and ALL about him. Yay!! *bounces excitedly*Kale is searching for his reincarnated soulmate H&eacute;l&egrave;ne. Whilst looking for her , Kale befriends a police detective named Deacon. Deacon is no ordinary police detective, he is also a Chor like Kale. Deacon is a newly infected Chor and Kale helps Deacon to control his feeding and helps him adjust to his new lifestyle.Kale and Deacon begin investigating human trafficking, where the girls are being sold for their blood; so not your normal trafficking!! The two Chor wind up undercover at Jesper Shipping Yard as security guards. Where they meet Sola; their boss' daughter.Kale and Sola forge an intimate friendship, based on the lie that Kale is someone else. Eventually Kale admits that he cannot offer Sola anything but friendship because his heart belongs to another.Inger Iversen does a great job at building Kale's heartache and pain, and showing the things he has struggled with in his life both before and after he was infected.I loved reading about Kale, how he has been walking through life for more than a century after H&eacute;l&egrave;ne's death and still hasn't yet found the reincarnate of her; Ella. I've seen his anguish over the events of his past and how Kale tries to keep his past from those he cares about. Kale has tried to find his comeuppance for all the pain he's caused but there is no-one who could punish Kale anymore than he punishes himself.Immortal Heart is once again extremely well written and it sucked me in right from the start. Immortal Heart flows seamlessly into book #1, Few Are Angels picks up where this leaves off. If you read Immortal Heart before Few Are Angels you wouldn't know that it was written after books #1 and #2.I really do love this series and I cannot wait for the next instalment.

$review_text.: Good book. Plenty of action, suspense, real world scenarios- not all feel-good 'fluff'. I like my books like I like my movies- funny and/or packed with action. This is a Christian book but it is not preachy or smothered in it. I appreciated how it shows a person who is dependent on only themselves find the need to reach out to someone else for help- and often that 'someone' is God.I found the characters to be well developed; the various settings were descriptive (it takes place in Florida). There was only one spot where I found myself simply skimming it because I was slightly bored with the scenario and that was only two pages.Having limited experience with the police department- other than two brother-in-laws in the police force, one retired- I cannot really say whether this aspect of the book was accurate or not. My interaction with my in-law police officers is quite opposite of the image I get from this book. Often I see the same portrayal of officers in movies that Mynheir gives in this book. If you are in law enforcement or close to those in the field, I'm sure you'll be able to pick apart these portions of the book.I was going to include the main characters but the minor characters get so intertwined in the story that the list would be too long. Parts of the book focus more on one minor character, then other parts focus on another.I received this book from WaterBrook Multnomah in exchange for an honest review.

$review_text.: From the outset, I read everything I can by Bettina Aptheker.  Aptheker's (1989) book Tapestries of Life discussion of dailiness had a powerful influence on my dissertation research and gave me a language from which to see.  So I was eager to read her autobiography.  This is not a Pollyanna life is wonderful memoir.  What is to come is foreshadowed in the prologue when Aptheker noted, "With disclosure, cycles of violence may be stopped. . . . I was a "reliable witness" to my own life. . . . bearing witness is a political and spiritual practice in which the participants go to a place of great suffering and publicly acknowledge its existence" (pp. 5,6).Family dynamics, incest from 3 to 13, political activism, to the inner workings of a child trying to understand and make sense of her world and the adjustments are made in relation to her context.  This is a rich reliving and telling of Aptheker's growth into a woman.  As I read about the early years, I was transported to that time, forgetting that she was writing in retrospect, I easily thought I was listening to a child describe how she coped(?) and adjusted to survive the abuse, family dynamics and circumstances.The other part of the story is her family's and her activism and how their beliefs and values shaped the woman she is.  McCarthyism, the Communist Life in America.  We get a rich glimpse into a part of US history and the years that followed and how Aptheker's views and ideas were influenced by her context.This is a tremendous, tremendous autobiography.Aptheker, B. (1989). Tapestries of life: Women's work, women's consciousness, and the meaning of daily experience. Amherst, MA: University of Massachusetts Press.

$REVIEW.: The Other Brother by Lucy FelthouseThis is the Mr. June story in the Calendar Men series.Looks like I may have to get the rest of the stories after reading this one. Yummy!Melodie has had a rough past couple of years due to loosing her fianc&eacute; in the war. She has moved away from her family and friends so she really doesn&#8217;t have anyone to lean on. Then one day out of the blue she gets a surprise visitor. Patrick is the brother of her fianc&eacute; that she hasn&#8217;t seen since the funeral. What she didn&#8217;t expect was the hunk of meat standing in her doorway while she looked like what a cat would drag in. She feels bad that she finds him so attractive so she does everything she can to try to push him away. Do you think she will actually be successful or will she succumb to his piercing green eyes? I received this book as a gift from the author.

$review_text.: This book had me in knots.  It's about self healing, self discovery and finding you true love.  Fate.  I received in exchange  for a honest review....loved it!This is Miranda and Troy's story coming to life eight years after they were ripped from each other under circumstances neither could understand at age eleven.Miranda is damaged and has secrets, but she leaves Seattle to start over at college in Texas.  Her escape is piano and she is talented.  She wins a scholarship and is set to live life totally different and be a normal college girl or at least she hopes too.  Her first day of class starts and in walks the man of her dreams...he's beautiful, shaggy blond hair, green eyes and a laugh like no other.  He and his friend take their seats right in front of her and her friend and she can't believe it....it can't be....it's Troy her best friend who she hasn't seen in eight years.Troy is the gorgeous, funny, sweet, quarterback  that seems like he might be too good to be true.  He sees Miranda for the first time in eight years and is just shocked.  She is the first girl he ever loved, wanted and was his best friend.  This is their chance, it's like destiny.  He's ready to jump in and make up for missed time, but Miranda is hesitant.As the book goes on you see turmoil in Miranda as she struggles with how to tell Troy her secrets.  She knows that when they come out he won't want to be with her anymore, she's damaged.Once the secrets are out there, I was shocked a little.  Not what I was expecting...wow!  The journey Miranda takes to find herself and allow those secrets to surface, that took strength on her part.  It's not how you look to everyone else, it's how you look too yourself both inside and out!This book had me wanting to go back and experience college again.  I met my husband our freshmen year of college and it brought back all those memories!  I cried, laughed, fell in love with the characters and was shocked.  I would love to read more about Troy and Miranda.  The writing flows nicely and there is depth to all the characters.  Sydney Aaliyah Michelle does a fantastic job and this will not be my last book of hers.  Read it and enjoy a great romance novel about second chances and I believe fate!

$review_text.: It is several years since Greg Iles published his last book because he has been recovering from a near fatal auto accident. It is a credit to Greg that not only has he started writing again but his writing doesn't seem to have been affected by that trauma. Most of us who were followers of Greg Iles will have dimmed memories of his last books featuring Penn Cage, and this novella is a great way to revisit a character that we previously knew so well. In a clever and useful novella Iles manages to revisit the life and adventures of Penn Cage and introduce us to his next book.In a discussion with his uncle while they are waiting for news of the recovery of Cage's father Tom from a heart attack, Iles paints a vivid picture of Natchez and outlines some of Penn's former life from his time in the District Attorney's office in Houston to more recently as Mayor of Natchez when he smashed an international crime ring using a riverboat gambling casino based in Natchez for their nefarious activities (featured in his last bookThe Devil's Punchbowl: A Novel).The novella also introduces a scenario of possible assisted death that is central to his next book "Natchez Burning" as Penn recounts the painful death of his wife Sarah and how Penn's father, Tom Cage, a respected doctor, helped her cope with a painful death by cancer with carefully administered medications.This was a good novella - 4.5 stars. Now I am well primed to move on and readNatchez Burning (Penn Cage).

$REVIEW.: Married to Maggie is a great romance story! When super rich Ty accidentally meets Maggie in an airport, he thinks he's found the potential bride he needs to convince his grandfather that he's responsible enough to take over the family's oil business

However, the meeting isn't an accident and Ty and Maggie find out that there is a lot more behind their meeting than they first thought.This book is full of drama, passion and romance
Ty, despite his highly privileged upbringing, is a wonderful, sexy hero, while the heroine is smart and feisty enough to stand her ground in the cut-throat world of the Dallas mega wealthy
 I loved the two main characters so much that I couldn't stop reading to find out what would happen to them.Married to Maggie is a great romance read that will have you turning the pages until the early hours of the morning! I can't wait to read more in this series.

$review_text.: Marie's Tempting Reads ARC Review:I sure will miss the adventures of Sera and Cole. This is one series that left me VERY satisfied and just wishing it could go on and on. I LOVED the romance between Cole and Sera and the surprises in each new book kept me enthralled to the very last page.In My Demon's Destiny Volume Three, we get to start things pretty much where everything left off in the second book, and right away, trouble immediately finds Cole and Sera. I love the protectiveness both Sera and Cole have for each other. Their love is obvious and there for all to see and they have no problem dealing with each others enemies to keep each other safe and sound.We get to meet Cole's family in this as well as finally understand the full impact that is Cole. I have always found myself immensely intrigued with Cole as well as find him  incredibly sexy and downright possessive of his angel, Sera.Sera is one angel you don't want to mess with, especially when your messing with HER demon. I love the powers she possess and the fact that she tries not use them unless their in some dire circumstance.Oh my, this story kept me up and biting my fingernails until the very last word on the very last page. I am amazed with the writing and quite happy with how things began and ended with My Demon's Destiny Volume 3.I give this romance, a FULL FIVE OUT OF FIVE STARS! Its intense, addicting, sexy, and just plain GOOD. I sincerely hope to see more work from Alicia Nikita and Dawn Jakz. I really believe that this Series is a W-I-N-N-E-R.

$REVIEW.: It is appropriate that an important contribution to occult literature is to be found in a slim volume with an unassuming and quirky title.The author presents sufficient theory and practice that will allow even a neophyte to access in a reasonably safe and suprisingly convenient manner the astral realms. Quite an accomplishment.  But this is by no means only a book for beginners. Advanced practitioners (assuming they have an open mind) will find a great deal to ponder and benefit from in this volume. Anyone serious about magickal practice or even just magickal theory should acquire this book and consider its contents carefully. They will be well repaid for their efforts.Aleister Crowley was the baddest of bad boys. He made great advancements in the magickal realm while sending shock waves through the clubby and largely ineffectual grade system of traditional occult fraternities, It is no small irony that the magickal orders that profess to be Thelemic are as full of pretentious poseurs as those that Crowley blasted with his extraordinary talent and application. I suspect that his book will not be well liked by those in authority in Crowleyian magickal orders. The author reveals too many secrets for comfort. I believe Crowley would have approved of this book that captures the spirit of authentic Thelemic magickal theory and practice.

Having read book one made it easier to follow andunderstand these references. Rating this book is so simple--5 stars onevery element. I was so impressed . What a fun and interesting storyline.It was such a smooth easy read. No grammatical errors-great editing. Thecharacters were so good and enjoyable. Great continuation on returningcharacters from book one.  The dialogue between the characters was so wellwritten. The interaction held your attention and you just had to keepreading. There is a Hott scene in a bedroom that I feel was so wellwritten. It was more than just another Hott scene. It just reached out andgrabbed me. Even had me laughing.

$REVIEW.: The Great Wall of China is the most impressive defensive system the world has ever seen.  The Great Wall of China is not a single fortress line but a series of walls that span over 6,000 kilometers.  The construction of these walls span from 221 BC to 1644.  Obviously, any book that wants to cover the Great Wall has a lot of great history to cover.Osprey Publishing has a stable of military writers they can turn to when they need a book cranked out.  Stephen Turnbull is their Japan expert.  I guess this qualifies him to write a book on the Great Wall.  Turnbull has read most of the modern English language sources and has taken a vacation to China.  He has taken all that information and boiled it down to fit into Osprey's 64 page format.  Turnbull is a competent writer and it is an easy book to read. Unfortunately, I got the sense that Turnbull is just going through the paces and the genuine enthusiasm he brings to his Japanese books is missing in this volume.The Great Wall of China is one of those pleasant volumes that are best purchased used.  There is nothing wrong with the book but I am not sure that it was worth $16.95 for a glorified master's thesis.  I have an appetite to learn more about the Great Wall and I am going to have to look elsewhere to have that thirst quenched.

$REVIEW.: The main protagonist, Clara, used to work as a servant at Gravesend, whilst her mother was the housekeeper. There is a long curse on Gravesend so that anyone who lives there will lose what they love most. Just under 17 years old, Clara falls for Lord Telford&#8217;s youngest son, Richard, and their secret rendezvous, convinces her that he is just as much in love. Once the Lady of the house hears about their closeness she dismisses Clara of her duties and Clara is forced to leave Gravesend. A short while later, Richard dies and so the Gravesend curse causes Clara to lose what she loves most.Many years later, Clara is approached by Richard&#8217;s twin brother, Atticus, who makes Clara an offer of marriage. But this isn&#8217;t a normal proposal because Atticus&#8217;s father is dying and to make his last days happier, Atticus decides to get married. Clara has never liked Atticus, mainly because Richard didn't like him when they were in love, and as a result, Clara is very suspicious about his true motives. To Clara, Richard is the hero, and Atticus is the evil brother, but we soon learn that not is all as it seems.The arrangement between the two is more like a business arrangement because once Lord Telford dies, Clara is free to leave and Atticus promises that she will be provided for so that she wont need to work.When Atticus approaches Clara for marriage, I had a feeling that Clara would fall in love with him but I wasn&#8217;t sure if he would like her in return but Atticus, it seems, was in love with Clara from her time as a servant.Clara&#8217;s time as Atticus&#8217; wife was fun to read, mainly because she used to be the servant of the house she becomes the head of. Her witty remarks and her easy banter made this book an easy read. There were many surprises, plenty of misunderstandings and for a while I feared that the curse would get Clara twice, but for once, we have a nice happy ending.Favourite Quotes:&#8220;My Clara,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I shall miss you.&#8221; A quick, fierce embrace, and she whispered, &#8220;Be better than you have been, and be safe.&#8221;I dropped my gaze to my cup and saucer as I fought for control over my emotions, and he said, &#8220;I discovered some time ago that if I couldn&#8217;t laugh at myself, every burden that life handed me would be all the heavier.&#8221;Lukewarm water brought for washing. Mail &#8220;forgotten.&#8221; Gowns singed by the iron... no, that I had never done. Surly and rebellious though I had been at times, I would not have harmed an innocent garment- not unless it had first committed the cardinal sin of being ugly.&#8220;But no one is safe from regret at any point in life. One may regret ordering lamb for dinner instead of mutton. All of life is a succession of risks, and each of us must judge for ourselves which risks are worth the taking.&#8221;&#8220;Lord Telford,&#8221; I began, &#8220;I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll understand that to request to see such an intimate exchange-&#8220;&#8220;Good God, woman, I&#8217;ve not asked you to strip naked. A kiss is nothing. Why, you kissed me on only the second time we met.&#8221;I liked her more at that moment than at any time since meeting her. &#8220;My parents, rest their souls, were English.&#8221;&#8220;Oh they were, were they? And just what do you know about them? Were they married? To each other?&#8221;

$review_text.: I was a huge fan of Robert McCammon's work growing up. Not just his horror fiction either. I loved Boy's Life and Gone South as much, if not more, than his fantastic horror novels like Swan Song and They Thirst.  So it pains me a little bit to admit that The Five was a somewhat of a letdown. I wasn't disappointed because I was expecting the book to contain horror or supernatural elements, far from it.  I was mostly disappointed because the characters and situations in The Five were less believable and realistic than even those in his most outlandish stories.  I know a bit about the underground music scene, and most of the genres of music McCammon talks about in The Five don't even exist. It just seemed very contrived. And the descriptions of the crowds at the gigs, especially at Stone Church, were especially ridiculous and unbelievable. Sorry, people just don't act like that, even music fans, who he is painting with a broad brush because apparently he hasn't been around many of those types of folks.  As for the band members, there didn't seem to be any chemistry, and I don't see a group of people so radically different from one another getting together to form a band. McCammon chose a few stereotypical musician types from different genres, mixed them together, and expected us to believe that such a band would really exist. It just didn't work for me.I also think he glossed over the character of Jeremy Pett, the Marine sniper. Having served in the Marines in the nineties, I've observed that Marines in novels and in movies are almost never portrayed as real people who happened to join the Marines, but are usually cardboard cutouts who act in cliched ways. Nearly all Marines are real unique people first and foremost with radically different personalities from one another.  Of course, the same could be said of service members from any branch.  But what we have in The Five is apparently a person who talks and acts in a stereotypical manner and it just wasn't believable for me at all.Even though McCammon lost some credibility in my eyes with his characters, he still has a nice elegant writing style that moves the story right along, and for that reason The Five still succeeds on some level.  It's just that I expected so much more.  If you've already read his older classics and are wanting some new McCammon then The Five might be worth picking up. But if you're new to McCammon I would recommend his earlier works, especially The Wolf's Hour, Gone South, Boy's Life and Swan Song, as they tower over The Five in every respect.

$review_text.: The exploits of Carlos Hathcock, the Marines' most famous sniper, are well known by most readers of military non-fiction.  Charles Henderson's Marine Sniper: 93 Confirmed Kills was a bestseller and a great read.  Whitefeather, however, gives a more intimate, complete, and informed look at Hathcock.Whitefeather was written by Norman and Roy Chandler, who were not only personal friends of Hathcock, but extremely knowledgeable regarding sniping, as evidenced by their spectacular Death From Afar series.  The result is a book that no other authors could have produced.Anyone who is interested in Marine Corps sniping, rifles, vietnam, or general military history should not be without this book.  It would be a classic if it were better known and less expensive, but rest assured, it's worth every penny you pay.

But I'd say you're crazy.Thoughts: There don't seem to be many writing books dedicated to the specific techniques of genre. The book is split in two parts. The first half is mystery, and the second half is suspense. The author does a good job of explaining how the techniques used can often be very different. The suspense half of the book is just plain old Good Storytelling, and the tricks explained in that section would work for almost any story. Who doesn't want a suspensful story?Summary: I wish more books on storytelling were like this. Just buy it.

$REVIEW.: It's usually not popular for leaders to make demands of their followers, but Jesus made many demands of his disciples. John Piper, author of the bestselling Don't Waste Your Life and When I Don't Desire God, believes that the teachings of Jesus are filled with demands that show not only who Jesus is but what He expects from us.Piper is intentional in the use of his word "demands." He explains:"I am aware the word `demand' is jarring to many modern ears. It feels harsh, severe, strict, stark, austere, abrasive. The reason I choose that word is to confront some of the underlying reasons for why it would feel offensive to portray Jesus as demanding."In this 400-page book, Piper explores 50 demands of Jesus. They cover a wide variety of topics beginning with "You must be born again" and concluding with "Make disciples of all nations, for the mission cannot fail." In between, readers find the demands of "Abide in me," "Strive to enter through the narrow door, for all of life is war," and "Do this in remembrance of me, for I will build my church."Often a given demand will be divided into two and even three or more chapters that explore different facets of the main idea. For example, "Do not be angry" is examined from two angles: trust God's providence and embrace mercy and forgiveness. The result is a thorough examination of each demand.In the chapter "Take Up Your Cross and Follow Me," Piper writes:"He did not die to make this life easy for us or prosperous. He died to remove every obstacle to our everlasting joy in making much of him. And he calls us to follow him in his suffering because this life of joyful suffering for Jesus's sake shows that he is more valuable than all the earthly rewards that the world lives for. If you follow Jesus only because he makes life easy now, it will look to the world as though you really love what they love, and Jesus just happens to provide it for you. But if you suffer with Jesus in the pathway of love because he is your supreme treasure, then it will be apparent to the world that your heart is set on a different fortune than theirs."These kinds of rich nuggets of wisdom and insight line the pages of What Jesus Demands FROM the World. The result is a deeply impactful book that will challenge readers to reflect not only on what they know about Jesus but what they have yet to discover. Piper actually designed the book so that it doesn't need to be read in order. Chapters can be enjoyed and savored at the reader's discretion, making it a deep devotional read or book for personal study.If you're a fan of John Piper or Desiring God Ministries, you won't want to miss this book.--- Reviewed by Margaret Oines

$review_text.: Well this was written when this book was Midnight Tides, though it appears to have morphed into the german version of House of Chains


 Go figure.With the exception of Trull Sengar, introduced briefly in the House of Chains, this novel does not include characters from previous novels, and in fact is set in a completely different land from the previous 4 novels


 While it follows the stories of several characters, all are involved in the same central conflict, though from different locations and perspectives

 This is a departure from his previous writing style, where 2 or more completely divergent plots were developed concurrently in differing locations.The story involves the backstory of Trull, who was banished at the beginning of book 4 from the Tiste Edur


 There is a notable military campaign in the last half of the novel, substantial political involvement both in the human and tiste edur camps, and some humor in the form of the dialogue of Tehol as well as the rat catcher's guild which I found very tedious


 Half a star was removed for this reason.This is a great novel, and despite weighing in at 900+ pages (paperback) it still seemed too short.This (as well as book 6) is available now on the amazon.ca (canada) site, though the hardback of book 5 is coming in the US soon.

$REVIEW.: It reminded me of the movie "Alien", not because of the plot itself, but the setting and the pace. It's a well worth sci-fi thriller option with good pace that doesn't delve into useless and excessive description, sub-plots and character development.I must emphasize I value an author that can tell an engaging story in no much more than 250 pages and William Massa did a great job in this book, enough for me to buy some others by him (the next I'm going to read is "Silicon Man").There are some inconsistencies but not enough to hinder the enjoyment (after all, it is science fiction) and the ending, even letting some questions unanswered, is satisfying (to avoid spoilers, I'll add a comment about these minor flaws).

$REVIEW.: I postponed reading this book as the author's tales told in the Kinsella universe kept calling to me; perhaps, inadvertently, I saved the best 'til last.I was already in awe of Gina Marie's ability to craft 'cutting edge' science fiction that didn't strike me, a reasonably informed layman, as technically implausible


 Certainly, it seemed she had a far better grasp of physics than did I


 And she wrapped all this neat scientific speculation with gripping stories about interesting people!With, &#34;The Far Side,&#34; Ms


Wylie continues with cutting edge science, asking: &#34;what if the 'many worlds' hypothesis is true?&#34;  She then crafts a marvellously gripping story about curiously competent and interesting people, throws in enough history to intrigue S.C.A


buffs, demonstrates a knowledge of economic fundamentals rarely taught in school, then tosses in enough political -- speculation -- to warm any good libertarian's heart.Although I've read a lot of 'military science fiction' over the years and spent my 4 as an electronics tech in the U.S
Air Force, I feel unqualified to comment on her understanding of, &#34;special ops,&#34; and military science generally beyond, &#34;Seemed good to me.&#34;One of the two major characters, swears

 A lot

 She drops the F bomb, often

 If you find swearing distasteful, I urge you to get over it and read this story anyway
 One of the themes in this book involves the unreliability of first impressions
:)Though there were a few uncaught typos here and there (a 'then' instead of 'than' for instance), I did not note many nor were they ever so consistent that I suspected the author to be unaware of correct usage.She could have turned this one book into a series and I almost wish she had

 Everyone of her sub-plots and many of her characters could have carried a full novel
 I suppose she may do so yet; but whether she does or not, I fully expect to purchase (and enjoy) all her future offerings.G.

$REVIEW.: The author Deborah Price is a money coach, yet her approach to finances is similiar to that of therapist.  She has great insight into the minds of people and how they think. How people think affects their relationship to money.  Most of us harbor negative feelings towards money. Many harbor the attitude that money is dirty or that it is the root of all of today's problems. If someone is wealthy they run the risk of being labeled as greedy or dishonest.  We all carry around within us some anxiety when it comes to money. Living in constant anxiety of not having enough we try to control or money and get as much of it as we can. Those who are wealthy do not find themselves immune to worries. Many try to protect their money from those who would take it and there is pressure to invest it wisely.  Whether we like it or not money is a living force and it is time  we woke up to that fact. How much money we have, material goods we aquire and our job define who we are and our self worth.  People wear themselves out trying to obtain material goods they do not and want only because society tells them they want it. It is high to confront this attitude and change it. Our self worth should be measured in terms of gifts and abilities. Many folks assess their worth in terms of assets and saving.  The author has a new way that involves internal gifts, accomplishments and actual hour spent achieving goals. Money is not the bottom line.Our relationship to money is largely determined by our personal history with money and our collective history with money.  Our personal history  relates more to our upbringing and our parents relationship with money. Whether one likes to realize it or not we inherit our attitudes about money from our parents. There is also a collective history humanity has with money. Around the time of the Greeks a nation.called the Lydians started using something called money which took the place of bartering. The Greeks used it and it extended their influence. The Romans also made use of money. Money became a living force with which wars were fought over. It was these wars that formulated our negative attitude towards money. We have made money a God and we have surrendered all our power to the almighty dollar.The book gives over  8 archetypes in dealing with money. The ultimate is the money magician.  The first archetype  is the innocent. The innocent has no knowledge of money and their way of dealing with things is to let other people make theif decisions for them. 2) The victim feels they have been screwed over by the world or someone and they tend to be rather resentful.  3) The martyr feels that they have given of themselves greatly and they want be compensated.  4) The warrior type sets out to conquer money. They  tend to be real competitive and view competitors as foes. They also like to handle all the finances. 5) The fool type tends to be rather restless and undisciplined.  The fool is very adventurous and confident. The fool lives for the day. 6) The creator artist type tends to be rather detached and not really into material items. They can be loners and enjoy spirituality.  7) The tyrant is very controlling, rigid and manipulative. They use money to control other people. 8) Last there is the magician who is energetic,  balanced  and darn good with money.How does one become a magician?  The answer is spiritual. One must pray to God and have faith. The magician does their best to follow their destiny.  As they say let go and let God.Over all great book. The author prompts the reader to examine his or her issues and how they pertain to money.  The stories in the book  serve to illustrate the lessons that the author is trying to teach. The exercises at the end of the chapter help the reader with personal growth. My favorite was the 60 day prosperity plan.Here is the plan1) make a gratitude list2) create a wish list3) Create a sacred altar that pertains to what you wish to manifest4) Spend a few minutes before your altar meditating praying,reading your lists and lighting a candle to connect with spirit.5) Keep track of your negative thoughts. Right them down and then say (This belief does not suit my purposes I will not house this thought in my head any longer.6) Avoid people with negative money attitudes and behaviors.7) Keep a 100 dollar bill in your wallets to reinforce prosperous thinking.8) practice generousity.9) choose  a sacred witness to observe your actions and discuss your progress with.10) surrender your fears in writing to God.11) Look in the mirror and remind yourself there is more than what is seen on the surface.

$review_text.: Falling For Her Fiance was just an all around fun romance.  Dani and Wes are great together.  I have always been the person who roots for the best friends to fall in love.  With this story, you get two best friends who decide to be pretend fiances for big events they have coming up.  What they don't realize, is that this crazy love is going to sneak up on them both and bash them over the heads.I really loved both Dani and Wes.  They are fun, athletic and energetic.  They make sure to be adventurous and always have a good time together.  They are there for each other, no matter what.  While Dani can be a little more serious, and Wes a little more impulsive, they bring out the best in each other.  I think that is what everyone is looking for.I could not help but to root for Dani and Wes to get together!  Since we are reading from both of their perspectives, there were times that I just wanted to scream at them both "You love each other you idiots, get on with it already!!"  Of course, I understood that they couldn't read each others minds, and had legitimate fears of ruining their friendship.  You can't blame a girl for wanting a little kissing action though!!Falling For Her Fiance was a delightful couple hours that had me laughing and smiling all the way through.  If you like romances that are fun (I know, I've said that word so many times in this review, but you should get the point by now, right?!?!) and engaging, this one is for you!

$REVIEW.: "Starting at the Finish Line; The Gospel of Grace for Mormons" is the story of Dr. John Wallace's exit from the Church of Latter-day Saints (Mormons). He opens his book by providing unique insight into his childhood/early adult years in the church and the subsequent struggle to satisfy the requirements of the church. This struggle left him feeling empty and, at times, hypocritical. Wallace experienced a crisis of faith as became unsettled with the reality of God's grace. In the second section of his book, he defends the accuracy and reliability of the Bible. This is crucial because the Mormon Church, as Wallace sees, is guilty of picking and choosing the parts of the Bible they will believe while at the same time dismiss it altogether. Wallace builds a solid defense of the Bible's reliability.In the third section, Wallace gives his readers a look into his crisis of faith as he came to terms with God's holiness and the Mormon tenant that man has the capacity to become a god. This crisis served as the catalyst for his exit. Sections four and five consist of Wallace's demonstration of the difference between Christianity and Mormonism in the areas of the person of Jesus Christ, the sufficiency of the blood atonement, grace, the balance between faith and works, and eternity. The latter sections are given to reconciling an existing tension between Christians and Mormons. That tension: Mormons believe there has to be something more than faith and Christians believe there can be nothing but faith."Starting at the Finish Line" is a good work.  When it comes to leading someone out of a false belief system, the most effective means in doing so is the testimony of one who belonged to that belief system. Wallace takes a fair and balanced approach in his writing. This is not a Mormon-bashing book. Wallace puts Mormon theology and the words of their leadership alongside the Bible and asks the reader to decide. This is a great book for the Mormon who is struggling within their belief system. This is also a great book for Christians to be able to understand the basic beliefs of the LDS Church and how to defend the tenants of the Christian faith.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from CrossFocused Reviews as part of their Blogger Review Program.

$REVIEW.: My first Sargent book.  I was attracted due to the WW2 angle and the fact it started on Bainbridge Island, one of my favorite places on the planet.  I found it interesting and the first novel I have read concerning the Japanese internment camps.  He brings to life the citizens who were forced on short notice to take along one bag of clothes for a trip of indeterminate length. The reason I only give it 4 stars is because I do not believe it was possible for a Nisei to serve on a Pacific Theatre Navy ship during that time.  Living in Central California, we are very familiar with the famed 442 and their exploits in Europe, but not the Navy.  I will need to do more research on that.  A thoroughly enjoyable read.  I now look forward to catching up on more Sargent books.

Not only do they cut you off from your family, but in isn't difficult to make the students realize they have no choice but to stay put. In Volume 2 of Nick Spencer's Morning Glories, the six new students all have a story to tell.Everyone has a story, but how important are those stories in relation to the person you have become? For the newest Morning Glories, those back stories directly tie to how they got there, and who they are going to become. If you are a little rich kid who committed an unspeakable act, is there a chance you can find your way out of it, or are you going to have to face your actions in the harshest way possible. When twin brothers are separated, can they ever come together and be the same? When a little girl is taken from her people, will her extraordinary talent lead who she is to become?The second volume of The Morning Glories wasn't much different from the first. The story was filled with mystery and intrigue, but I'll be darned if I am not still totally in the dark about what they heck is happening! I expected a few more answers than I got, so the story was a little frustrating when all it did was give me more questions. Still, the mystery continues to be interesting, so I will continue to keep reading, but I want answers people! I have NO idea what is happening!

 Stanley is WAY past his sell-buy date


 Rosie is almost tolerable in this book, which indicates how far the series has dropped in my regard.And then there's Mary--a 30-something woman with an Internet connection and a strong relationship with her mother, asking Rosie questions about sex that would have the average 14-year-old rolling her eyes and snickering at her naivete

 AND she's too dimwitted to even understand what Rosie's talking about--geez, Louise.This book doesn't even have a decent mystery
 The &#34;twist&#34; after the trial could be seen coming a mile away

 The whole thing with Clarissa, ditto


 (And talk about bad mothers--Becca takes the award, hands down.)


The whole book seemed like a contest between the characters for who would get the award for dumbest, most cloying, most annoying individual

 (Clarissa gets a pass, because she was only eight, and did her best with the situation her stupid mother got her into.)The only redeeming feature is that Mike's back

 Hopefully, he'll be able to salvage the next book

 (Why do I keep reading these if I'm so disappointed, you ask?  Because, like a dummy, I bought them all based on the strength of the first one, more fool I.)Oh, and she really needs to get a better proofreader than her husband

 Someone who understands the use of commas would be nice.I heartily recommend the first two books in this series--after that, proceed at your own risk!

$review_text.: It has been a great many years since I was a child, and yet, I find I have never outgrown my love for a good Cinderella story. It entrances me as much, if not more, than it ever did. I love and laud authors like Debra Brown who weave history, drama, and mystery around a sweet romance. Too many rely on pornographic scenes to supplant those elements. I really loved this book and hope to read more by this author. If you enjoy an extremely clever and well-written romance sprinkled with the language of Regency England, then you will love this book. By the way, the ending will surprise you!

$review_text.: Connected by the Sea is the first installment in the Hawaiian Crush series. This author was a first time read for me as well. This is a sweet contemporary romance about Sydney who is working towards a degree in Marine Biology. Her best friend is in love with her and she is falling for the bad boy.Henry loves her and feels like he'll always be in the friendzone. That he'll never be more to her.Coen is the bad boy of the school and is attracted to Sydney. They begin a relationship together but Coen gets tired of being hidden in the shadows.Sydney is conflicted because she is torn between not hurting Henry's feelings and following her heart. She knows that her decision could be the end of her friendship with Henry.This story fell short for me. The dialogue was choppy and didn't flow. There was a disconnect for me between characters as well. The sex scenes felt forced instead of there being a chemistry between the characters.I would have liked to see more of Sydney's emotions as she struggled between a tough decision. Overall, I gave this story two stars because it fell short for me.I received this book as an ARC from the author in exchange for an honest review.

$review_text.: My husband and I did the "sleep lady shuffle" with our daughter when she was 6 months old


 She was sleeping through the night within a week or two and has been ever since (she is 13 months now)
 The method didn't work as quickly for naptime, but it got us into a specific routine and after a few months of doing the same thing my daughter now falls asleep easily and takes two 2-hour naps each day - YAY!  I can't stress enough how important it is to have everyone involved w/ sleeptime read the pertinent chapters so every knows how to handle the sleep training

 Without my husband and I on the same page it would have been MUCH more difficult.

$REVIEW.: I received a free copy of the book from the author for my honest opinion.Genevieve is a young girl who lived in the 14th century and was dealt a very hard life. She reminded me of the little girl that Shirley Temple played in that movie The Little Princess or her life did. Genevieve lived with this couple who had an inn type place that they ran. She had to get up early in the morning and help in the kitchen and then she had to help make the beds. She was working from daylight till dark. But then she got lucky when a couple of nuns stopped at the inn one night and decided to take her back with them to live at the abbey. With everything she had been through Genevieve decide that she was never going to have anything to do with men ever and the nuns at the abbey had been so good to her over the years that she wanted to be a nun herself. She was very happy as nun for a very long time until a new priest came to town. Genevieve and the priest fell in love with each other but they were not allowed to show or let anyone know how they felt about each because they had made their vows. But after a while and with all the bad things that was going on at the abbey they decided that the best thing for them to do was leave, sneak off in the middle of the night.Anne a young woman who lived in the present day and time had broken up with the man that she loved a while back. But then one day he shows up on her door step sort of speaking. Anne still being in love with him no matter what had happened between them realized that she couldn't be without him and let him talk her into giving him another chance. So Anne and Neil go on a vacation. They get lost on the way to their hotel and spend the night in the mountains. They find an old abbey that has all but fell completely down. While they are at this old abbey Anne starts having these vision or dreams about this young girl. Anne feels or just knows somehow that vision was real. Anne wants to help this girl/ghost to move on so that she can be happy. Anne finds some old bones in an old oak tree and sets out to find out whose bones they are.Shadows of the Past tells of two young girls who live in two different time periods whose lives eventually end up joining. I like to read stories where you get more than one person's point of view especially with the past and the future collide with each other in some way or another. If you have not read Shadows of the Past and you enjoy reading historical romance with a little suspense thrown in then you are going to love Shadows of the Past. If you like Shirley Temple then you will love Genevieve as well. Hey give it a try who knows you just might like it I did. But of course I love Shirley Temple too.
$SUMMARY.: Shadows of the Past has a little suspense where the past and the future collide. A must read!

$REVIEW.: I was not compensated in any way for reading or reviewing this book.Coral Sinclair is a 25-year-old woman in 1970 on an adventure of discovery. Taken from Kenya as a small child by her mother, leaving her father behind, Coral has been somewhat sheltered in European culture. After the startling discovery of her high-profile fianc&eacute;'s unfaithfulness, the news of her father's death and subsequent inheritance in Kenya reaches her. Needing to escape heart break, and having longed to return to her home in Kenya for many years, she sets sail for Africa. After meeting a mysterious man upon her voyage, who comforts her in a moment of weakness and sorrow, she arrives at Mpingo. Happily reunited with her childhood nanny and fond memories of the past, she also faces a step-mother she was unaware of and questions regarding the circumstances of father's life and death. Upon learning that her mystery man from the ship, Rafe de Monfort, has connections to her father she must decide if she can trust herself and the feelings that Rafe brings out in her or listen to the warnings of those around her.Hannah Fielding's writing was gentle, poetic, and magical in her descriptions of the setting of this novel. As a reader, you can could close your eyes and picture the African plains cascading around you, hear the sounds of the animals, and almost smell the sand and the sea. Her main characters, Coral and Rafe, were strongly written and captivating. Coral is an inexperienced young woman who acts very childish at times. Rafe is a tarnished, guilt-ridden man who has learned to put forth a facade to shelter his true self. The transformation that occurs as you see both of these characters overcome their own insecurities and grow throughout the story is realistic and well depicted.Overall, I give this book a strong 4 stars. The beginning was a little slow for me, but by the end I could not put it down. Though many of the secondary characters have depth and complement the story, there were times I didn't quite &#34;feel&#34; the character, almost as if I needed more background on them. However, the love story between Coral and Rafe was so enticing and frustrating that there were times I truly wish I could reach in the book and slap one of them for their stupidity. The author explored the budding new relationship complete with baggage, meddling outsiders, and a touch of innocence. I would surely recommend this book to anyone looking for an engrossing read with a realistic love story that manages to be sensual without resorting to overly-explicit and obvious descriptions.

$review_text.: 4 stars for me and here's why. I think it has the components of a great story but there were a few holes in the plot and it took me out of the story a little but not enough for me to hate it. I wish that certain details were explored a little more, sometimes a novella isn't enough time to get a full story out. This story seems much larger than it's intended delivery. I wish there were more flashbacks from her time with Ian and her husband. I really loved the ending but I'm glad that a 4th book is on the way. I bought into the wickedness and weirdness of Gage and how powerless Kayla was at resisting him. I'm a sucker for a twisted bad boy.  Gage grew on me at about the 50% mark. Overall I was entertained!Check out the reviews from the rest of group in full animation for the Devil's Trilogy and much more![...]

$REVIEW.: This is a sweet love story about forever, one of those books based on a small town where there is an important family with gorgeous brothers
And since the town is Napa, wine is king


In this one, Trey DeLuca is running scared because his older brothers have all fallen like pins into the love/marriage virus and he doesn't want to be the next victim

When he comes unwillingly back to town, summoned by his gramdmother, he's forced to stay for a month in order to partner her in the Valentine's Day dance
Then he meets Sara, the dance teacher who will give him dance lessons and he's a goner but he still wants to protect himself

Sara is a widow, still recovering from her loss but decided to move on

She has a little boy, Cooper, who has to be her first priority


It was a joy to watch how Trey sucumbs to the charm of all his nieces and Cooper, falls victim to his sisters-in-law pregnancy hormones and his nonna and old girlfriends' wiles

It was charming, fun and sweet.

$review_text.: Loved, loved this.  One of the best erotic romance for me this year.  Loved the BDSM in this story.I was so captivated with this book that I finished this one in one day.  My underwear was sizzling with this one!!  Had some dark parts that blended well with the story.  Sexxa Kohl did a great job with this book and she has become one of my all time favorite in erotica.This story was all about sex and redemption, the characters fit perfectly together in this story that it felt so real and it has you captivated until the end of the book.  It couldn't get any hotter than what it was with these two very opposite characters that seem to fit so well together.Blaire, goes by the name Raven at Club Climax.  She is a young, beautiful, smart and innocent girl with beautiful long black hair, who has men falling at her feet when she's working at Club Climax as Raven.  Blaire was thrown into a lifestyle that wasn't for her but had no choice to be in.  She was fighting really hard to keep her innocence intact, but for her mother who was in desperate need she would go as far as selling her soul to the devil.  Raven works as a stripper at Club Climax and is struggling with keeping her two personalities apart.  She seems to be captivated by a beautiful man when she hooks her eyes on him.Jaxxon is a drop dead, sexy rich and pretentious alpha who is into being a Dom, with a dark side to him.  He is a man with dark needs and desires who is not sorry for his unapologetic attitude for obtaining whatever it is that he wants and whenever he wants. He seems to always want control and dominance, it's something that he needs and always gets.  The moment he lays his eyes on Blaire he instantly feels and knows that she's someone that he wants and needs and he will go through no limits to have her.  Blaire seems to have woken something in him that he thought was not possible and for that he will do whatever he has to, to have her.These two people seem to clash and explode.They start off with a two week agreement of domination but seems to have turned into much more and both are surprised that this has turned out to be more than what they expected out of it.  Raven is thrown blinded into this agreement without knowing who this mysterious man who has requested her services is, love seems to grow upon them, even though Blaire has no idea who this man is, she seems to be captivated by him and wants to be with him and he goes into this not knowing that his feelings will turn into more than just passion for this woman.This was a very emotional and sizzling hot read.  Love how the identities unfold and the acts of passion are just hot, hot, hot!!  Makes me wish I had a Jaxxon!A definite must read! I am looking forward to reading more by this great and amazing author!

$REVIEW.: As a fan of teacher/student stories, I was excited to read this after all the reviews it got. I don't know if my expectations were high but I felt like this was just an average read. After reading so many stories with this theme, I guess I was expecting to be impressed but it didn't meet my hopes.I didn't quite connect with Ashlyn although I did like her. There were some major events in the book that I felt needed more attention but it was just glossed over. The writing didn't pull me in consistently- there were times that I skimmed over and other times I highlighted half the page. I did like the song lyrics that prefaced every chapter- it was unique.The only consistent thing I loved was Mr. Daniels! Oh my he stole my heart with every movement and word spoken!So this book was a mixed bag for me- I loved it at times and other times I contemplated abandoning the story all together! I guess overall it was just an OK read with a very lovable male heroine.

$review_text.: The author creates short profiles of various dog personalities in an attempt to help a brother and sister choose a dog. Each type of dog features a cartoon drawing followed by a subjective description and then a photograph of the actual type of dog. This book is targeted for children age two through six.The pictures are rather small; there is no zoom feature, and the text to speech feature is much too quick for a child this age to understand. There are a few editing and formatting errors.On the other hand, children who love dogs will enjoy the pictures and older children will appreciate the author's sense of humor. The choice of dog breeds is rather selective; some of the more popular breeds like the labrador, beagle and shih tzu are not mentioned. A family just starting out in their search for a family dog might find the book useful as a starting point in their search.

$REVIEW.: I have spent almost my entire knitting life (which, granted, isn't very long) looking for good, very wearable patterns for men. I have spent hours looking for a argyle men's cardigan on the internet. I have spent sleepless nights thinking about what I'm going to knit my men for Christmas (not really, but still). And I have found both an argyle cardigan pattern and 26 other patterns that are completely wonderful and wearable! I could knit every single pattern in this book!The only difficulty I have is the pattern sizes. My brother wears a size 36 sweater(and he's an adult. sort of). So I have to adjust the patterns to fit his size (does anyone know how to adjust patterns? Cause I'm not very good at it). But I have knit the beanie pattern for him, and it turned out very nicely!This is an amazing collection of knitting patterns! I love it and will use it for years to come until I've knit every pattern about fifty times.

$review_text.: For those looking for the soundbite, Allberry has written a wonderfully gentle yet firm book in support of the pro-sanctity of marriage side of the homosexual debate. However, limiting the book to that description does immense injustice to Allberry's position. He is not interested so much in taking a side in the public debate as he is interested in God, His unqualified love, and people themselves (on both sides). The book's title, which ends up proving more nuanced and relevant to his position than it appears at first, amplifies what Allberry is really trying to do. Is God anti-gay? No. He is pro-people. God sent His Son into the world to become the "bread of life" (John 6:35):"The great gift Jesus gives us is himself. He is not the means to some other end. It is not that the bread of life is something else, and Jesus happens to be the one who dispenses it. He himself is this bread. It is Jesus who satisfies our deepest emotional and spiritual needs. He is the prize--for all of us, irrespective of our issues and complexities. Anyone who comes to him will find fullness of life... And so precious is this gift that God cannot be truly said to be "anti" anyone to whom this wonderful gift is being offered" (Kindle Locations 875-880).There's the gist, I think, equally covered from both ends of the spectrum. From the pro-homosexual perspective, know that this book is not endorsing your position. From the Christian perspective, know that this book is not does not consider homosexuality to be some sort of cultural plague sweeping across America. Rather, the book is an endeavor to present a biblically faithful position on homosexuality through a gospel-centered lens within an atmosphere of utmost respect, sensitivity, and genuineness.To put that summary into a fuller context, let's first consider Mr. Allberry. When reading any book about a hot-button issue, examining the author will almost always tell you as much about the book as what it actually says. The author's worldview, made up of presuppositions, beliefs, and experiences, is therefore vitally important to understanding the message being conveyed. Where is this author coming from? What are his core beliefs? These will show you the behind the scenes logic and assumptions at work and thereby indicate what stock you can put into his objectivity, truthfulness, and correctness about his subject (or lack thereof).In the case of Is God anti-gay?, Sam Allberry tells us the key components necessary for such an authorial analysis in his introduction. Of first importance from my perspective, and I would argue a larger Christian perspective, is biblical and theological integrity. How well does Allberry rightly divided the Word of truth? I would say he is faithful to the relevant biblical texts and therefore accompanying biblical theology regarding the issue. In plain English, that means the book views homosexuality as something sinful requiring repentance. This book is written by someone with the guts to say the gospel is a message for all people:"When Jesus burst onto the scene, he didn't subdivide humanity into categories and give each one a separate message. One for the introverts; another for the extroverts. One (with logical charts and bullet points) for left-brain types, and one (with different colours and ambient music) for the right-brain folk. God's message for gay people is the same as his message for everyone. Repent and believe. It is the same invitation to find fullness of life in God, the same offer of forgiveness and deep, wonderful, life-changing love" (Kindle Locations 57-62.And for that stark and unrelenting stand for the gospel of Jesus, I salute you Mr. Allberry.Before any knee-jerk objections are voiced however, I would also add that the same man, who is unashamedly committed to the biblical gospel, is also one who has personally wrestled with the subject under discussion. In his introduction and at different points throughout the book, Allberry talks about his experience with homosexual desires. This man has lived it and is therefore especially equipped to understand, empathize with, and speak to homosexuals. In fact, I see him as a great moderator between the two positions. On the Christian side, he is committed to truth of Scripture. On the homosexual side, he is one who has been there and gone through it and knows the reality of same-sex attraction. All things considered, Allberry is a solid voice, thoroughly qualified on all sides to address the issue of homosexuality from a Christian perspective.Outline-wise, Allberry begins his short treatise (and it is a short book) by making a positive case for biblical sex and marriage, as that is a more elemental aspect of the homosexual conversation. To understand homosexuality, we must first understand sexuality. He then looks at what the Bible has to say about homosexuality, hitting all the key verses (Gen. 19; Jude 7; Lev. 18 and 20; Rom. 1; 1 Cor. 6; and 1 Tim. 1). He then answers objectors' common questions: Surely a same-sex partnership is OK if it's committed and faithful? But Jesus never mentions homosexuality, so how can it be wrong? Then he turns his survey to Christianity and considers homosexuality from an individual Christian's and the collective Church's respective vantage points. Again, he addresses important questions: Aren't we just picking and choosing which Old Testament laws apply? Can't Christians just agree to differ on this? My non-Christian friend has just told me they're gay. How should I respond? What should I do if a Christian comes out to me?Throughout the treatment, Allberry is candid, sincere, and just plain right on about what he's saying. You'll find profound distinctions about homosexuals not commonly realized by both sides of the issue; keen observations and analogies to illustrate difficult topics; and a real warmth saturating all that Allberry is saying.If you've never really done a formal study of Christianity and homosexuality, then this is a good place to start. Allberry is biblical, charitable, and succcinct. He writes the truth in love, sacrificing neither faithfulness to the biblical texts nor compassion for the real people dealing with these issues on both sides of the discussion. Before closing, this last point is worthy of underscoring. Allberry is as careful to ease a Christian, with convictions that homosexuality is sinful, into a biblical position within the conversation as he is sensitive to those struggling with (or outright embracing) homosexuality. Often times the latter is emphasized without much attention to the former. Historically, such an approach may have been helpful, as the homosexual movement was much smaller in the past and society as a whole had not been as welcoming towards it. So when the issue was addressed from a Christian perspective, Christians had both the Bible and culture on their side. In the past few years however, that cultural support has waned, and homosexuality has been cast in a much more positive light within the public square and is jointly more easily accepted by today's youth. In other words, the power positions, for lack of a better description, have essentially been equalizing. Consequently, Christian literature addressing the subject should take into account the current cultural temperature and speak to Christians on the pro-sanctity of marriage side accordingly. This means no more assuming that the Christian position is the given norm and no more leaning on both "general morality" and tradition for the validity of the Christian position. Instead, it means showing how a Christian can hold onto their position in an increasingly post-Christian society that is becoming evermore intolerant of its views; and it means showing how Christians can establish their views more from a purely biblical and loving standpoint, as opposed to looking to popular consensus and peppering it with a couple proof texts or blanket theological statement. In other words, it means putting on humility and preparing to take up a cross.So again, if you're looking to generically classify Is God anti-gay? by the labels standing on either side of the homosexual debate, it is a conservative, traditional, and/or fundamental book. Put negatively, it's the quote "bigoted, narrowminded, old-fashioned" perspective that is out of touch with reality. Put positively, it's the biblical, Christian, and, dare I say it, right side of the debate. Personally, I would classify the book as simple, charming, and what every Christian needs to read. I'm tempted to quote him at length, but that wouldn't be fair to Mr. Allberry. Do yourself a favor and pick up this little gem, full of balanced truth and heart. Having its homely, personal, and thoroughly God-centered wisdom will surely pay off in the days ahead.As a note, I received a free copy of this book via Cross Focused Reviews, courtesy of The Good Book Company.

However, just because we feel that pull towards the internet doesn't mean we have to be a slave to it's addictive properties.Sarah Mae's book is all about balance.  She wants to help you use social media and the internet without it being a hole that takes up endless hours of your day.  In short, she wants to help you take control and live the life that you want to live.The advice is nothing really new.  After all, no mother really wants to be on the internet more than she wants to be present in her children's lives.  Much of the advice is commonsense.  However, the meat of the book is a fourteen day plan to help you take practical steps to take control of your internet usage and to plug back into your family.

$review_text.: plus a change, plus c'est la mme chose  - The more things change, the more they stay the same  --  Jean-Baptiste Alphonse Karr; 1849, Jan issue Les GupesLes Miserables deals about the same issues we have today: social progress, compulsory schools, insurrections, revolutions, capitalism, socialism, oppressive governments, war, war weariness.Hugo is a great story teller but I have to admit, my eyes crossed during the treatises on the Battle of Waterloo, history of French revolutions and insurrections, history of sewers, catholic convents, philosophies
I reread many of those pages, sometimes a couple of times.The advice in other reviewers to have a dictionary handy and some French history knowledge proved to be very valuable


 I used the dictionary on my phone, which wasn't nearly good enough as many of the words I looked up were not recognized
A good French dictionary would have been a good thing to have, which I did not and so there were large passages (mostly song ditties) that I did not understand

 I spent a goodly amount of time looking up bits of French history on Wikki.Hugo addressed many of the interpersonal issues common today
 Child abuse, child abandonment, love for a child by parents denied custody, estrangements caused by pride and misunderstanding, the loneliness of the elderly and of course, romance
( I am sure Marius would have been arrested for stalking today


 :-D )The most well known story line is that of Jean ValJean and his soul's purchase by a priest with a set of candlesticks


An incredible story of  temptations and redemption but it is only one of the story lines that will touch your heart.This book is well worth the time to read but be forewarned - it is not an easy read but it will stay with you.It has been stated that the kindle version is abridged

 It is not


 It is an unabridged version

 The book has been subdivided into 'books' - the 218 pages refers to one of those.

$SUMMARY.: I've become obsessed.

$REVIEW.: This is the perfect companion to Janet Arnold's books. Both books cover many of the same garments.  Arnold's books detail the actual garment and this book details how the garment was probably constructed. The detail of the photos is both instructive and amazing - and in color too. As previous reviewers have noted, the garments range from fairly simple to construct (shifts, headcloths, and handkerchefs) to very complex.The authors, in the introduction, mention one of the imputus for this book was to allow researcher, designers, and students of costume to see the details of construction without the actual garments having to be handled.  This allows more of us to see how the garments were constructed and to preserve the items for future generations.I recommend this book and look forward to the rest of the series.

$review_text.: This book is not for the faint of heart or those shy of blushing from the topics encased within

The warning at the start about sexuality and scenes containing such is much needed for within the first few pages you are already well engaged in sexual conversation.Zombies, witches, fairies, angels..

and that's just in the first chapter


If you are one for fantasy, and sexuality this book is the must have of your bookshelf or kindle.I loved how descriptive and witty the author was in writing each character


You can really feel the characters voice throughout the whole story and by the end feel as though you have actually known these people in real life
The author really is a great story-teller.I would recommend this to anyone who loves adult fiction or is looking to develop a taste for this genre as this is one of those must read books.

He raised himself in the mountains. The story is very interesting, weaving Wolfs life into a tale of meeting three prostitutes, helping them out of the mountains. Tangling with the army, running from a U.S. Marshall, and that covers only part of the story. Good reading even the second time!

This book was vivid, raw, suspenseful and I felt like I was there through every experience.

Being from the Newark area I know that every event in this book was realistic and it proved that the street life isn't one to be glorified. I can't wait for part 2

I really couldn't stop reading them.

$review_text.: Jeremy Stroeb's parents were very disappointed when he left college to traipse around Europe with not much more than a backpack while he sought the meaning of life. In reality, he was trying to step out of the long shadow left by his parents.Suddenly, Jeremy is confronted with the mysterious murders of his parents in their own home. He returns home to search for answers to the seemingly senseless killings and to look out for his sister, Elise.When police show no progress in identifying the murderers, Jeremy decides to seek answers for himself. He decides to pursue possible clues in his parent's respective professions. Toward that end, he enrolls in the university where his father taught, and takes a job in his mother's accounting firm.In his pursuir of the truth, he finds his self-proclaimed perfect parents weren't who he thought they were. His search for the truth also places he and his sister in grave danger as he draws closer to solving the mystery of the death of his parents.In Their Blood is the debut suspense thriller written by Sharon Potts. She ably takes Jeremy from a freewheeling globetrotter through a series of life-changing situations where he must grow to become a man. Along the way, he stumbles more than once, but manages to pull his own weight under extremely difficult circumstances.This book is typical of those that readers try to put down, but find themselves totally engrossed. The pace is quick and steady, the atmosphere menacing when necessary, and the characters developed in such a way as to reveal the depth of their goodness or evilness.Ms. Potts has a remarkable way of drawing the reader into the depth of the vileness of the antagonist as she leads readers to the shocking conclusion. It is difficult to walk away from this book. The coming-of-age story stirs the soul and leaves the reader looking forward to the next story from this fabulous author.

$REVIEW.: Dragon Maid is book number two in the Dragon Lore series. It started right where book one left off. Dragon Maid is full of love, lust, action and adventure. I loved falling into the world of dragons and combined world of ancients= and modern day time. The characters in this book are packed full of pride, love and determination. I loved the instant connection between Britta and Jonathan. Britta is a dragon shifter who is bonded to Tarika the dragon. Britta is a mage from ancient times who is brought forward in time to help save Earth. What she does not expect to find is her destined mate and life partner, Jonathan. Jonathan is a witch who has stronger power than he has ever given into and he learns just who he is and what his power can do because of Britta. Ann Gimpel is a very talented author who steals her readers attention from the very first page. Ann is able to describe her characters, their emotions and settings in great detail. I absolutely loved Dragon Maid and truly hope there is a third book in this series! Thank you Ms. Gimpel for another wonderful book!

$review_text.: For more reviews of Andrew Grey's books, visit [...]Rating: 4.75 starsJerry Lincoln moved back to Sioux Falls, SD to take care of his grandfather and stayed on after his death.  It seemed the perfect place to live and work, especially since Jerry's small IT consulting business is run out of his home.  As Jerry's business grew, his friend talked him into hiring additional help in the form of  IT students from the local college. Of the two men Jerry hired, John Black Raven made Jerry's thoughts turn to things other than computer code, something that hadn't happened in a long time.John Black Raven needs this job and for two very specific reasons, his nephew and niece currently caught up in the SD Child Services Agency and placed with a foster family.  John has been trying to get them back since his sister died with little luck.  Now that he has a good job, John is hoping to prevail in his fight to bring his nephew and niece home for good.As John and Jerry get to know one another, they start to realize that the relationship being formed is one that will last the rest of their lives and John starts to accept that Jerry will stand by his  side in his fight with Child Services.  Jerry is shocked to find out that Native American children are seen as a source of income by SD Child Services , the agency caught up in politics, greed, and bigotry.  It will take everything the men have got and more to fight the system and bring the children home.I know I can always count on a well written story with characters of substance from Andrew Grey, but this book surpassed my expectations and then some.  The serious subject matter at the heart of this story was one I was unaware of just as Jerry Lincoln is at the beginning of the book.  I have to admit it sent me on a search for more information, and I was horrified to find out that the situation explored by  Andrew Grey in this story was actually far worse in detail.  It is a heartbreaking case and one that Andrew Grey brings to life realistically and poignantly in The Good Fight. I won't go into additional details here but will say that you should look up the situation on your own.  It will shock and appall you that things of this nature are still able to occur now with the government's casual oversight and approval.  When reading this book, I thought surely Grey is overstating the issue, and I should have known better.  If anything he used Jerry (as the mouthpiece for the reader) to voice the amazement and horror we would feel over discovering such a misplacement of judgement and child abuse at the hands of government officials.  Any channel that helps to make people aware of the plight of South Dakota's Native Americans fight to reclaim their youth should be applauded.  And The Good Fight brings this issue to the reader with heart, immediacy, and a well researched story.  Kudos to Andrew Grey for every aspect of this remarkable story.Now normally i would talk about characters first, but the subject matter just begged to be put first.  The characters of Jerry Lincoln and John Black Raven are well crafted, full of the flaws and layers I have come to expect from this author.  I liked Jerry, a person still caught up in his grief over the loss of his grandfather, the family member who understood and supported him throughout his life.  Jerry is caught up in his IT world, leaving his house only at his friend's invitation or to shop for personal needs, like food.  Only the growth of his business forces Jerry to interact with others, this time his employees to a wonderful result.  I loved not only Jerry, but his friends, Peter and Leonard, a couple who have taken Jerry into their hearts.  Through their interactions with Jerry, we actually learn more about Jerry's past, his grandfather and his current situation.John Black Raven, a terrific character on his  own, is also used to inform the reader about the plight of Native Americans, not only with regard to the deplorable situation with their children and Child Services, but with the bigotry and racism that is evident not only in South Dakota but elsewhere in the United States.  That is a heavy weight to put on one character but John Black Raven, as written by Andrew Grey, is certainly up to the task.Finally, there is Bryce Morgan, the other man Jerry employes.  Bryce is a character easy to connect with, so I was thrilled to hear that the sequel to The Good Fight, moves Bryce up from a secondary character to a main one. It is a position he deserves.If I have any issues with this book, it is that I wished for more resolution for the problems with SD Child Services than what occurs at the end of the book.  I am just not sure I should lay that at Andrew Grey's doorstep.  While he did resolve the case of John's niece and nephew, the problems of  disappearing children, well over 700, have yet to be put to rights in almost every way.  So that frustration lingered after the book was over and maybe that is as it should be.  Like a burr too close to the skin, a little irritation can move people to action, even if only to sign a petition. So pick up The Good Fight, you get a wonderful, heartwarming story along with a shocking tale of modern injustice that needs to move into the media mainstream.  And there is a sequel to be read next, The Fight Within.  I can't wait.  But start here first and check  back with me on the latter.  Again kudos to Andrew Grey, for a remarkable story that is big enough to encompass a love affair while shedding light on the ongoing plight of Native Americans out west.  It does justice to both.Cover art by Anne Cain.  While I loved that Native American man in the background, the character in front is not my idea of Jerry Lincoln, a misstep in an otherwise gorgeous cover.

Talented, hot, emotionally closed off and obviously harboring a lot of pain. Definitely up there with some of my all time fav characters.Jess-I must admit...it wasn't love at first read with Jesse. While I understood immediately the kind of person he was and why, he took a little while to grow on me, but in the end, he so totally did. Something about his youthful honesty made him completely lovable.The side characters are good, too. Brandon! Oh how I wish he was my big brother! And Kenny...though at first I wasn't too sure about him, but ultimately he was awesome, too. Trish...was anyone else hoping she would slip on a drum stick and break her neck, or was that just me?There were a few things that personally didn't work for me, the whole super rich, look at my car collection, etc...is kinda...&#34;eh&#34; to me leaning toward annoying, but I got over it.I loved how the relationship developed, even though it was quick, it didn't feel forced and I could in fact feel something between them. The banter about their ages had me giggling at several points and there was some serious hotness...not just hot, but sweet hotness and that's the best!To be very honest a lot of times when &#34;lyrics&#34; are included I end up not really enjoying them, but I think the lyrics in this book did so much to convey emotion that I really appreciated them.

After being in the hospital for a day or so, she is better, but Virginia will have a long frustrating recovery ahead of her.Virginia will have to learn to gain her strength back all over again and regain her speech as well. She sits in despair every day in the nursing home and is growing very bitter. Things turn around though when Ed Cleworth, Mae's former boss comes calling. Ed lost his wife Willa years before and is lonely. This is a turning point for Virginia, and she begins to snap out of her depression better and starts to recover.David, Peter's dad and Virginia's son comes to town when Virginia first has her stroke, but then does not stay around when he is most needed. As a symphony orchestra conductor, music has been his whole life above and beyond everyone else. And when he up and leaves yet again, Peter is killing mad. So he and his dad have another falling out after this happens. They may never make amends either.Jessie, Virginia's little friend, is very upset when Virginia has her stroke and they don't see each other for a long time after. The worst thing too is that Steve, her dad has began drinking again and this is doubly hard for the young girl. When Steve meets and falls for Virginia's therapist, Anna, Jessie sees her as a sort of new mom and has hopes that her dad will marry.Trudy, Mae's sister marries Bert Biddle in this sequel, and Bert's parents would like for Bert to buy the family property with the farm and everything so that Bert can be close to his work there. Bert's long lost twin brother Fred shows up though after not even keeping in contact for a couple years, and expects the property for his own and his new Russian wife, Sletvana. Things are very tense when he and his wife move in until they can find a place. And Lillian, difficult as she always is, automatically despises her new daughter-in-law. Trudy and Sletvana strike up an instant friendship, and Mae becomes very jealous as this has caused a division in their special sisterly relationship since they've always been really close.Peter is worried about the farm going under as well since the weather conditions have turned against it. And with milk prices going the way they are too, things are even worse. He tries to get some other help with the bank loan so they can hopefully wait for things to turn around.I enjoyed this book thoroughly and would like to see yet another installment written, but am not sure if there will be. Depree is an excellent writer.

Many accomplished writers are publishing Singlets now, and they make for a good afternoon's entertainment.As a recent fan on the Eskkar series, I was excited to see another story starring Bracca - a fascinating character from Eskkar's past.

$review_text.: This is the second book in Lily Harlem's Hot Ice Series, and she has yet to disappoint me. The sex is hot, the characters are both damaged in a way that makes them so real and approachable, and yet the story was able to flow so quickly that the Epilogue came way too soon. Having read the full three books in this series (hopefully with more to come soon) I can tell you that Lily Harlem is someone to watch for when looking for a great book to have a lazy reading day with. Each book in this series has had characters that are so easy to relate to that they seemed like people you would meet on the street, while at the same time being fantasy enough to rev anyone one's engine. The Hot Ice Series would make a great edition to anyone's TBR and I can't wait to see what else she has in store for her readers in the future.

$REVIEW.: I actually enjoyed this book.  I will say I do wish there was more to it.  There was so much that needed to be explained about their relationship.  Feelings etc.  I mean neither one of them said &#34;I love you&#34; when I know darn well they did.  So, I think the author jipped us on the relationship bit of Laney and Alrick.  Kinda disappointing.  There are more books to this series which I will be reading because I did enjoy it.  I might wait to read them when I find them on sale or cheaper.  Especially considering I was let down a little.  I will say I was entertained enough that I read it in one sitting.  I so would have given this a 4 if the relationship was talked about more often in the book.  It wasn't so thats why the 3 stars.  Reason I say that is because of the flow of the back and forth between them.  Yes their relationship was VERY physical but you could really tell that something wasn't being said and written with the way the author was writing the book.  I think they messed up there.  Maybe the next will be better?  I hope!

$review_text.: This book contains two of my all time favorite plotlines: opposites attracting and friends that turn into lovers.  Taryn Plendl managed to combine both of these elements into one great book that is also sexy, fun and an outright fantastic read.  I loved the two main characters- of Avery and Blake.  One is a head in the clouds, adorable, and quirky romance novelist while the other is a hunk of walking man love.  Avery and Blake meet and bond over a very awkward situation that cements their friendship.  This friendship has great sexual chemistry that eventually leads to so much more.  These characters were well written as was the entire story.  This is a shorter read but does not suffer for it.  If you enjoy love, laughter, sexual sparks, a hot lead character then you need to read SO MUCH MORE.4.5 out of 5 stars

$review_text.: Romanian born Cristian Mihai's story, A Sad, Sad Symphony, instantly transported me to Trans Siberian Orchestra's Beethoven's Last Night. Though the two stories had minimal comparisons, the tones matched enough to make me think of this wonderful production I've only had the privilege to see once.I'm a huge fan of parallel stories, and characters whose paths follow the same direction to merge into a matched position of learning, or who play off the other unawares, or some similar story progression. It seemed that this was what Cristian was doing with Francis Goyer and Oscar, though at the end I was left slightly confused.There definitely needed to be more in the development of these characters triggers. I was left wanting more information, understanding what the author was going for, but feeling he'd fallen just short in truly reaching that place where the reader could understand the majesty of these artists. I was instantly immersed in the setting, but disappointed I wasn't taken far enough into the psyches of the characters.I was confused by the ending because I felt I was left interpreting more than I wished, wondering if Oscar was directly influenced by Francis' end. And wasn't Francis much younger? Or maybe the stories didn't parallel as closely as I'd assumed. I found myself re-reading to make sure I hadn't missed something, though I think, clearly, I had.Along with instantly feeling the setting of the story, I enjoyed Cristian's writing style, though his dialogue was a little inconsistent. Overall, a good story that might benefit greatly from another editors point of view.

$review_text.: It took me a long time to read this book, as I kept falling asleep after a few pages. Despite the dramatic historical events, the narrative itself is quite flat. The author tries to counteract this with a liberal sprinkling of sexual exploits...many of them homosexual. This recurring theme became as tedious as the rest of the narrative. I found myself losing track of characters and having to constantly search for earlier references to try to figure out who they were. Perhaps the rather pedantic writing of the narrator was a deliberate literary device. The book has a lot of archaic-sounding phrases and reads like it was translated from another language...all of which was probably intentional. Deficiencies of style, plot construction, and focus  have been noted by other reviewers. For some people, the political merit seems to outweigh the literary failings, but this wasn't the case for me.

I was expecting a lot of great low sodium recipes, but I also got tons of information on the importance of a low sodium diet and how to make small changes in your diet to make a big difference. The book mentions tons of good foods to aim for, foods to avoid at all costs and, of course, plenty of recipes for every single meal of the day, including dessert! It&#8217;s amazing to see how many great tasting foods can stay in your diet AND be low in sodium. If anyone is in need of a low sodium diet, or might need one down the line, I'd pick up this book.

$review_text.: I enjoyed this book and appreciate the free copy I received in exchange for my unbiased review.The story is interesting and somehow believable in spite of the obvious science fiction involved. Unfortunately, I never really connected with many of the characters the way the author seemed to intend... I kept expecting more focus on minor characters and relationships that were introduced in great detail, and a few major character shifts felt too sudden. The romantic elements are awkward, but maybe that's true to life for teenagers. ;-)Note: There is some pretty strong language and a brutal rape/murder that would make me hesitant to recommend this to young teens, and definitely not to tweens! I might have given it four stars if I hadn't felt it was inappropriate the target YA audience.On the positive side, I like the way creativity is encouraged and the sanctity of life is discussed. I just wish the telling of the story had been more captivating. I would consider reading a sequel in hopes of learning more about what happened.

$review_text.: This is another installment in the Last Chance series.  In this book, we see Hannah and Jake fall in love and end up together.  The Matheson&#8217;s are at it again.  I like the book and it was a pretty easy read.  However, I think the depiction of the Matteson family was less than stellar.  How anyone would ever want to be part of this dysfunctional group is beyond me.  Holt Matheson is a bully, a jerk and not a good example of a loving father.  In addition to forcing Jake and Hannah to act based on a stupid threat, he encourages his other sons to fight among themselves and does little to show how he ever got to the position of patriarch in this family. It amazed me that someone could show a father who would rather see his son in an unhappy marriage just to keep the Matheson line going rather than show the maturity to know that any marriage based on such an absurd premise is doomed from the get-go and could cause his son, not to mention his son&#8217;s wife, years of unhappiness and possibly financial ruin. What a &#8220;marvelous&#8221; example he sets for his sons! It is no wonder they are, for the most part, the jerks they are.  His wife doesn&#8217;t deserve much credit either, since she obviously has put up with this for many years&#8212;yes, a wife can change a husband, though not easily. The other sons are not presented much better&#8212;even Jake has some problems dealing with the situations. Jake&#8217;s Hannah also allows herself to be intimidated and bullied by Holt&#8212;another good example of a present day, strong woman! On top of that, she aspires to be a vet.  I am not sure she has the wherewithal or maturity to deal with schooling and/or the career she so dearly wants.  I have read the other books in the series.  This one, while entertaining, has some rather preposterous underlying themes and puts them forth in a somewhat immature manner. I am not sure why the author did this, except to show just how ridiculous her thought processes can be or how difficult it can be to create plot after plot after plot.  Perhaps the time to end the series has come and gone. Needless to say, I was disappointed with this book, as I enjoyed the others I read.  They all are based on rather preposterous assumptions and/or themes, but his one is by far the wildest.  I think a reader looking for pure escapism might like this one. It is definitely and easy read.  I received this from Library Thing to read and review.

$review_text.: From the very first chapter I was hooked to this book! Surprising, fun, and so different from the other paranormal books that I've read


Cristy Rey does an excellent job with bringing the characters to life and portraying the scenes with such finesse and details, it makes the book feel &#34;real&#34;.The story starts off with Sunday, a witch on the run

She has amazing and kick ass mutha-effin powers and is the Incarnate

She's kept herself hidden away for years and somehow ends up diving right back into the world of magic; with the help of her besties
Filled with suspense, drama, and hard hitting action; this book has it all! Then there is Cyrus, the werewolf that is sent to hunt down Sunday and bring her back to the Coven
Wheewwww!! Cyrus is hot, hot, hot! I loved him so much


Tortured soul with always wanting to do the right thing and make up for his past mistakes.The instant and undeniable attraction between Sunday and Cyrus melted my heart
I felt for them both and I admired the fact that they both had their priorities; to save their friends, their family, and each other
The writing was on point and very descriptive; at some points I felt I was watching a movie


When all else fails, who do you turn to?Overall, this was a fantastic read and as a HUGE paranormal fan, I am definitely going to recommend this book to all of my friends! Amazing debut and I can't wait for more!

The goats are the hundreds of observers who knew what was going on, including the 700 members of the Luzerne County Bar, the Judicial Conduct Board and the PA Supreme Court, all of whom ignored the selling of children by the judges until the federal government indicted the two main culprits.

$review_text.: I picked up a copy of Ted Dekker's The Bride Collector because it was a hard copy, and it was on sale for $6.98. I love a bargain almost as much as I like a good read, and as stories go this one was ok. It was a cross between a thriller and a mystery, with a little romance thrown in. Unfortunately the characters' weren't entirely believable for me, not enough to get me to stop reading the book, but enough that it didn't sit well with me either.Quite frankly I think Mr. Dekker should have taken the story into the realm of science fiction, or even fantasy and embraced it wholeheartedly. The character of Paradise was crafted to be special but flawed, and she was, but she could have been so much more. If Paradise's talents had transcended the bounds of normalcy, then for me, the story would have jelled, become more believable and been a really good read. After all, as sci-fi and fantasy readers, aren't we asked to suspend our believe system so we can enjoy the fertile imagination of the author?In my opinion this book is definitely not Christian fiction, there are references to god and to religion, but I didn't think spiritual awareness was a main driver in this book.I would buy another Ted Dekker book...if it was on sale.Review written by Shelley Riley author ofCasual Lies-A Triple Crown Adventure

$REVIEW.: Julia Dweck uses witty rhyme in her new book, Humpfree The Humpless Camel, to teach children to embrace the characteristics that make them unique.Unlike the other camels, Humpfree is missing his humps. He sets out on a comical adventure to find humps he can call his own, but nothing seems to fit just right. Humpfree tries balloons that cause him to float away, boulders that weigh him down, feathers that tickle, and much more, but soon gives up in despair. Will Humpfree ever discover how rare and special he really is?The illustrations by Young-Min Yun are rich and vibrant, adding to the story's humor. My favorite image is when Humpfree lands pancaked in the sand after the balloons fail. Children and parents will be delighted with the illustrator's lighthearted creations.Children learn that each of us posses our own special qualities that should be celebrated because it's these unique traits that make us one of a kind.I highly recommend picking up Humpfree the Humpless Camel.

$REVIEW.: Cross My Heart by Katie Klein is an intriguing novel filled with romance, suspense and unsuspected plot twists. Klein delivers a stunning and surprising story with well developed, witty characters who keep you hooked until the very last page. Jaden, the over-achieving philanthropist, and Parker, the mysterious outcast, take you on an unforgettable journey, and just when you think you have it all figured out -BAM- it gets even better. When I began this novel I expected your typical bad-boy love story, but Cross My Heart exceeded all of my expectations. These days, it is rare young adult novels catch me so completely off guard. So, thank you Klein, for delivering an original, unpredictable love story that got me hooked without giving everything away.I gave Cross My Heart 5 STARS. I thought it was a brilliant read, and I challenge everyone to read this novel.

In book 3, the drama, romance and family saga will have you so into this read you will not want to put it down.  It answers all about Drew and Alex's family up bringing and why they are the men they are today. I read this in one sitting.  Ginger's writing is amazing and although this story has a happy ending it's not without shedding some tears and heart break to get there. Trust me!, this is a series you don't want to miss!

$REVIEW.: I&#8217;ll admit it: I picked this book for its cover. But it was a gamble that paid off.First of all, this is such a clever idea: to take old, creepy photographs and build a story around them. Certainly this isn&#8217;t too far off from the idea of old-fashioned writing prompts, but Riggs does this in such a way that you forget the pictures came before the story.The characters, and plot, were all colorful and engaging. The story was original. It takes a lot to hold my interest nowadays, but I could not put this book down!  From the poignant and honest narration of Jacob, to the gothic Welsh setting, to the very unique characters he meets along the way&#8230; I loved this book, start to finish. My only complaint was that it ended, but thankfully, the next book was already available.I don&#8217;t want to say more for fear of spoiling things, but I cannot recommend this book enough!

$REVIEW.: If there is a manual for perpetuating the myth that mormon women this is it. Our founding formothers would come unhinged at the thought of a book telling women to be passive behind their man. Its ironic that women were once told to go out and become professionals while this book is telling women to treat their husbands as the only important thing in the world and sacrafice everything they hold dear to accomplish it.

$REVIEW.: Ridgeline is a western like the Atomic bomb was only a science experiment. Oh sure, there are plenty of horses, The James Gang, Indians, and gunfights, but there is so much more to this story. Using dynamite  descriptions, inspired narrative, gut-wrenching internalization, humor, (how beit twisted at times,) and characters so deep they had to be channeled, Foster weaves a brilliant story of good versus evil.  Evil, being in the skin of Jeremiah Jones, an ex-Civil War soldier who suffers from  PTSD and who has turned his back on God. Ironic in that he is now a circuit riding saddle-preacher spreading the very word of the Deity he curses.  He also kills. And enjoys it.  True most of the varmints he shoots need killing, but isn&#8217;t he playing the God he so questions?  Then there is the good . . . Adeline.  Dear, sweet Adeline who is innocence itself wrapped up in a pretty bow.  But only at first.  Fate (as it often does) throws these two together. Adeline is both repelled and drawn to this tormented man of the cloth.  And, as women often do, tries to tame the beast within Jeremiah.  So wanting  to find peace, Jeremiah&#8217;s soul wars between the love for Adeline and the hate of battle that holds him captive. Ridgeline is the first novel in The Long Journey Home Series by Pamela Foster.  Read it and yearn for the next book.  You won&#8217;t be disappointed.
$SUMMARY.: Ridgeline is more than just another Western

$REVIEW.: Having good ideas is easy. People do it all the time. The problem comes when the ethereal thought-stuff of a nascent idea has to turn into the hard nuts and bolts of a working innovation. The bigger problem comes in getting that idea, and its value, across to the people who need to participate in its deployment.Ditkoff addresses parts of the process of originating and refining an idea. He acknowledges that the problem is more often one selecting from among many, or refining the good ones, rather than in having the basic idea in the first place. And I have to agree: a good idea gets you, not the other way around. I know I've had some ideas sit like a lump in my stomach until I expressed them, one way or another. His advice applies to many domains - the breadth is helpful, but people who deal in specifics might have trouble narrowing it to their applications. The real innovation in this book lie in treating an idea as a problem in communication. If getting it straight in your own mind and as a working prototype is hard, conveying it to someone else is even harder.The book's real value comes from about 1/3 of its content, towards the end. There, Ditkoff lays out his strategies, almost as a bulleted list, so the busy executive with minimal time can pick them out clearly and succinctly. The first more-than-half of the book expressed the same ideas in user-friendly parable about inventing the wheel. These features represent both a strength and a weakness, depending on your cognitive style - I tends towards a deeper, more thorough style, so Ditkoff's breeziness didn't always work for me. Still, what's here is good, especially Ditkoff's mention of "immersion." Productive minds like those ofTwyla TharpandSantiago Ramon y Cajalstress that, and it's refreshing to see a popular-style book emphasize the value and necessity of plain hard work.-- wiredweird, reviewing a complimentary copy

$REVIEW.: for more of my reviews and thoughts on writing visit, [...]Rating: 4 stars out of 5When Marcus lost his lover Jeremy he lost everything

 Two punks shot and killed his doctor lover over just a few dollars and Marcus and his partner were the ones to find him

 Jeremy's death demolished Marcus, and he needed to do something to help protect the innocent, things he couldn't do while on the force

So Marcus quit his fifteen year job as a detective on the police force and became a private detective
 He quit sleeping and he gave up on love


 Then Marcus spots  Ben, a young man prostituting himself on the bad streets of Atlanta and things begin to change.Ben has been damaged badly by his past but is still struggling for a better life for himself

 To pay for grad school and living expenses, Ben is whoring himself out on the streets of Atlanta
 Only another year or so and then he will be done


 A past traumatic event has convinced Ben that sex is only tolerable when it is fast and anonymous


And paid for.Against their wishes, the men find themselves falling into a relationship


 But Ben's past arrives and shatters everything, the budding romance and Ben's fragile existence.City Knight is a monster of a book crammed into a mere 50 pages


 T.A

Webb skillfully frames out Marcus' and Ben's past traumas, then with descriptive slashes of anguish and threat, delivers the start of a pain-filled journey to love and redemption for both men and the readers.The first in a series, City Knight switches point of view from Ben to Marcus so the reader can see what events has brought each damaged man to their present day situation
 This format works here beautifully to impress upon the reader just how damaged and conflicted these men are as neither has moved past the events that succeeded in destroying their lives

Webb's characters clash and then start to come together, reawakening their desires for intimacy and sex

 It's painful, and realistic
 It's also grubby ,desperate but also starts to show slivers of hope for each of them.At that point, the reader is quite naturally uneasy as we have come to expect the worst for each man, and Webb delivers that too in a heart crunching cliffhanger that will haunt you and leave you wanting more immediately

 I used to mark down stories that ended in this way but have come to accept this ending as long as it is a part of a series or serialized stories like this one.In this case, Webb has set the stage for the next story in the series, while leaving the reader ramped up in anxiety and anticipation for the events to follow

 I can't wait (and didn't have to)


 My review for the next in the series follows shortly
 Read these tales one at a time or cobble them up in one reading, it works both ways

 I loved City Knights and think you will too.Stories in the City Knight series in the order they were written and should be read to understand the characters and events to follow:City Knight (City Knight #1)Knightmare (City Knight #2)Starry Knight (City Knight #3)Knights Out (City Knight #4)Book Details:ebook, 50 pagesPublished February 15th 2013 by A Bear on Books (first published February 13th 2013)ISBN13 9781937252380edition language Englishseries City Knight

$review_text.: I received an ARC from the author for my honest review.Before reading this book I highly recommend reading the first book in the series because some things you won't understand and well you will ruin the ending of the first book!So this one has a little love triangle thing going on between Molly; the small town girl with big plans to move to Nashville, Nick; the super rich and successful business dude (I can't remember exactly what he does) and Zeke; the lead singer in a rock band!!Molly is one of Hannah's (from the first book) best friends from home
So of course we get some more into Hannah and Jason life together!!At first Molly really has a difficult time visiting Hannah for fear that with the fancy new lifestyle her best friend might not be the same person anymore! Add that she will be in the same room as famous people and she is kind of freaking out! She quickly realizes that Hannah is still the same person she grew up with and relaxes a little with the knowledge that her friendship is still intact but is still pretty intimated to meet all the new people in Hannah's life.Going out in Nashville and meeting all Hannah's new friends she quickly notices Nick; and after a steamy run in (which I will not ruin for you!!) she can't stop daydreaming about him! She just as quickly realizes that daydreaming is as far as anything will ever go because people like him just do not date people like her


So even with her strong attraction to Nick and the fact that they will run in the same group of friends she doesn't hesitate to jump into a relationship with Zeke! Because well he might not be as hot as Nick, he is the lead singer in a band and really who could blame her.What I liked in this story was the decision Molly faces; does she go with what feels comfortable for her or take a giant chance on something that she just doesn't see working out?So once again another steamy romance that will leave you wanting more!! I can't decide what I want for the next book in the series


At first I was thinking I really want a book with either Hannah's friend Taylor or famous country star Cam Bishop but now after meeting Molly's brother (Ben) I want to know his story also!! I am almost thinking a Cam, Taylor, Ben love triangle?!! But then who would I root for?! Ahh all the possibilities!! Can't wait for the next one!!For more reviews[...]

$REVIEW.: I've had this cookbook forever and I still refer to it.  I see that some people don't like the layout and design, but I do.  It might be a little dated but it's full of cute and quirky illustrations.  I definitely can see how the illustrations don't really add to the recipes the same way relevant photos would, but I smile when I read the recipe for Kiwi Salsa and next to it is a kiwi bird dipping its beak in a bowl of salsa.  Or the recipe for Chicken Broth with the illustration of a chicken taking a warm bath while reading a book.  It's fun.  If I could change one thing about the look, it would be to add actual photos along with the little illustrations.  Nothing compares to being able to see a photo of the finished dish.More importantly - the recipes.  As far as recipes go, there is just so much to try.  The Spicy Peanut Sauce is fantastic.  I make it all the time and use it when I make Chicken satay, for dipping spring rolls, tossing with noodles.  It's really velvety and full of punch.  And as far as the criticism of this being tailored to an American palate... From my experience, a lot of the recipes are *not* authentic, so I think people looking for truly authentic recipes will be disappointed.  For example, the coq au vin that someone raved about definitely is not a traditional recipe based on my own experience.  But that doesn't mean it's not good.  In general, the recipes are on the long side (more than 7-8 ingredients) and they do require some out-of-the-ordinary ingredients.  I tend to shop at Whole Foods and Trader Joe's, so I haven't had much problem finding everything.There's a lot of great tips throughout - little boxes with useful information like "How to Poach an Egg" or "How to Skin Fava Beans" or "Get to Know Soy Sauce" - lots of descriptions of spices or cooking techniques or just cultural tidbits such as a description of Indian markets.  It's a really fun book packed with great recipes and great extras.  And at almost 600 (!) pages, it's quite a value.

$review_text.: We were very, very excited to receive the latest two Imagination Stations books to review!  Book #8 is called Battle for Cannibal Island and Book #9 is Escape to the Hiding Place


 As with the rest of this growing set of books, we greatly enjoyed reading them!  They are very well written and a perfect length for young readers.I especially liked the theme of these two books

 I loved having the opportunity to introduce my boys to heroes of the Christian faith


 People who did all that they could to serve the Lord.Battle of Cannibal Island is about a missionary named James Calvert and his mission to teach the cannibals in Fiji about Jesus' love
 During this journey, Beth and Patrick not only learn about Calvert's mission, they also learn about giving freely and praying for your enemies
 My favorite quote from the book is something that James Calvert tells Beth and Patrick - "You'll do great things if you let our great God work through you


 Never be afraid to go where He leads."Anthony wrote a book report about Escape to the Hiding Place, so I thought I'd share it with you.Escape to the Hiding Place is an Imagination Station book, written by Marianne Hering and Marshal Younger


 This is a Christian fiction book


 There are 119 pages in this book and it is about World War 2.Patrick and Beth are the two main characters
 They are both 11 years old

 They are cousins

 They are both generous and helpful


 They normally stay together and rarely go apart
 Sometimes they are funny.The owner of the imagination Station lets them take a ride in it and they end up in World War 2
 When they are trying to find shelter a spy save them!  They thank the spy and he takes them to shelter


 When they get there, they listen to a hidden radio

 They figure out that kids can't be out past midnight, but they have to do that so they can give a baby back to her mother

 On their mission they meet a cop and he says if they get in trouble to say that they know him
 That comes in handy and they survive a bad situation

 Then they find the room where they are supposed to go to, but there are cops all around
 Will they survive and deliver the baby?  You'll have to read the book to find out.I recommend this book because it is a Christian book

 They are great books!  I love them!I received these books free of charge from Tyndale House in exchange for my honest review

 I was not required to give a positive review and all opinions expressed are my own.

 I wanted to go deeper with both of them.Paul is the oldest Reed brother

 The one that gave up any plans he may have had in order to raise his brothers

Friday is family by association

 She works in the Reed's tattoo shop
 There's the infamous Kiss, then...nothing
 Friday closed herself off for reasons unknown to Paul

 I thought the surrogacy storyline was interesting
 All things considered, it unsettled me

 I can't begin to posit the thought process one might have in a similar situation

 However, that choice had me puzzled.Friday's past was heartbreaking and not, at the same time

 Another issue that I didn't think received enough page time was the Kelly situation


 What a bitch


 She never got the (verbal) smack down that I thought she necessitated
 Every time a Kelly issue popped up, it kind of went away
 Something should have happened


 I was waiting for the confrontation that never occurred.A fantastic, solid installment of the Reed Brothers series, this story is full of heartbreak and healing.

Clever, inventive and laugh out loud funny


Really great Science Fiction


The 4th book is a disappointment and very tedious


It was written years after the first 3 and Rucker didn't get better


However, the first 3 are FABULOUS.

I would read all three of them again and may do so as soon as I forget what they're about, which will be too soon.  I do recommend it to others.

$review_text.: This book is a basic, plain vanilla guide to the more mainstream sex toys - mostly vibrators. It is done like a nice coffee table book, hard bound (no pun intended), with large photos on slick paper.The author covers vibrators and dildos quite well, along with lubrication and other basic toy topics, including basic anatomy and toy hygiene. If you are new to sex toys, this would not be a bad introduction. You won't find any really wild and on the edge sexual toys or practices here, but the information that is here is solid and useful.There is a small section on bondage and an even smaller section on BDSM toys which essentially only discusses basic floggers or riding crop type toys. Nothing more exotic is examined, which is probably to keep from scaring the newbie or those whose tastes do not run to such things.I struggled with giving this book only 3 stars, but the fact that Betty Dodson's work is mentioned, along with a great listing of solid resources for further exploration, made me push it up to 4 stars.Not an encyclopedia of sexual toys, but a good solid introduction to safe toy play. Recommended for those just starting out.

$review_text.: OVERVIEW: In The Real Win Colt McCoy and Matt Carter wrestle deeply and personally with the challenge to succeed in a world that seems to get in the way. They raise a lot of questions about this and then deliver down-to-earth, biblical answers. Based on their personal experiences and a close study of Scripture, McCoy and Carter show men: Why so much depends on who you trust and who you serve. Why every man is called to lead and why every man can. How to man up to temptation&#8212;and conquer it. How to find the &#34;win&#34; even in your biggest failure. The book now includes a bonus-section on mentoring, plus a small-group reading guide.AUTHORS: Colt McCoy is an NFL quarterback who, while at the University of Texas, led his team to the BCS national championship game and became the winningest quarterback in NCAA history. Colt is involved in ministries around the world. During the off-season, he and his wife, Rachel, live in Austin, Texas. Matt Carter is founding pastor of the eight-thousand-member Austin Stone Community Church. He is a champion for the For the City Network, which helps churches partner with social service agencies to meet local needs. Matt is the author of several books, and he speaks at conferences nationwide. He and his wife, Jennifer, have three children. Marcus Brotherton is the author or co-author of more than twenty-five books, including the New York Times bestseller We Who Are Alive and Remain. He lives with his family in Washington state.MY REVIEW: Best-selling author, Max Lucado said, &#34;Colt McCoy and Matt Carter lead men to win&#8212;not just in athletics or careers, but in life. This book is packed with inspiration and practical guidance. I heartily recommend it.&#34; And so do I.The Real Win will challenge and convict you. What I like best about it is that it will help you grow in your faith. It touches all the areas in which men struggle. It points the way to success by pointing to Jesus. Colt and Matt are not afraid to share their own struggles and failures. But they want you to look past your failures, their failures and look to Jesus Christ for your picture of success.This book will point you to the real win!

A suspenseful page turner with plenty of gore and tension, excellent character development and a point to the story. Sick and edgy and I couldn't put it down.

$review_text.: This is one of those stories that will break your heart...yet still help you piece it back together again with love, trust, and the best of intentions.  It's beautiful.  It's magical.  It's simple in storyline, but wrought with so much emotion and life lessons that one can't helped but be moved by this manuscript.We begin at a low point for John and his beloved wife.  They are both elderly, but she has succombed to the ill effects of time, forgetting her present as easily as her past, and leaving the future hanging in the balance.  When tragedy strikes, we are prepared and so it is with a certain bittersweetness that we accept it as a piece of the puzzle.  We get to know each of the lost souls returning in more ways than simply physical presence.  We get the chance to discover the depths to which a parent's love truly runs even when the words escape them.  We get to uncover the darkest secrets of many, the simple truths of a few, experience life through the eyes of someone that has truly lived and despite what time might say, has much more to share with us.John is a wonderful and caring narrator.  Through him we learn to love with all our hearts, trust with our full beings, and share a smile, a kind word even, with each person we meet, because we never really know when our last days will come.  Do you want to spend your "ever after" lost in regret, what ifs and shoulda wouldas?  Or would you rather be able to say...I LIVED.  After all, life may not always be perfect but it's those imperfections that make it a path worth following.  Share it with the ones you love....as it should be.**review copy received in exchange for my honest review....full post can be viewed on my site**

After a makeover Chastity and Sebastain start having a passion affair. But what seem long term to Sabastain is only a game to Chastity and sometimes in games of the heart people to get hurt."The Reinvention of Chastisty" is the second book that I have read by Eve Vaughn. It is a pretty decent book. I thought that it could be a little longer. And sometime I thougt that Chastity's wasn't a very nice person.

As the bits and pieces began to fall into place, the reasons I was so hooked on this book began to change as well. I loved the two main characters: Shay and Mason.

I think too much was packed into the story line. It felt like I was watching Machete. Drugs, bikers, booze, evil vs evil then a cowboy twist. It felt a little rushed and you start getting where the story is going and it twists again to another theme. I enjoyed the characters but wish the story was more specific.

$review_text.: Liz Curtis Higgs stands out as one of the most gifted writers that I have had the pleasure of reading. The Scottish historical series that opened with her acclaimed novel Thorn in My Heart ends just as brilliantly with Grace in Thine Eyes.Davina McKie is but a slip of a lass, whose childhood accident left her mute and her family divided by her father's resentment. When Davina is seventeen, her twin brothers are sent to Edinburgh to begin their schooling and she sets out to visit her cousins on the Island of Arran. There, the rumor of her uncanny talent on the fiddle spreads, and she invited to play before a Duke. Thrust unsuspecting into higher society, her innocence is quickly robbed but not her spirit. As she is forced to choose between resentment and forgiveness, her decisions propel an epic story of betrayal, love, and intrigue.Liz Curtis Higgs explores one of the most puzzling passages of scripture, fictionalizing the biblical story, and providing a woman's perspective--so well that she brought tears to my eyes. Backdrops that with an amazing talent at holding readers captive, descriptions that are poetry, and it becomes a classic. I anxiously await her new Scottish historical releasing in 2008--Highly Recommended

You've heard it all before. But have your implemented it? Courtney shares points and further reading to help you there.I particularly liked her "closet sorting" approach. It acknowledges we hold onto stuff, not because we need it, but because we like it or it has emotional value. An excellent reminder of what's important.

 It contains all the details you could ever want
 As it says on the cover, its based on satellite imagery, and contains a lot of physical detail such as the location of areas containing buildings which would be absent without this feature

 A really great map, and I'm packing it on my next trip to Tuscany.After my visit to Tuscany, I can say this map really does the job
 What I can suggest is that you also purchase some of the 1:25,000 maps which are available in the Tuscan bookshops which shows exact walking and driving information that you will need if you are driving or walking this country

$REVIEW.: THIS REVIEW ACTUALLY ENCOMPASSES BOOKS I, II AND III...SEE WHY BELOW.The Mountain and the City is a wonderful little surprise, brilliant in its simplicity.  It's a difficult-ish read until you get into the rhythm of the writing style and find out WHY it's written in such a way.It starts out in Book I with the loneliness, desparation, fear and isolation of the main character, and slowly throughout the story and in the continuations of Book II and Book III carries that forward as other "characters" are introduced.I haven't read many books like this, and though initially the character's voice is childlike and vague, we later find out that it's because the character was a child when the Event happened, and has lived alone in the trailer since then. A significant amount of time has passed, and the character has had no adult guidance to learn how to survive, and has learned instead by trial and error.I admit to being thoroughly surprised on several occasions as the story unfolds.  Won't say why, but you'll see for yourself when you read it.  :-)The reason I have not reviewed Book I alone is because I do not believe it should be Book I.  Each book in this story is way too short, novellas, really, and does not stand alone well.  I read all three of these books in a couple of hours last night. Each ends in a cliffhanger, not in a good way, just in an unfinished way.  If all three books were combined into one volume this would be a full and complete volume, and would work much better.That said, I am totally looking forward to Book IV so I can find out where the author plans to take the characters.

$review_text.: The Elegance of the Hedgehog By Muriel Barbery3 StarsThe Elegance of the Hedgehog is not something I would have ever questioned as a phrase and made no sense to me at all upon seeing the title of this book. Enter Renee', a fifty something concierge in a building full of rich employers. To them she is not worth their time or concern, always sitting in front of a TV sputtering worthless drivel, gaining more and more weight while being a rude uneducated individual. What you see or assume is not always what you get. Same can be true about Paloma, a 12 year old adolescent on the verge of teenhood. She is your average typical pre-teen who gets lost in the sea of like students. She also has decided to kill yourself on her 13th birthday because what is the point of going further?Renee' never steps foot in front of the driveling television. She spends time analyzing the rich and their lives while drinking tea with her cat Leo and reading major works of literature. Paloma goes through life doing what is expected of her, an act because she is far more complex then anyone can handle. Both are content to continue the ruse that is their lives until an unexpected event causes one Japanese man named Ozu to enter the scene and change their lives forever.I listened to the audio production of this. The narrators were well chosen and you felt the characters. The concierge had a course voice and Paloma oozed arrogance. I could feel like I was there with them. The book flowed well alternating between the concierge's story and Paloma's. They are separate people sharing the same world not realizing how much they are alike.The book caused me to think about life, assumptions, and the impact one can make. I questioned society and why we do the things we do as humans. I gave the book a 3 star rating not because I have any negative thoughts on it. I enjoyed it, and I'm glad I read it. It just was not the type of book to have me jumping up and down or overly impassioned. There is nothing wrong with that though, it served the purpose it was meant to serve.

$review_text.: This novel follows Jerry Battle, Americanized from Battaglia, his father's Italian name, for a few months in the year that he is turning sixty, consisting almost entirely of his ruminations concerning his life, past and present, and the larger world. Upon retirement from his Battle Brothers landscape company, turning the reins over to his son Jack, Jerry, on a whim, purchases a small plane after one flying lesson, which, upon being licensed, he often flies over the Long Island area, including his house on which he had shingled a giant "X." The pleasure that he derives is simply an extension from his lifelong disconnect from life's messier details and the distance that he has always placed between himself and others: the plane was "the little vessel I was looking for, my private box seat in the world and completely outside of it, too."Jerry has always been a reasonably pleasant fellow, not unaccommodating, yet not the strongest guy around: "I've been too willing to share my life's loads with loved ones, never having the stomach to endure anything alone." He has also worked hard, but not passionately. However, his reticence in life has not been without its consequences. His Korean wife Daisy drowns herself after a few years of marriage for vague reasons, though sheer enervating boredom would be relevant. His household, which includes his young daughter and son, Theresa and Jack, is saved only by the kindness of a Puerto-Rican housekeeper and soon to be lover Rita over the next twenty years. Inevitably, she becomes exasperated with Jerry and leaves him for a childhood acquaintance of Jerry's, now a very successful lawyer. The fact that a vague dissonance seems to follow Jerry is given weight when pretty, middle-aged blonde Kelly, an associate of Jerry's at the Parade travel agency, where he works part time, and an on-again-off-again lover, overdoses on Oxycontin.Jerry's summer of turning sixty becomes somewhat event overloaded, providing some semblance of a plot. His father Hank, ensconced in a retirement home, a place according to Hank where "the world's boredom and isolation is purified," has his moments of rebellion including disappearing for days. Theresa, taking a break from her critical studies professorship to visit with her new Asian husband and wannabe writer Paul, is pregnant and strangely subdued from her usual disputatiousness - she is hiding a serious illness. And his son's reckless efforts to greatly expand the landscape business in a down economy, not to mention the huge expense of his McMansion and extravagant lifestyle, are a calamity on the near horizon. The summer is painful for Jerry; but it is a time of halting adjustment and growth for him. As he understands, "that I cannot stay at altitude much longer, even though I have fuel to burn, that I cannot keep marking this middle distance."Ethnicity lies just beneath the surface in this story, yet curiously the author seems to go nowhere with it. His Asian son-in-law has an adverse physical reaction to drinking - that's about it. Perhaps, it is only an indicator of the changing nature of former lily-white suburbia; however, the book is not intended to be a thoroughgoing polemic on the nature of suburban life. Jerry's observations and the course of his life are not without interest, but the stream-of-consciousness approach results, in the case of this author, in very long, rambling, and shifting sentences - not always easy to follow. It is the keenness of subtle, embedded insights that capture one's attention and make the book worthwhile. Most of the characters remain sketchy in this thought-centered book, Rita being a tantalizing exception. Another curiosity about the book is that Jerry spends more time in his old Impala than he does flying.

$review_text.: So, Amazon ate my last review, wherein I made a lot of salient points about this very good book.  Unfortunately, here we are, and I will just make a couple of points about Bukkake Brawl.  While it would seem to land squarely in "bizarro" territory, it avoids the "peepeepoopoof@#ckyf@#cky" trap by making these tropes a logical extension of the classic Gibsonian cyberpunk.  It's existing in this classic cyberpunk dimension that is the strength of BB.  The flipside of this is also its weakness.  By exaggerating the sex and violence, we miss out on a lot of tantalizing details of the world Made In DNA has created.  I'd rather hear about the single-serving alcohol fuel cups than about tentacular penises or torn vaginas, because the heart of of this book is an economic crisis, beneath all the cyberpunk trappings, and I think a little more focus on this angle would have made it a much more universal story than Bizarro niche.  Overally, a great quick read.

$REVIEW.: This is one tome guaranteed to give you nightmares, but the kind of nightmares which can wake you with a start at 3:00am, your head throbbing, your chest wet with sweat - the illustrations by Dan Brawner are disturbing enough to wake you up at 2!Savage savages THe Political Barnyard but in a wonderfully sophisticated way; demonstrates that the yard is much wider and longer than one "political junkie" might imagine: Newt, Rush, and McCain roll in the slop right alongside Diane, Barbara, and George. MS calls their "Political Animal" zoological names and they do their dance, which provides instant recall to the onlooker, as their cunning, their attack, and also their awkward actions which are antithetical to their original mission statements, re graphically depicted.Interesting that Condolleeza Rice and Pat Roberson escape such displays; even Diane Feinstein, a Savage example of extreme Liberalism, makes it from one end of the penn to the other without getting too muddy.This isn't throw-away stand-up stuff: it's often hilarious...not tied to the times...something to make us consider how much "feed" we allow.

$review_text.: I got this book when it was offered free on Amazon and I have to say I was surprised by it. While it's a longish book I found it easy to get into and quick to read. Juliet and her sister Sarah go to Sarah's in laws house for some much needed qiet so that Juliet can get her writing mojo back.Little do they know the house next door is owned by a raucous movie star Romeo Boyd, and he arrives with his noisy friends and a couple of stereo type Hollywood chicks. That's when the fun begins. The first half of the book is hilarious, I loved the scene where Juliet goes over to confront Romeo over the noise and horrid way Sarah had been treat and Romeo thought she was the stripper! I cried laughing. I also really enjoyed the building love story and them falling in love (though not admitting it to themselves) I thought the wedding was hilarious.What I struggled with a little is that it did need some work with the grammar and I'm not to sure in this day and age that someone would leave a man they loved deeply to allow another woman who says she has a claim (not spoiling) on him and live with such heartbreak.But the story was quirky and cute and fun to read. If you like light hearted good humor this is the book for you

$REVIEW.: Lately I've been reading a CEO box set that I purchased and have had bad luck with the first two books.  This being the third book, I started this read with fairly low expectations.  This book taught me to not judge a book by the rest of it's box set!  Quickly into the book, I read a single point of dialogue that made me second guess my expectations.&#34;Please, the great Adam Lawrence does not apologize to anyone.  You'd have better luck parting the Red Sea using your lipstick.&#34;I just cracked up laughing.  There's many small gems of great humour spaced out in this book.  It was enough to make me laugh without making me feel like the book was overly cheesy from excess humour.  The humour, romance and conflict were delicately balanced to create a fantastic story between two stubborn main characters.The main aspect of this story that made it stand apart from many of the other CEO style romances that I've read is that the main heroine, Cassie, is a complete firecracker.  Every time the hero (Adam) gave her a hard time, she threw it right back at him in spades.  She is a strong and worthy adversary to Adam's sense of control in his life.Adam is a bitter man, scorned from his father.  Like many CEOs (at least in books), he doesn't believe in love.  Cassie melts his heart by challenging him to be a better man without outright trying to change him.  The change in him is gradual as his heart melts.The one part that I felt I was going to have problems with was handled so completely well by the author that instead I want to mention it as a fantastic Kudos to the author's writing.  Shortly after her surgery for endometriosis, Cassie goes with Adam to his beach home to scope it out for an event he was planning that Cassie would be catering and hosting with him.  This is where the first sexual encounter happens.  At first I found this really distressing.  She had just had surgery days before, there's not any medical way that anyone would be healed enough for intercourse, but the author did her research!  During their sensual moment, Cassie was overwhelmed with pain, effectively ending their tryst.This was a great read and it really gave me a renewed hope for the rest of the CEO box set that it's in.  It's a sweet and quick romance that would be a joy for any contemporary romance reader to devour.

$REVIEW.: I received a copy from the author.Thanks to the joys of Goodreads I came across Fireblood by Trisha Wolfe in the future releases section. I love a good fantasy/dystopian/assassin story and decided Fireblood sounded right up my street.I noticed Trisha had already released a short prequel novella introducing her characters and the citizens of Karm.Unveiled is a short but good intro into Fallon's world and I loved how the city/kingdom was a funny combination of a futuristic dystopia and fantasy medieval world.Newly trained teenage assassin, Fallon is given her first mission: to kill Xander. Things don't exactly go to plan and Fallon learns that pretty much everything she believed in is a lie.I'm really looking forward to the release of Fireblood and to see Fallon and Xander's story continue.4 Stars in my Sky!My fav non-spoilery quotes:*"Well, I could always ask you to show off your skills by attacking that tree."*"Yes, the ever-effective 'kiss your enemy to death' tactic," he says, a smile playing at his lips. "I have to admit, it's my preferable way to dies."

$REVIEW.: Angela is just out of a relationship with Rafe and feeling angry for what he put her through.  She is at home and hears a voice talking to her through the TV.  She isn't sure at first what to think about that but then all of a sudden Daryl shows up in her kitchen.  She is a bit freaked as to where Daryl came from and that he is now standing in her home.  He talks with her and explains that he is a demon and knows she is a Siren. He promises to help her seek the revenge she is looking for....but Daryl is a demon after all and....they don't do anything without something in return.  He finally convinces Angela to let him help her without having to give up her soul.  The two of them work together so Angela can explore what powers she does have and how she can control them.  Daryl teaches Angela that with her Siren's song she will be able to use it to get the revenge she needs against Rafe.  Even tho the story is basically dark with the idea of vengeance....I really enjoyed the relationship and dialogue between Angela and Daryl.  The author did a great job with the storyline and it was left off with a bit of a twist I didn't see coming.  But would you really expect a demon to be honest..LOL  This was a short little story but packed with everything needed to keep the reader entertained.  There could be so much more to Angela's story and hope to get to read more of her in the future.  If you want to read an entertaining short story you need to check out Angela's Siren Awakening!

$review_text.: I first read these books (now book) over 10 years ago.  They have remained among my favorite books.  The book is appealing to people young and old.  Ms Engdahl's writings have a way of staying with one always.This trilogy serves as a thought provoking journey through the relationship between society, religion, and science.  It starts out with one man challenging the foundation of his society, to him embracing it, and back to him challenging it yet again, but for a completely different and selfless reason.  Ms. Engdahl paints a wonderful picture of a futuristic and simultaneously primitive world whose advances and way pique the imagination.Ms. Engdahl throws a taste of her intergalactic society into the final installment, but no one recognizable from Enchantress from the Stars or The Far Side of Evil.

$review_text.: By: Ellie CampbellPublished By: Createspace Independent Publishing PlatformAge Recommended: AdultReviewed By: Arlena DeanRating: 4Book Blog For: NORReview:"Looking For LA LA" by Ellie Campbell was a good chick lit romantic read. It took me a moment to understand this 'British Humor' but soon it came together for me and I found myself laughing out loud. Who ever would have thought that a postcard would present such a problem for Cathy and her husband Declan. This is one novel that was a well written read with some very 'serious parts.' There seems to be lots of secrets and when I thought I may have had it figured out...I didn't! The characters were well developed and very captivating...only to keep you reading to see what was going to happen next. This stay a home mom was definitely funny, had many issues and lord could she make up things....wow and Cathy's friends were very interesting. What I found most interesting was the mystery it had in the story and the surprise at the end. Be ready for quite a juggle of things that will happen. If you are looking for a good entertainment novel you have come to the right place for "Looking For LA LA" will give it to you. Would I recommend? YES!

$review_text.: I'm a fan of Kindle freebies, but always check the reviews first - I may not be investing money, but in choosing to read a work, I'm investing my time.  Although some other reviewers mention that there's sexuality in the book, I was startled by the discrepancy between what reviewers describe and what was actually there.  Yes, a teenager is given an amulet that offers invisibility; what no one else has mentioned is that EVERY SINGLE TIME he puts it on he becomes a voyeur to some sort of sexual activity, most of which he actively seeks out.  (I'm sure some late-teenage boys would be interested by this notion, and would use such an amulet in exactly this way, but I still found it creepy.)  There's masturbation, lesbian experimentation, oral, anal, toys . . .  All of this superimposed on a rather overfamiliar story of a young man finding he's always loved the girl next door.  I found the collision of these two styles - extended "Penthouse" letter meets male Gidget - to be jarring.  And I kept waiting for even one other (more creative) use for such a gift to suggest itself to the hero, who's supposed to be of above-average intelligence, and to have some spiritual depth.  I'm not out to bash anyone's writing, or spoil any reader's enjoyment, but I wanted to present a more accurate sense of what to expect for other potential readers.

$REVIEW.: Radiologist and author Cuomo reports that 41-years and $90 billion dollars into the War on Cancer were still seeing over 1,500 deaths/day from it. (Some 260 nonprofits have spent another $2.2 billion.) Why? She believes is because we don't focus enough on prevention, the direction that would benefit us most. Existing research shows we can prevent half of all cancers with what we already know. Yet, the National Cancer Institute is spending $2.3 billion this year on research to understand and treat cancer, and just $232 million on prevention. Meanwhile, tobacco companies still spend over $10 billion/year on cigarette advertising. Obesity, poor diet, and lack of exercise account for 30% of cancers, but high-fructose corn syrup, cornstarch, etc. receive more federal subsidies than fruits and vegetables.Some of the most expensive new cancer drugs (eg. $100,000 for a single course) are hailed as 'lifesaving' breakthroughs, yet extend life by just weeks.The American Cancer Society set a goal in 1996 of reducing the incidence of cancer by 25% by 2015. A 2007 progress report found a decline of just 0.6%/year, far less than required to achieve that goal. The cancer death rate has undergone a slightly greater decline - about 1%/year since 1990, on target for a 23% reduction by 2015. Meanwhile, the costs of cancer treatment (estimated $125 billion in 2010) are projected to hit $207 billion by 2020.Part of the reason for under-emphasizing prevention is that prevention studies are slow and time-consuming.There are 100 - 200 types of cancer, and new ones are still being discovered. Cancer does not occur spontaneously - a healthy cell's genetic material must first be damaged or altered. Some mutations are inherited, but about 90% are caused by DNA damage during one's lifetime. Environmental and occupational exposures can contribute. Fortunately, our bodies have built-in repair systems, but these become weaker after age 65. Viruses are linked to an estimated 15% of cancers - especial liver, cervix, leukemia. Medical radiation is also a significant cause of cancers, especially CT scans and scans improperly conducted with excessive exposure.Most who have their cancer detected early are not helped - some cancerous cells progress no further, others are so aggressive they can't be stopped. We do need improved screening for breast cancer, as well as better tests for lung and ovarian cancers, and increased screening for colon cancer.Another need - improved data-sharing. A 2008 survey found only 1.5% of 3,049 participating acute care hospitals had comprehensive electronic medical records, and another 7.6% with such capability in at least one clinical unit. The 'really bad news' is that there is very little interoperability. The National Cancer Institute has a similar problem assimilating and analyzing nationwide data.We need more aggressive government action to ban BPA (plastic, can liners), perc (dry-cleaning solvent), and parabens (cosmetics, processed meats, some snacks, liquid dietary supplements). More education on the dangers of smoking and second-hand smoke, obesity (breast and colon cancers), transfats (heart disease, along with breast and prostate cancers), and red meat.Vitamin D is GOOD. Statins in cholesterol-reducing drugs cuts colorectal cancer.

$review_text.: "Lost Child", by Marianne White, is the story, actually, of two lost children.  A young boy and an infant girl are abandoned, and spend the rest of their childhood wondering why.  Their stories are intertwined, although the circumstances surrounding each life are as different as the centuries in which they were born.Adam Talbot was six when his mother mysteriously disappeared from his life.  When he turned 18, his father confided that he had received word from her soon after she vanished.  The documents and broken ring that he had kept for his son in a safety deposit box revealed that she was the victim of a wicked bishop's experiment in time travel.  The letter that she had written to Adam was on parchment that had been proven to be 600 years old, and the fingerprint on the seal did indeed bear out the authenticity of its sender.  The disapppointing part in this tale was the lack of detail surrounding this "bishop" and his evil scheme.  Readers are not ever given anything substantial about how Katherine had come to be a victim of such an outlandish plot.  Adam's reaction to the truth did not ring true.  Yes, he was astonished, but then he matter of factly went about with his own plan to join his mother in the 14th century.  After all, he wanted his questions answered.  Did she love him?  Was her disappearance completely against her will?  I mean, come on, didn't the time travel stuff seem a little bizarre to him?  Then to meet up with just the person who could help him get "back to the past", meet a girl who is tied to his mother and brothers, be captured by his mother and brothers, ... It just was too trite and pat for my taste.Ysabelle, the young girl who was (of course!) the daughter of royalty, and whisked away from the palace to save the king embarrassment, was just the person Adam met as soon as he arrived in 14th century England.  Her benefactor as an infant was directly tied to Adam's mother and her evil bishop.  But how?  Was he from the 21st century as well?  The reader is never told this, and if it was infered, I totally missed it.This was nothing more than a romance novel, complete with the fiesty and beautiful maiden who thinks she is a commoner.  The handsome and strong baron who falls in love with her despite her humble background, is no match for her strong will.  Of course there were the fights and the vows to never give him a moment of her time, and I just skimmed through those passages!Another thing that bothered me was the large amount of typgraphical errors in my copy, published by Publish America Baltimore.  There were grammatical mistakes, words left out, and typos more than I can count.  I don't know if these were author mistakes or editing mistakes, but it was noticeable and irritating.I cannot, in good faith, recommend this book.  I felt it to be a waste of my time.  I love time travel books, and have read several, most notably "The Time Traveler's Wife", "From Time to Time", and "The Mirror", but this does not come close to having the richness of detail, or the character development of these books.  I merely wanted to hurry and finish it, skipping pages at a time to come to the conclusion that I already knew was coming.Great disappointment.CJH

The author presents painless slow cooker techniques that are guaranteed to help the vegan newbie understand just how simple and delicious a vegan diet can actually be. Even as a relatively seasoned vegan, I learned new things about tempeh and seitan, and love the way the author embraces their nature and versatility. The vegetable bouillon cubes are pure genius! Cooks like me who live in warmer climates will love the recipes that usually require an oven &#8211; an appliance we don&#8217;t even think about turning on when its one-hundred degrees outside! This must-have cookbook will certainly become dog-eared in no time flat in my kitchen.

I highly recommend it to anyone who likes a great romance.  Though villainous, in the first two books, Kent makes a great transformation in more ways than one in The Restitution.  You can feel his frustration and pain when he is repeatedly rejected by Isabel...of course this makes the ending even better!!  There are also some surprises along the way, making this book a real page turner.  Christian romance at it's best!

$REVIEW.: Pesi Dinnerstein has written a memoir that enchants, engages, confounds, mesmerizes, amuses and charms the soul.How can one book be all these things?  Because Pesi Dinnerstein, through her writing, is all these things.Pesi is a woman in search of more than a way to declutter her life -- she is in search of peace, clarity and yes, her keys.Before the reader turns to Chapter 1, he or she is captured by a quote from Carl Jung:  "In all chaos there is a cosmos; in all disorder a secret order."Despite Pesi's constant search for order and lack of detritus (clutter) in her life, I believe that she had a secret order, a secret method for keeping her life, as she wants it, organized.Pesi has taken a slice of her life, her clutter, and to it she has added her soul's need for spirituality and serenity

 Thus, she engages us with a memoir that doesn't overwhelm with an entire life story.The writing in this memoir is captivating and humorous and filled with worthwhile quotes that leave the reader taking away something for tomorrow

 We each have our clutter, whether it fills the rooms of our homes, our minds, our cars, our relationships
 There is something that hinders us from moving on to that grand and organized life we've all dreamed of.Pesi is supported throughout her quest by well-meaning and loving friends, who attempt to aid her in arriving at a solution for her problem


 But Pesi's overriding love of trinkets, books, and thrift shops consistently nudges into the well planned solution and overthrows like a wild group of protesters.A writer wanting to do her best work is beset with a need to keep drafts upon drafts, not throwing away unnecessary mail items, and stacks and stacks of research.And her soul is another part of her clutter
 What has she done with God?  How can she address this?Pesi explains, "Trying to simplify can be really complicated." And this statement rang true with me the moment I read it
 Since retirement and attempting to simplify my life from one of working long days and into the evenings, I'm still finding it difficult to pull myself away from writing and computers to get to the everyday necessities of household chores and running errands.A journey worth taking with Pesi Dinnerstein, especially if you are a clutterer and a seeker!Sherrey Meyer[...]

$review_text.: This book combines the three books of Kingsbury's Forever Faithful series into one book. The three books delve into controversial issues and religious rights - bringing the issues home to touch our hearts.In "Waiting for Morning," we meet Hannah and her daughter Jenny, a family whose lives are torn apart by a drunk driver. Hannah must face her grief, learn to forgive, and learn to live after death has changed her life forever. Jenny learns that life can continue after great loss and that healing can come.In a "Moment of Weakness," we meet Jade and Tanner, childhood friends who are reconnected as young adults. Through a web of lies that tear the two friends apart again, Jade runs away to marry another man and Tanner begins his career fighting for religious freedoms in America. Years later, Jade and Tanner's paths cross yet again as Jade finds herself the victim in a custody battle of her son. Truth must prevail for Jade and Tanner to heal the wounds of the past and bring hope for the future.In "Halfway to Fovever," the characters of the first two novels must face the greatest struggles of lives. Hannah and Matt must face losing another child. Jade and Tanner must face an illness that could separate them forever. The friends must come together and trust the Father in heaven to be forever faithful to them despite the struggles that threaten to tear them apart.I LOVED reading this series because it deals with issues that we often face in our life and ties in current political issues (drunk driving and religious rights) to raise our awareness of how our lives can be so easily changed forever....and that we have a Friend who is Forever Faithful to be with us through the tough times in life. A must read!

This book has a chapter on all the major types of products you would need and is well-organized and indexed.It's kind of like a cross between Consumer Reports and your best friend.  I would read and highlight the products that had gotten good reviews and then I have to admit to carrying it around with me when I went out to shop for things.  Great advice on everything you will want to buy for your kiddo initially.They give good recommendations on everything from car seats to bedding to high chairs to babyproofing to diaper bags.  They rate items for quality and let you know if more money buys you a better product or not.  They also have a healthy perspective on the idea of what is "sufficient"!  They give good info on things you might want to pass up or that you really don't need (but that someone will be happy to sell you!)They go thru maternity stuff too, so buy it well before you have the little one!I have followed Denise and Alan Fields since they wrote their first Bridal Bargains books.  They have proceeded to document and provide excellent advice for all of life's major events (and purchases)!!!  They now have a Toddler Bargains book for toddler stuff.  AND Denise has co-authored Baby 411 with a pediatrician.  It's a fabulous book also for advice on baby care.I think they're on version 6 of this book, so make sure you have the latest one.  Can't recommend all their books enough!

$REVIEW.: Superbia is the best book I have read so far in 2012, and is my favorite among author Bernard Schaffer's ever expanding body of work. So, you can imagine my excitement when he announced plans to write a sequel, especially so soon afterward.Superbia 2 picks up right where the last one ended. Frank has accepted the torch passed down to him by Vic, and continues the fight for justice--the fight to do real police work--within a broken system overrun by corruption and pandering suck-ups. Unbeknownst to Frank, as the supporting cast begin to reveal their true colors, things are about to take a turn for the worse.Reviewing Superbia 2 is a great challenge for me. The first book was so good, and so near and dear to my heart, that I am likely letting it cast too big a shadow on its sequel. So, in fairness to this book, I must review it based upon its own merit.Bernard Schaffer, unsurprisingly, continues to grow as a writer. Superbia 2 is a beast, showcasing the advancement of Schaffer's technical writing prowess. The sentences are cleaner, the paragraphs are tighter, and there are absolutely no wasted words. Every bit of text is relevant to something or someone, and figuring out how it all fits together is part of the fun.Frank O'Ryan has evolved from the gun-shy officer he was introduced as. He now has the confidence he sorely lacked. He has shed the innocence that once guided his judgment. He is able to apply the lessons learned from the first book to become a better policeman. He drags the heavy weight of his cynicism on a chain as he ascends to the top of the mountain. In short, Frank has become Vic in almost every sense.Superbia 2 is a great story with many different plot elements being skillfully threaded into your mind like string through the eye of a needle. This is not just Frank's story. There is plenty else going on, and Schaffer should be commended for bringing Superbia's world to life in an intricate and believable fashion.However, I didn't come away from this book without a bit of criticism to offer. Superbia 2 feels incomplete somehow; like a shell of what was intended to be a much thicker story. Like it should be called "Superbia 2, Part One."I'm disappointed by the lack of a payoff to some of this book's richest storylines (Potter County in particular springs to mind). There are a lot of moving pieces here, yet the reader is provided with only minimal resolution. We see the captivating twists and turns plotted from the earliest chapters, but in the end, only Frank's story comes to a head.  I'm left feeling as though Schaffer planted all the seeds, but is waiting until Superbia 3 to harvest the crops.The original Superbia is still with me, tucked away some place safe within my mind. It made me laugh. It made me cry. It made me want to see good overcome evil. Superbia 2 didn't affect me the same way. It had Schaffer's trademark humor, but I never felt connected to it emotionally. Frank has heart, but the rest of the characters just go through the motions like robots, playing their part to advance the plot, but offering little else.Though life in Superbia has moved on without Vic Ajax, it's the reader who feels his absence more than the characters that knew him. The constant back-and-forth between Vic and Frank provided Superbia with moments of levity needed to offset the harsh reality of the work they performed. There's no one in Superbia 2 for Frank to develop a rapport with, which robbed the story of one of the original's greatest attributes.With all that said, the good still far outweighs the bad, and I sincerely hope that Schaffer finds time in his busy schedule to give us more Superbia in the near future. I'll be waiting at the bar, eager to buy Schaffer a Miller Lite. You know, the good stuff.

$review_text.: This is an important book for a number of reasons:1. It can be counted among that group of books that signaled that something has gone terribly wrong with the post-Vatican II renewal.  In 2006 we (thankfully) are finally seeing true reform. The seminaries are being reformed, the priesthood is being cleaned up, our Catholic Universities are being called to return to their roots, we have a new catechism and the faithful are finally being taught the faith, and many of the new churches and shrines being built are eschewing the modernist trends of the last 50 years and returning to design that is timeless and a faithful representation of the Faith. Indeed, we are seeing more and more Churches being restored (as opposed to renovated)- a sign that the changes imposed during the 70's and 80's were theologically and aesthetically wrong.  This book is important because it was possibly the first to tackle the issue head on and call a spade a spade . . . a sin a sin.2. From this work, and others like it, a movement has emerged of Church architects to defend and advance the Tradition of architecture. An organization was launched called the Instituted for Sacred Architecture ([...]) and it publishes a journal and highlights best practice and critiques poorly designed new church buildings. Another website grew out of the book: [...] - which too is about traditional sacred architecture.3. The word is getting out. The laity is no longer sitting back and doing what they are told by psudo-experts who toute themselves as authoritative interpreters of Vatican II and then dismantle the tabernacle, move the altar and form the pews in a circle around the "family meal". Thankfully, the lay person can now say STOP! And have the supporting evidence to defend what is beautiful and sacred.We are beginning to see the emergence of what Dr. Paul Vitz, PhD called a "Transmodernist" movement which is marked by a transcending of the modernist doctrines (which the Church has declared heresy) and recovering an authentic experience (and theology) of the Sacred.Mr. Rose's book is important because it has signaled the fall of the old regime and the restoration of the sacred in Architecture. This is an excellet book for learning why this happened and why it was wrong. It is a hopeful book because it points out the direction of where things are headed for the Church which is marked by the John Paul II Generation!Thank you Mr. Rose.PS: If you look at the negative Amazon reviews of this book, they claim Mr. Rose is biased. But if you look at their other reviews, you can quickly surmise who carries the bias. The reality is that a minority of people have invested their identity and professional ethos on the kinds of buildings Mr. Rose legitimately tears apart and exposes to the light of common sense. That is why you will read ugly posts that tear apart Mr. Rose and his book. If you can't win based on ideas, you have to attack the bearer of the ideas himself.

$REVIEW.: Saucy Jack was a maniac who wove his bloody way into our hearts and shocked imaginations.  He created banner line headlines found in the London papers driving the inhabitants into a paroxysm of fear.  Check out the multitude of books exposing the truth and now add the Work of Aiden James and Michelle Wright.  The book is The Judas Reflections: Murder in Whitechapel.  Judas Iscariot, Emmanuel Ortiz here, is enjoying the riches of the import business, never mind the side trade in opium.  What is lacking is the art of detection and the current case is Jack the Ripper.  Judas steps in and sinks up to his neck, confronting an old enemy which neither he nor Roderick Cooley want to face and yet it is true.  The maniacal killings are vicious and their enemy will prove unrelenting.Mixed with all the dark attractions of the Victorian era, the degradations of Whitechapel, the suspicions of the police themselves, the closely held secret of his immortality, and his own personal guilt, this story will not fail to give you a thrill of the hunt, the dangers of being an immortal, and always the need to move on when things get a little too complicated.  Aiden James and Michelle Wright weave you a tale designed to enthrall you with intrigue and the dangers of staying under the radar.  The human world would never accept their story.  Now is the time to download this book and get captured in the all encompassing world of Judas Iscariot in a previous time before we met him in America.

Reed flees to China and Shanghai, the dark and mysterious city where he meets the exotic and glamorous White Russian Varinka Savischna. Startled and captivated by her beauty, Reid unwillingly begins a descent into the underworld of blackmail, espionage, and intrigue. Reid manages to save Varinka from death, finds himself captured by a Chinese death squad, and then complicates his life by being involved in an assassination plot of a Japanese spy. The intrigue escalates when events, facts, and characters are not what and who they appear to be. Hubbard successfully manages to trick and treat the reader with a fast paced adventurous journey of many twists and turns.

I really liked the characters in this book, especially (of course) the sexy, billionaire  Elliott Becker. He is a charmer, full of himself, yet very sweet and vulnerable at the same time. Her heroine is a spitfire. Frankie Cardinale keeps him on his toes.Snippet:"Men narrowed their eyes in distrust because he was wearing a Stetson and arrived by chopper. Women ogled  openly because, well, he was wearing a Stetson and arrived by chopper."It was a fun, sexy and heartwarming story that helped me escape to a hot beach in southern Florida.

$REVIEW.: Nova and Quinton: No regrets is the third book in the Nova series by Jessica Sorensen. I'm not going to lie. This series is a hard one to read. I don't mean hard as in the writing itself. I'm talking about hard as in subject matter. I love real life, gritty stories so this series was right up my alley. Just be aware that it might not be for everyone.Breaking Nova (book 1) introduced us to Nova and Quinton. Nova is lost after discovering her boyfriend's body after his suicide, and Quinton is drowning in guilt after surviving a wreck that killed his cousin and his girlfriend. In Saving Quinton (book 2), Nova travels to Las Vegas determined to find and save the boy she met the summer before. What should you expect from book 3? A look at an addict's life after drugs and the struggle to live and love again.I know most of you read to escape just like I do. We all love those fairy tale romances and happy endings. A story that makes us want be that woman. Sometimes, however, I want a book that takes me out of my comfort zone. One that shoves real life down my throat and makes me appreciate what I've got. This is that book.Quinton is out of rehab, back home with his father in Seattle and clean. He's also far from being okay. He still suffers from unbearable guilt over the accident. That same guilt makes him refuse to move forward. He can't move on from Lexi and the promise he made her before she died. The only thing Quinton looks forward to is his nightly phone calls with Nova.Nova hasn't seen Quinton since he went to rehab. She's in Idaho, going to college and living with Tristan and Lea. Just as life seems to finally be going right, it all falls apart. Nova spends her free time practicing with her band, trying to keep Tristan on the clean and sober path, and talking to Quinton by phone. Between making sure her friends stay safe, keeping the band happy and worrying about those she couldn't help, Nova is about to reach her breaking point. She loves Quinton and is dying to be with him, but she knows he isn't ready.No Regrets is a story of two people who have survived but must learn to live and love again. It's a story of an addict trying to make it day by day and the girl who refuses to give up on him. It's a story of love, hope, and how far you will go for the ones you love.No Regrets gets a 4.5/5 Hookers from me.  Remember this is not a happy series, but by the end your heart will thank you!

$REVIEW.: "In The Spirit Of New Orleans" has all the cultural touchstones: Jazz, history, religion, food and drink, architecture, customs, people, and Mardi Gras
But yet this is vastly far from a  retread of a typical guide book

Through Debra Shriver's depth of feeling and understanding of her adopted city, its familiar themes become fresh, current, and relevant
Her writing is that of a wise and gifted storyteller
Even for those of us who know the stories of New Orleans, we are still drawn into how Shriver tells (writes) them

She is a beautiful wordsmith.The selection of photographs is glorious, and the information given in the book is super solid
 There are several fascinating glossaries, one devoted to Jazz terms, one devoted to Voodoo words, and one devoted to Mardi Gras words, and there is a list of festivals and dates


The Secret Gardens & Fine Addresses guide is perfect and extremely useful.As a local I love seeing books that tell the story of New Orleans with depth and understanding
I am proud to own In The Spirit Of New Orleans, and derive great pleasure from reading it
I will also be proud to give it as a gift to those who have never been to New Orleans, or to those who have visited - It is a perfect memento of their time here.

$REVIEW.: Chuck Black authors the Kingdom of Arretthrae Series.  Sir Rowan and the Camerian Conquest is one of the books in this series.  These books are fiction, full of allegory, and intriguing stories about ordinary people who are called to do extraordinary things for the Prince (Jesus).  The books in this series remind me of the works of John Bunyan.  They are imaginative and captivating.This story is about an orphan boy who grows up and is trained to fight in tournaments.  He becomes a prideful fighter, unable to be defeated and winning fame, wealth, and glory.  Through a series of events, Sir Rowan is left for dead, but through his suffering finds the Prince and His call on his life. He must take risks, face losses, and decide whom he will serve.  Through all of this, he finds his purpose and gains more than he ever had as a prized champion.There is so much more to this story than what I can say here, without giving the story away.  I am impressed with the way Chuck Black writes that even a Mom of three kids can relate to the things he says through the characters.One part of the story that stood out to me was this:"I'm sorry, My Lord," Rowan's voice quivered.  "The ache in my heart is too strong for me to be what you want me to be."The Prince gazed into his eyes with such deep compassion that Rowan did not want to turn away."Your grief is great, as is Mine for you," the warm voice said.  "The evil of Lucius has robbed the kingdom of so many noble men and women..."This book has plenty of language like this which easily draws me to thinking of how Jesus views us and how He loves us and His mission is worth fighting for.I love these books and encourage anyone to read them.  They are geared towards teenagers, but I enjoyed reading this book as well.  This is the second book in the series that I have read and this one was even better than the last.  Chuck Black has a wonderful way of drawing the reader in.  This story is filled with exciting events, a love story, and biblical themes strewn throughout.  There is even a study guide in the back for further reflection.  I hope to read more of this series soon and highly recommend you to as well!Disclosure: I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group (Blogging For Books) for review purposes only.

$review_text.: Blood Claim from the very beginning intrigued me. Though fairly short it was a great read and left me wanting. I am giving the book 4.5 stars. The reason it isn't receiving five stars is that it ended a little too abruptly. Yes, I love a cliffhanger and I am not too upset since I have the following books, but if I had bought this when it released, before the others came out I would have been a little disappointed to have to wait and find out. So really that isn't a bad thing. It just goes to show how good the first book was and that waiting wouldn't have been pleasant.Other than that the book was wonderful, and had its own uniqueness. I find that with the vampire/werewolf fad the stuff can sometimes be overdone, BUT Magen brought a unique perspective on the vampire race which I found quite exciting. The difference she brought let me, as a reader, know that she was able to use her own imagination and write a fantastic beginning to a series.The book is 154 pages in print and held a lot of story. I felt she introduced the main characters very well. I loved Sophia and Dante. They all felt real and that is a good thing. Though, they become an official couple without officially announcing it to the reader I found their relationship sweet.The setting was very detailed. Dante's home felt more real because the description. In the beginning when Sophia is scoping out the place I felt like I was there taking in all the scenery. I also am impressed with Magen's ability to write in first person. There were times when I felt like I was Sophia, which in itself is no small feat, believe me writing in first person POV isn't an easy task (for me anyways) and she did it beautifully.I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good vampire romance with a little twist. I do however think if you want to read this series, you get them all at once. That way you can just finish one and slip right into the next. Because you will not want to put it down and wait to see what comes next.

$review_text.: Milena Agus' enticing little novel was an award-winner in her native Italy, before going on to become a European best-seller. It has the magic, yearning, and bitter-sweetness of `the principal thing' that is its subject - Love.Most of the characters in the book are unnamed. The narrator, a young woman, tells the story of her grandmother, interspersed with recollections of her own mother and father, and her extended family. The grandmother was the despair of her parents - having no marriage prospects at the venerable age of thirty; having scandalized the villagers with her inappropriately passionate poetry to any young man who shows casual interest in her; and, in fact causing others to doubt her sanity. The parents gratefully accept the offer of marriage from an out-of-town widower who is taking shelter with them during the time of Nazi-occupied Italy.Grandmother, however, was not over-whelmed by the proposal. It is not marriage she seeks. What this wildly romantic woman craves is Love. She resigns herself to the inevitable as best as she can, coming to some terms of agreement with Grandfather. But her life is changed forever when she goes for a medical treatment at a spa, and meets a fellow convalescent - the Veteran.This slim novel raises a lot of weighty questions. How do we know it's Love if it doesn't match our concept of Love? If we don't know, will we miss it when it's staring us right in the face? Not recognizing it for what it is, are we to be engaged in a futile quest for what we already have? Or do we waste away longing for a mirage, when life is beckoning us with all its robustness?The book's surprising, revelatory conclusion clears existing doubts, but raises a host of new ones in the process. With its vivid characterization and lush, erotic style, it evokes la dolce vita that we've come to associate with Italy.

$review_text.: This well-laid out book covers the whole history of ancient Greek thought in a structured manner - not an easy task indeed, but the author has done a great job.It provides a comprehensive introduction into the development of Greek philosophy, with insightful explanation of famous myths and how they have permeated Greek thought throughout centuries. It explains in detail the main concepts treated by Greek philosophers, from One and the Many, Matter and Mind, the Problem of Truth, and various Ideas of Happiness. It puts you into a contemplative state of mind, and for me it was a pleasurable summer reading under the stars (the Pythagorean Idea of Cosmos is a particularly interesting section).This is an indispensable reference for ancient Greek thought, with detailed analysis of its main concepts and a very useful glossary. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in Greek philosophy and the ways it shaped the modern understanding of the world around us.

$review_text.: Are you open to change? Willing to explore new dimensions... then hold onto your hat's ladies and gents because this is going to be one bumpy and wild ride. It is hard to believe this one small volume can be so full of startling new perspectives ranging from alien visitations, Yes Virginia, folks from other worlds, to telepathic mothers talking to their daughters without speaking and being chided by their grandmothers for doing so, healings that doctors can't explain, to tribal wars with aliens from their recorded history. That is just the tip of the iceberg offered in these 11 "no holds barred"  personal writings of experiences by Native American people revealing true life stories and ancient tribal historical knowledge long kept hidden from non-native peoples.Interviews, personal experiences from indiginous peoples of North America, Mexico, and South America... now known as Mesoamerica, make up the explosive information contained within. These stories are accompanied by photographs of artifacts and contemporary artwork/handicrafts that illustrate foundational beliefs, tribal historical origins and the presence of alien visitations. Nancy Red Star, the author of "Star Ancestors", is one interesting woman; a daughter of the Cherokee, former professor at Bard College in Native American Studies, and a frequent guest on the History Channel's show, "Ancient Aliens".Nancy's publisher, Bear and Company, spared no expense with the quality of paper used to highlight the beautiful Native American artwork and various color photographs that fill this book with the rarest kind of beauty... Truth spoken bravely. As you read this you will begin to see how we have been brainwashed into believing Native people's were savages. Actually it is astounding to see how advanced they were in so many aspects of their lives. This book helps you to open your eyes and begin to see what human beings are capable of becoming... people that honor the land and all sentient beings, both seen and unseen. Here we are invited to explore a new world and join our hearts to something much larger then how we were taught to see the world. Are you are ready to take off the blinders and see the world clearly? This book can help, but be warned it might shake you awake. A rare and important book.

$review_text.: This is part two of a 3 book series, and should be read in order. It also is a cliffhanger.This book picks up right where book one left off.  We follow Alex as she leaves L.A. for a Mexican island. She is no longer living in the dark and under her mask.  She is embracing her new found womanhood and is trying to be a normal young lady.She meets new neighbors, but is still not trusting of everyone see meets.  There isn&#8217;t much more I can say, that won&#8217;t spoil the book.It&#8217;s such a great story and I can&#8217;t wait for the final installment.  I am hoping that someday Cassia releases it in one full book.

$review_text.: I loved the story, it captivates you from the  very beginning and does not let go, until the end and even then you want to know more. The emotions you experience, as you follow the journeys of Ryden Coulter and Carlee O'Shannon. As they struggle with themselves, their vunerabilities, as well as, the birth of a new relationship; that throughout the book, is learning what it means to to trust and love another person with your life, your heart, your soul and body. I like the fact that the author brought out the strenght of the military man and wolf in Ryden, as well as his weakness. Once he acknowledged Carlee as his mate you saw His strenght as a leader. She has brought a mystery to life and  I am eager to read the continuation of Ryden and Carlee's story as well as Jt and Lou's. I want to know more. That to me is what a excellent author does they captivate, enthrall and keep you coming back for more.

$REVIEW.: This series is not only funny and creative but it crosses so many lines


 It isn't strictly paranormal or romance or adventure
 It is all of those things

 The stories are little bites of the larger story that you can read pretty quickly
 The quick shots of of story have a comic book type feel

 It doesn't allow the reader to get too deep into the world without reading more than one of the stories at a time but each piece feels vivid as if you were watching a movie or reading a comic
 Josh is a great narrator who feels like many of us do- average and stuck


 But he ends up saving the world from destruction by a hell dimension, with a hot boyfriend and a protective yeti guard dog


 It's not such a bad existence really..


even with selling burritos to gross zombies and smelly werewolves chasing cars in the paring lot.

$REVIEW.: At first glance this book doesn't appear to be much more than a collection of snapshots of various websites. However, you quickly realize that the true value of this book is in its organization of topics and the way that it presents all the various web design choices and options. The six main sections of the book focus on different ways you may choose to design your site - by type (blog, personal, photography, etc.), by design style (retro, minimalist, photographic, etc.), theme (nature, clouds, extreme, etc.), color, elements (rays, crests, stripes, etc.), and structure (tabs, zoom in, modules, etc.). Each subsection introduces that particular design choice with a few meaningful paragraphs, and explains the rationale beyond what particular effects that sites might want to convey. As already mentioned, there are plenty of site snapshots and illustrations that give examples of how to implement particular design choices in practice. As the title of this book suggests, these are just ideas - you won't find much in-depth coverage of these design choices, and if you are looking for such material you might want to consult a different book. Each example in the book is accompanied with the URL of the particular site, so you can go ahead and explore it in a greater detail.The ideal audience for this book would be a web developer with limited resources and a smallish number of projects. If you are interested in building just one or two sites for personal use, then this book might be overkill, but even then you might enjoy learning about various design ideas out there. A more ambitious web developer working on bigger and more trafficked sites can also get a few good ideas from this book, but for them website optimization using various sophisticated statistical techniques would be the primary design strategy.The book is well designed, printed on a glossy paper, with nice-looking colorful website snapshots. Many of the snapshots are too small for any detailed inspection, but you can always go online and check them out directly.Overall, this is very nice and informative web-design book.

$REVIEW.: I was not familiar with Nick Redfern when I purchased his 2007 book "Memoirs of a Monster Hunter." It appears he's been traipsing across the world for years in search of Chupacabras, lake monsters, UFOs and Bigfoot. Sounds like a good gig, and if you possess a breezy writing style with humorous detail, one can make a living. He's published nine books on the paranormal and cryptozoology, his most famous beingThree Men Seeking Monsters: Six Weeks in Pursuit of Werewolves, Lake Monsters, Giant Cats, Ghostly Devil Dogs, and Ape-Men, which a movie company bought the rights to. I will not deny I love this stuff. Redfern, adorned in black by way of England, makes a unique, true-life variation of Fox Mulder while humming Sham 69 (If the Kids Are United: Very Best of Sham 69).The problem with "Memoirs of a Monster Hunter" is the same I have with those cable TV programs detailing histrionic teams in search of the supernatural. The majority of the footage is seen through hand-held night vision cameras. We hear eerie moans and sometimes a tree branch cracks, but not one moment of convincing evidence. Nothing is discovered and I've wasted an hour of my life suffering endless commercials about diet pills. Thankfully, there are no commercials in Redfern's journal, but the end result is the same."Memoirs of a Monster Hunter" covers a five-year period when the author met his future wife at a convention and relocated to her home state of Texas. From the arid panhandle to urban Dallas, Redfern investigates his new hood to find numerous Lone Star tales of hairy creatures and winged serpents. Like a modern-day Charles Kuralt (On the Road with Charles Kuralt: Set 1), who traveled the country documenting dreamy souls in their personal coves of paradise, Redfern's journey is the thing. I would have loved for him to bag a Chupacabra (Tracking the Chupacabra: The Vampire Beast in Fact, Fiction, and Folklore), and he flies to Puerto Rico to do just that. He also investigates ghost lights, feral wolf children and, of course, the abandoned military base of Roswell, New Mexico (The Real Men In Black: Evidence, Famous Cases, and True Stories of These Mysterious Men and their Connection to UFO Phenomena).I found it wildly amusing Redfern and wife relocate to an area of Dallas near my own residence next to White Rock Lake, an inner-city water source surrounded by historic, early 20th-century homes. I was familiar with the ghost of White Rock Lake, a fun tale retold annually in the local newspaper on Halloween. No one has really seen this ghost, a young woman soaking wet attempting to hitch a ride, but Redfern recounts the legend and finds old newspaper clippings of a possible source. He also uncovers legends of crashed UFOs, bike trail goat men and even a black-haired demon rising from the murky depths. I've lived here most of my life and have barely seen a possum, though recently read about a nude man who painted his body orange and posed as a statue. While I will not reveal too much on his discovery, let's just say it was due to protruding evidence.Anyway, after Redfern strolls White Rock Lake, he finds time to investigate the famous Lake Worth Monster near Fort Worth (The Lake Worth monster [of Greer Island, Ft. Worth, Texas]). There was a rash of sightings in 1969 where a large Bigfoot creature charged cars and even threw a tire at lusty souls necking in the dark. The mystery was taken seriously by area police, but never solved. Redfern and friends don hiking boots and crash through the brush to discover a small pyramid made of wood. Now, if I was to see such a structure, I would assume kids were building a fort on a bored Saturday afternoon. Redfern, who sees red-eyed serpents lounging on roof tiles, is convinced this is evidence the monster is stalking the area on moon-lit nights after four decades of silence.The most fascinating aspect of Redfern's "Memoirs of a Monster Hunter" is his detail on the growing industry of Ufology, television shows and conventions sprouting across the country. It's big business and Redfern is a dedicated panelist. Writers, photographers and directors of something called the Texas Gulf Coast Bigfoot Research Society meet regularly, akin to those kids fromThe Monster Squad [Blu-ray] in the treehouse. Sitting around a table while likely driving the wait staff nuts, they enjoy spirited drink and hearty dinner. Do they really believe this stuff, or is it necessary camaraderie between kindred souls terrified of the possibility of being trapped within windowless cubicles? What life is better lived -- sitting through Powerpoint presentations on stock strategy or searching for aliens in dusty hangars? Maybe they're on to something.

$review_text.: Some programming books go systematically through a great long list of features, but leave you wondering how you would actually use half of it, and what really matters in that mystical land we inhabit called the "real world". Other programming books have really pratical tutorials and examples, but lack the breadth of language coverage and so they leave you with big holes in your knowledge (and those book are also no good as references).I think the reason this book is the best rated C# book is because it manages to blend astonishing depth of insight with comprehensive language coverage, and that is a rare feat. Also, you can download the PDF of the book for free, and it has nice colour highlights and is overall a very high quality PDF. Since this is such a practical book (every code sample runs directly in Skeet's freely downloadable compiler Snippy) I greatly enjoy having the PDF up for code cutting and text searching. Also, the book is written in a funny, laid back style that makes you feel right at home. This is a very rare programming text!If you are looking for a book that focuses on the .NET framework (the CLI, WPF, Entity Framework, ADO etc. etc.) then do not buy this book. It is entirely about C# language features (I think the Wrox book "Professional C# 4.0 and .NET 4" would be the best general overview for that kind of thing). If you are totally new to C#, then this is not the place to start, either - it is for people who are already up and running, at least in C# 1.0. SO, if you are a competent programmer and want to know C# in Depth, then 'C# in Depth' is definitely the book to get.Skeet knows the specification and IL back to front, but he also knows real world programming and the challenges and pitfalls that programmers face day to day (he's a bit of a legend on Stack Overflow, and he currently works at Google). This uniquely places him to overview all the latest greatest features of C# (like LINQ, code contracts, dynamic types and lambda expressions), to do so accurately, and to point out how things are used in production code - the role they play in the bigger picture. I just can't emphasise enough how good a job Skeet does in taking us from minute details of the JIT compiler to all the way to real world problems and practical coding solutions. It's really a delight to read and very informative, and he comprehensively covers the major new features of C# 2, 3 and 4 - keeping each edition seperate as much as possible (very useful if you are working on a project that targets certain versions of .NET).This book is by no means perfect - he does ramble on a bit in chapter 7 (which contains some pretty useless stuff, BTW), he sometimes assumes a bit too much pre-knowledge (like WinForms and expertise with the 'using' block structure), and sometimes the jokes fall flat... but these really are minor criticisms that don't even come close to detracting from this book's status as a bona-fide 5 star programming book. I had a growing appreciation of C# as a truly remarkable language before reading this book (I am fortunate to be working on a project that uses C# to its full potential) but Skeet's passion for the topic is truly infectious.

$REVIEW.: The book is about creating a world for your readers that's believable and enjoyable. Thom also strongly advises getting off your butt (away from the computer and google)and doing some real world research.I notice that some critics expected an A-B-C how-to-write book.  They totally missed Mr. Thom's ongoing advice, such as going beyond cliche descriptions used by lazy writers, and apparently also missed the great examples he provided.Some complained about Mr. Thom's anecdotal style about his own work and life. I haven't read a writing book yet that didn't refer to other work, including some that assumed we were all lifelong Star Wars or Harry Potter fans and were familiar with every excruciating detail in the series. Instead, I found Mr. Thom to be a natural teacher with amazing real-life credentials, which perhaps accounts for some of his ego. Thom's writing achievements are indeed laudable because he had to do research the oldfashioned way (wow, actually visiting a real place for accuracy or a setting instead of pulling a photo from the internet), and has lived long enough to offer some sage, experienced advice.Reading this book is like sitting down to talk to a wise, funny uncle about the Work involved to write a really great book. Work, not how-to ABC.My only quibble, as someone else mentioned: the chapter written by his wife, which was supposed to be about genealogy research,wound up VERY angry and political regarding Native Americans and phony white people. Sorry, I'm tired of angry people and bought this to learn, not to be shouted at. Otherwise, I enjoyed it.

$REVIEW.: "Come & Get It" by Kiera Cole, according to its foreword, is a reprint of a book previously titled under a different pen name.  I'd be interested in knowing if there are any differences, but I'm not vested enough in the story to bother.  "Come & Get It" is novella length story about a country girl and a city boy.  Dixie Rose lost her husband in Iraq and started a lunch truck business for construction crews... where she yells out, "Come & Get It!" (also the name of her business).  Quin is a slick city boy from LA who is used to the high life and has some culture shock while in Texas for consulting business at the construction company site.I received a copy of this book for review in exchange for an HONEST review.  I found the basic story concept to be enjoyable; I just wasn't sure if the author was planning to write a sweet romance story or a hot erotic story.  It actually made me so confused that I found myself thinking Quin was pretty crude and thinking that Dixie's stance on Southern morality was a bit two-faced.  I also thought it ended rather abruptly.Good thing is that this is a quick, easy read -- I got through it on my Kindle in about 45 minutes.  It would be good to throw into the bag to take to the pool to read.  What I didn't like about the book?  I think it would have been more enjoyable if the romance had been focused on, versus trying to throw in erotic content.  Give it a read -- see what YOU think & let me know!

 The illustrations are beautiful and the text is brilliant
 The author does the best job I've ever seen describing these concepts succinctly and eloquently


 The author covers different natural habits and introduces concepts in each


 She adds in habitats for people and the idea of domestication and extinction, but it's not done in an overbearing, "the world is over" way
 Even better, the book ends with acknowledging the work environmentalists do to preserve habitats in many ways, not just scientific ones (e.g., singing songs, organizing friends, giving money, etc.)

 Finally, the last two pages have activities, suggested math activities, games, and websites
 Wow!  This book is a WINNER

 I'd put the audience for this book at 4-8 years.

Gabriel does not even realize he wants to be with her until after he claims her in front of the clan on accident. I am not sure if she should be offended or not!?! He tries to fight it repeatedly and it does get aggravating to see her being the only one who is in it for the long haul. I wish the story was better but it is okay how it is at the moment.

$REVIEW.: An entire romance, engagement, and marriage take place over the course of just a few weeks.  So, if you like a whirlwind kind of book, then this will be the one for you.  "Chef Charming" is an equally quick read to go along with the storyline, so you can breeze right through the pages.  I also appreciate the Kindle version having real pages for this book.  It was pleasant enough if you plan on enjoying a night or two reading a Christian fiction book about love, relationships, and with a little food thrown into the mix. At the current price of $2.99, go ahead, indulge your taste buds.

$REVIEW.: I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie and I'm glad I did.  Although the movie was good, the book was much more dramatic.  At first the language was difficult to understand and read but within the first 2 or 3 chapters  I was able to understand the flow and rhythm of the author.

$REVIEW.: I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I read tons of Zombie and Post-Apocalyptic fiction, and was way more than pleasantly surprised. Originally written in Spanish, the translation is very very good. I read it in one day, glued to my tablet. Believable, with an awesome villain, and just a great overall concept. TOTALLY worth the money. The ONLY bad thing I can say about it is that there is a sequel, and apparently no plans to translate it and offer it through Permuted Press (Love those guys!) because sales were poor. There is NO REASON this book shouldn't be in the top 20 of Zombie Fiction. Maybe even in the top 10. BRING THE SEQUEL TO ENGLISH SPEAKING AUDIENCES! PLEASE! Buy it, you'll dig it, or you can feel free to chew me out.

$review_text.: This is my third Kaylea Cross novel. I first read Ignited, which is great, then Tactical Strike-- great once you get past  the first third -- and then Deadly Descent. This is opposite the order in which Cross wrote them.The entire first half of Deadly Descent is repetitive obsessing. What does he really think of me? I'm attracted to him, but it would be wrong. I want her so bad. And on and on and on.In the second half, the pacing picks up and the suspense is pretty good, but the story is almost exactly the same as Tactical Strike (and is the prequel to it), which is a better book. There's only one short sexual interlude and, by the end, I still don't care much about the H/h. IMO, skip it and read the two I mentioned earlier. I look forward to Cross's future novels, because she appears to be mastering the genre.

$REVIEW.: I received a copy of Finding Home in exchange for an honest review.Sam is about to graduate college and she has sworn off men and relationships thanks to what she's experienced with her own parents and with her dating history. Every one of her boyfriends has cheated on her and made her feel inadequate. She is busy planning for her future, which includes a teaching job in Boston, using her new college degree and finding a new place to live.Sam Cole's best friend and roommate, Jenny, is heading back home to California to work at her family's winery. When Sam's teaching job falls through due to budget cuts, Jenny makes Sam an offer that she can't refuse - joining her in California and helping out the family business while she figures out where to go from there.Jenny Foster's brother Ben has been grieving for the past 2 years, over the loss of his fiancee Beth who was killed in a car accident and is afraid to let himself have feelings for anyone else. Sam and Ben have spoken on the phone a few times, when he's called to speak to his sister and she was out but have never met face to face, until he picks Sam up at the airport as a favor to his sister. They both feel a connection but is that connection strong enough to break through the walls that each has put up around their hearts?I absolutely loved this book. Aine Kelley did an amazing job with this, her debut novel. I love that she offers us both point of views, with the chapters alternating from Sam's point of view in one chapter, to Ben's in the next. I always enjoy being to get into both main character's heads to know what they are thinking. Sam and Ben were such likeable characters - both had been dealt a tough hand by their own circumstances and both had very strong fight or flight instincts and I so wanted them to figure out that what they could offer to each other was worth fighting for.Aine Kelley's next book keeps us with the Foster family, featuring Jenny and Ben's best friend Jack and is due out in the spring of 2014 and I for one, cannot wait for it!

$REVIEW.: The artwork is entirely too twee for my taste, but if you like this kind of thing, this could be your deck. Be aware, though, that the imagery is also somewhat busy, crowded and "Tarot-y". It's a departure from the Lenormand idea of each card having a single, "pure" symbol and a playing card inset (which is missing). It can be a nice change for some, but for a person just learning, I'd recommend a more traditional deck.Other than that it's a fun deck and a lot of people are very happy with it.

$REVIEW.: Usually, my one-star reviews are really long and detailed, but with Til Death, I don't have much to say. This book just never held my interest, so I'd forget most of what I read as soon as I sat it down. There's nothing new here and nothing that grabbed me and made me want to keep reading.Til Death started off badly for me as soon as the narration alternated between third and first person. I hate this narrative style. It takes me forever to settle in, if I ever do, and with this I never did. I am just not meant to read books narrated this way, since I'm pulled out of the story at every POV switch. Short chapters meant lots of switching.The world building was lacking. We're given terms for things, but no explanation. What the heck is an Illumenari? What about the different branches: Legacy, Counsel, Mercenary, Seer, etc? I have no clue! Well, Seers can see the future, but that's about it. The plot also doesn't kick in until the end. Dillan was sent to investigate dead dogs, but that's barely mentioned since he spends most of his time brooding and scowling at Selena. Selena is wanted by some evil person known as Maestro. Why? I don't know.Til Death was just boring. Nothing happens, and when something does happen, I don't care because I haven't been given a reason to care. And I didn't even know what was suppose to be going on, since nothing is explained that well. The romance is the typical new, broody guy and the beautiful, special girl who thinks she's ugly. They hate each other but make out anyway because of some cosmic connection....and yeah. That's basically it.*Disclaimer: I received this book from the publisher through NetGalley for review. No compensation was offered or accepted.

I would suggest that you begin with the first in the Rockland Series. I didn't,I began with the first of the Past Forward books. I became addicted!  I  loved Willow and Chad  from the first page.  So much so that I went to the beginning of Rockland Series and have read each one of them. They involve romance,mystery,humor and morality. I have just reread the Past Forward Series for the fourth time.

 The author did give some thought in putting this book together and he did a pretty good job

 Even if you don't fall into the &#34;prepper&#34; category there are useful weapons described if you happen to get caught in a spot without a traditional weapon to protect you and yours

Not until Court walks to her door and says he is here to help a woman in need.These two go back and forth and at one point, I wanted to slap them both and wake them the hell up as to what is right in front of them... each other.

Before long, I found myself in hysterics - and had to go back and re-read to make sure I was SUPPOSED to be laughing.  What an astonishing sense of humor for a main character!  Not what I expected to find in this novel - truly, I expected a much darker, grittier novel.

$review_text.: Nearly everything that humans deal with is a system, which by definition is a structure with many parts that are interconnected in many different ways. One, but by no means the only mistake that can be made is to fail to recognize that something is a part of a system. If that mistake is made, then what happens can be unexpected and completely out of proportion. A change in some parts of a system is damped out so that even a major change in the part will have little overall affect on the system. In other parts, a small change is magnified all out of proportion and can even lead to the near or complete collapse of the entire system. Some examples of this are introducing new species into an ecological niche where there is nothing in that ecosystem to damp out their growth.A second mistake that can be made is to recognize that something is a part of a system but completely failing to understand what affect a change in it will have. Once again, there are many examples of this from ecology, where the introduction of new species had unexpected consequences. Another mistake is to understand what effect a "small" change will make but to have no idea where the effective limit is. The best example of this is the recent economic stimulus package that was implemented in the United States. There is no dispute that any federal money spent will stimulate the economy, the question to be debated is where is the ideal point where the stimulus crosses over into inflationary.Within all of this uncertainty the only hope is to do as the book title orders. Every decision about what to do should be made from the mindset of the structure being a system. Each action should be analyzed as something that could potentially do great harm or perhaps relatively nothing at all. Meadows is clearly someone that has thought long and deeply about systems and their structure. The physics dictum "that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction" simply does not hold in complex systems a point that Meadows makes over and over again and very well each time.Simple-minded thinking seems to be the norm in American political life, where you hear simple slogans repeated until your mind rebels at the foolishness. This mindset is repeated in other organizations as well, which seems to manifest itself as a major business failure once a decade. If more of the people in positions of power and influence were to read this book and take it seriously, then the debate over what to do would be more logical and lead to better and sustainable decisions.

$REVIEW.: This book had me feeling all kinds of emotions for Giselle

This book is the true definition when something seems to good to be true it probably is


Gio seemed like the perfect man for Giselle but when all of his secrets come out what will it cost Giselle

Giselle was young and naive when she got with Gio
Gio is not the squeaky clean upstanding guy he appears to be


I would recommend this book

It was well written and flowed nicely
The ending was okay but it was still a good story.

I also finished reading A shade of a Vampire, all 5 books, and Angel Fall by Ee Susan, as well as the sequel World After.  Sometimes you read a book from an author that you've never heard before, expect little, then you're presently surprised and haphazardly give a 5 star rating.  Not the case especially compared to the last several wonderful books i just in the last 2-3 months.Great story.....

$REVIEW.: This book by Christopher Vogler is a map to story telling

 Like any map, it can decorate your library--or you can use it as a map
 Maps are not something to glance through one time
 Maps guide you on your journey

 In "Trust the Path" Mr

Vogler relates a real-life event when he was in grave personal danger--he got lost hiking on a well-marked trail in Big Sur

 Any outdoorsman will tell you how quickly the weather can change from nice to life threatening.But this book is rightly titled 'The Writer's Journey.'  Vogler explains the map symbols of the story telling process in detail, and then reviews that modern literature, the motion picture, by examining these way-points on more than 100 movies ranging from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz to Titanic
 Literature in the old days used to refer to speeches and stage plays--only after the movable type printing press and wide-spread literacy were printed books added to the mix


 Now movies, the modern stage play, are back again--so the addition of movie analysis is a bonus to any story teller.But it is not just the story teller who will benefit from reading The Writer's Journey


 Myth has more truth than news, history or statistics

 Anybody who applies psychology, everybody involved in politics needs to know where concepts of hero and villian originated
 Contrast of 'The Ordinary World' and 'The Call to Adventure' are two way-points frequently used when selling others a product or service--or a political agenda

 Reading this book gave me greater insight into the recent political campaigns that I was lacking before.

$REVIEW.: this is NOT an alternate telling of that ridiculous musical movie starring Rick Moranis!Now that we clear this up, I find 'Pet Shop of Horrors' to be enjoyable, though this is not what I expected. When I read through this, I expected this to be what everyone is saying is the 'Tales From The Crypt' of Japanese Manga, but in Tales From The Crypt, it deals with a creepy, skeletal storyteller telling scary stories. I think of PSOH as the 'Fantasy Island' of Japanese Manga.  The way the episodes progresses, the store manager having an important role is some parts, the climaxes, IMO the whole concept of PSOH resembles that of Fantasy Island.  Watch the T.V. series and you'll see what I mean.Nonetheless, I find the stories in PSOH well written.  Each story in this book are well balanced, so one doesn't feel shorter or longer than the others.  The 'exotic' pets that were given to customers can actually change their lives to how they think of things whether those customers follow the rules given by the manager or not, and I think that kind of twisting concept is what makes this Manga shine.  Because this is story-driven, however, there really minor horror in PSOH.The art in PSOH is...well, Shoujo-ish.  Don't get me wrong, I find the art design well rounded.  The characters and environments look beautiful, the 'pets' look very imaginative, it's just...too...Shoujo-like.Anyway, PSOH is a wonderful Manga that may be too dialogued for its own good.  Anyone expecting a gorefest in this Manga might be disappointed, but for anyone else, don't hesitate to pick this up as well as its future volumes.  I know I'm waiting for the next volume!

$REVIEW.: I am a very biased reader when it comes to Jeffrey Gitomer's works.  He is the greatest.  I really like his style of writing.  It is as if he is sitting across the table from with and we are sharing a cup of coffee and he is sharing his wisdom regarding sales and personal relationships.  This book is no different.  It is a "how to" book that clearly sets out a plan for you to work on and develop to take advantage of the market as it is not necessarily as you may want it to be.  If you follow his guidance in this book, truly follow it, you can very easily see what you may not be doing now but should be doing in order to make the kind of sales you desire to make and then some!  If you are in management, this book would be a fabulous gift to your staff.  If you are a parent, no son and/or daughter should be without this book.  In my opinion, it would be a great companion book to Gitomer's book, "The Little Gold Book of YES!Attitude" which I have read numerous times.  After all, it IS all about ATTITUDE, either good or bad but given you have a choice, a good attitude works every time.

$REVIEW.: First of all, this is a beautiful book.  The pictures of the different exercises are fabulous.  I love that is shows you the correct form and is sectioned off in target areas, such as abs, lower body, and upper body.  It has modifications and has variations at four different levels of fitness: beginning, intermediate, advanced and super advanced.  Each workout is supposed to be 20 minutes.The introduction talks plainly and down to earth about the realities of spot toning and what can and cannot be accomplished (ie. can't have flat abs unless you do cardio to lose the fat sitting on top of those abs!)  She also talks about how "skinny starts in the kitchen" and how your serving sizes are probably way too big.  She recommends paying yourself for completing workouts as an incentive.  This section also mentions the equipment you will need for this book: an anti-burst stability ball; a pair of 5 pound ankle weights;resistance bands; a pair of 3 pound balls, and various dumbbells.  She uses a step aerobics platform in there which is not on the list. (I would also recommend a mat for the floor.)Basics of the plan are: 3 days a week on a targeted areas for 2-4 weeks and 50 minutes of cardio 4 days a week.  The cardio she recommends in listed at the beginning of each section. It seems to be geared toward a treadmill, but she says you can do these things outdoors also.The problems I found: The cardio is not for beginners.  It has a warm up at 3.8-4.0 on the treadmill.  Now I was 350lbs and I could not even go 3.0 when I first started getting in shape!  100lbs later I am sweating at 3.8 mph.  It even has running.  If you out of shape don't do this just because it says to...be smart.  I wish she had said something about this but she didn't.  Also, 50 minutes may be a lot for some newbies.Second major problem I found was there seems to be only targeting one area at a time then you ditch that newly toned area and focus exclusively on a different area.  What about maintaining what you have worked so hard for?  I wanted to see her have a section where the different areas are combined to make a complete, total body workout: abs, lower and upper together.Bottom line:  this is a great REFERENCE book for how to do all these different exercises.  Don't use it for anything more than that.  The pictures alone make this worth the money, however I am only giving it 3 stars because it could be so much more!!

$review_text.: The third installment of Ann Lister&#8217;s The Rock Gods Series focuses on Ivory Towers&#8217; drummer, Cooper Rand. At the end of book two, Take What You Want, readers are given a glimpse of what&#8217;s to come between Cooper and Jayson Keller, Chase and Danni&#8217;s best friend, but let me tell you, experiencing it fully in Make You Mine is so much better! This is an amazing love story between two men who have never experienced more than simple hook ups, never looking for more than that because the concept of love was one they never felt fit them until they literally bumped into one another and their attraction sizzled.What I love most about Coop and Jay&#8217;s story is that readers are with them from the very start of their relationship. At the beginning, they both try to downplay their feelings for one another and simply see their time together as nothing more than sex, but all it takes is their hands intertwining during a moment of passion to show both of them that what they feel for each other is so much more, and even though both are hesitant to say anything out loud, it&#8217;s clear as day to readers that what they&#8217;ve started will continue to grow.As the story progresses, Ann Lister does a great job of showing the complications that can occur in a bicoastal and societal judged relationship as well as the strength that is required to make it work despite all that is going against it. The way Cooper and Jayson learn how to communicate with each other and be honest with their feelings is what allows them to overcome all that they are faced with, and because readers are given both of their point of views throughout their journey, we witness their love blossom and grow into the forever kind. The sex that begins it all is still a huge part of their relationship, and Lister shows just how much they truly connect as a couple with those steamy scenes, but she also proves what they are to each other based on the ways they support and care for one another as well. Another aspect of the text that really works for me is the personal growth both Coop and Jay demonstrate, which in my opinion, truly illustrates what someone is willing to do for the right person.Make You Mine is a testament to the idea that love is love; it&#8217;s not about gender or race or even the number of partners in the relationship. It&#8217;s about trust, communication, and commitment and Ann Lister does a fantastic job of weaving that message throughout all of her stories, but it resonates the most in Coop and Jay&#8217;s story due to the bigotry they face. I&#8217;ve only read a few books in the M/M genre, but if there are more like Ann Lister&#8217;s books, it will quickly become one of my favorites.A complimentary copy of the text was provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.4.5 poison apples (The Fairest of All Book Reviews)

$review_text.: I am an aspiring video game/special effects/creature character design student and am I glad I purchased this book

The content is unbelievably inspirational as it explains how Stan Winston came to become one of the, if not "thee" greatest special effects pioneer/master ever


It reveals Stan's mentality of curiousity and desire to push creative bounderies, and how he went from award winning make-up artist to puppetry, taking from Jim Henson's muppet wizardry to another level by creating realistic and monster "puppets" for movies, to todays CGI


In the book Winston explains his thought process and problems and solutions for many of my favorite movies as well as steps in designing/creating many of my favorite movie creatures like The Thing, Alien, Terminator, Predator and countless more
The pictures are spectacular and there are many of them including behind the scene pics, various awesome artist Art & paintings & Character/Creature designs from Crash McCreery and Aaron Sims

Basically the book is a:-Winston biography.-History of Special Effects.-"The Art of the Film" for a sh*tload of top movies.-Behind the scenes pics and personal stories for a sh*tload of top movies.-An incredibly interesting motivating & captivating read.All of this for $[...] (which I paid thru Amazon) is a complete steal and definitely a must have if you aspire to study or simply enjoy the special effects process.

$REVIEW.: "I'd estimate that 90 percent of Christian men lead lukewarm, stagnant, defeated lives... And they hate it.""No man should have to settle for half alive. You can become the man God created you to be. I'll show you how (Patrick Morley)."These are the words of the author from the back cover of his book, Man Alive, Transforming Your 7 Primal needs Into a Powerful Spiritual Life.Man Alive is built around the premise of man having seven primal needs. The author gives us a listing of them as:1. To feel like you don't have to do life alone2. To believe that God loves and cares about you personally3. To understand how your life has a purpose, that your life isn't random4. To break free from the destructive behaviors that keep dragging you down5. To satisfy your soul's thirst for transcendence, awe, and communion6. To love and be loved without reservation7. To make a contribution and leave the world a better placeEach chapter of the book is devoted to dealing with one need. The book digs deep into the heart to address these needs. The how-to answers are provided through an abundance of stories and real-life examples.My introduction to the writing of Patrick Morley came when I picked up a copy of his book Man In the Mirror. His passion for men's ministry poured from every word of the book. Man Alive resounds in the same easy-to-read style and the author's passion for men flows freely throughout.I must look intently at the primal needs this book addresses because each one of them applies directly to me. Often I feel as if I am living life alone. I do believe God cares about me personally and loves me. I am sometimes concerned that life is random and purpose is evasive. I do feel bound and desire to break free from destructive behavior. I do thirst to go beyond my limitations, to be amazed, to enjoy intimate communion with God. I want to love and be loved. I want to make a mark on this world.I like the manner in which each need is discussed and the how-to is answered with Scripture. I like how the author continually points the reader to the Word. Reading the words of Man Alive will do nothing to help if the words aren't put into action, just as we are to be doers of the Word, not hearers only (James 1:22).I conclude with a quote from the end of the book:"So here's your challenge. Instead of ignoring your primal needs, or letting them drag you into a wasted life, claim them as God's gifts to you."I love it! Patrick Morley does not disappoint in his promise "I'll show you how." This is a great book for any man searching for answers to many of the questions he must deal with.I received this book free from Waterbrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review. I wasn't required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, part 255: "Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising."

$review_text.: It could be called the 21st Century war of Roses.  Not at all far-fetched.  Here you have a population disarmed - hence ripe for abuse - so beaten down by &#34;political correctness&#34; that they can only hide and quiver from their fate.  Critics call it racist, ignoring the blatant racial and religious extremism of militant Islam.  It could have been better written, but one is not looking here for great literature - rather for stirring the souls of men who are willing to pay the necessary price in order to be free.  Conceptually, this book has a lot of value.  Let us pray that it not come to this, but if it does, let us pray that we will find it within ourselves to do what has to be done.

$REVIEW.: Every once in a while, you come across a book that is perfection. For me, Loving Mr. Daniels is that book. I love this book in ways that I can&#8217;t even begin to describe.Roller coaster of emotions doesn&#8217;t even begin to describe how I felt when reading this book. I smiled, I swooned, I laughed, and I cried (like, full on crying not just one or two tears). This book made me feel things that I&#8217;ve *never* felt while reading a book. My heart was broken and mended time and again.The characters in this book were something special. I wanted to give every single one of them a hug. I adored Ashlyn and her bookiness. I, too, fell in love with Mr. Daniels. Ryan (especially) and Hailey were the type of friends that everyone needs. I loved them and what they added to the story. And I absolutely loved that Gabby was a part of the story in her own unique and special way. Beautifully done.The story, every single word, was perfect. The ups and downs were crafted in just the right the way. While this book is certainly a romance, it&#8217;s so much more. It&#8217;s a story about friendships, siblings, loss, healing, and finding oneself. Cherry has a way with words! There are so many quotable passages in this book that it&#8217;s too hard to pick a favorite.To say that I loved this book is an understatement. It&#8217;s certainly my favorite book of the past few years.You can read all of my reviews on my blog, KDH Reviews.

$REVIEW.: Serial novels are making a come back in 2013, and author J.H

Glaze has successfully jumped on the tracks and is steaming ahead with Episode II of his Rune Young Adult Serial Novel

It seems like only yesterday that I was drawn in by Episode I: Awareness, and here we have Episode II: Nemesis ready, with Episode III in the works I hear tell


A serial novel, will have times when it will slow down, and others when it will speed up
Rune gives you both the fast-paced action, and the slow steady back story that is needed to make the tale complete.Our characters spend Nemesis learning more about the history that surrounds what has happened to Jacob

We are introduced to a new character, who Glaze has given a unique set of characteristics, making him a well crafted addition to the story


Awareness brought us action, fast and furiously, Nemesis brings us the steady flow of the calm before the storm
Yes, I can almost guarantee that there is a storm of action coming.Alas as the #opinionatedreviewer I generally find something to be picky about, thus 5 Hearts are so hard to receive from me


Nemesis, left me wanting something

Not more action, but more information


Personally I felt that some conclusions were found too easily, too quickly

Maybe this is a deliberate plot device though, and that would be great! J.H


Glaze always like to keep his reader guessing until the very end.

$REVIEW.: I read the first book before I received this book from the author in return for a honest review.  I had a hard time putting this down.  It is action packed and full of characters that are interesting.  It begins with the main character running for her life.  She leads a life full of adventure, being raised after the loss of her parents by a band of thieves.  I am very glad that the author is writing more to this series due to popular demand, I love this genre and this is a well written series.

$review_text.: It was only while I was reading the first book that I discovered it was one in a trilogy - and the individual books had the tendency to leave you hanging mid-air at the end so that you were more or less obliged to buy the next one if you wanted to know the full story

BUT - it was a quick read, smoothly written, fun story and I found myself WANTING to read the continuation

I really liked how it seemed the most natural thing to every character in the book that there are dragons, spells, black magic..


it did not start out as a fantasy genre (at least I did not realise it) but that aspect gave everything a fun twist

First time I read something along those lines and really enjoyed it
Great love story too!

$review_text.: I really liked the premise of the story but the synopsis had me a bit confused. At the end of the product description it asked how Gabe could ever win over a "proper" girl. Well, I'm sorry but if you're trying to seduce your boss then most likely than not you're not a "proper" or "good girl". Being known as a "good girl" myself I found it kind of unbelievable that someone like Elle would do something like that...The author does a good job trying to persuade us that for Elle to do something like that is out of character and out of her comfort zone - but it's still pretty unbelievable. I also thought the plot was a bit thin and the climax a bit disappointing. Overall, a nice romantic read but nothing out of the ordinary..

This isn't just an overview, though: chapters then offer detailed step-by-step applications for over two hundred common problems from insomnia to ulcers and back pain, pairing therapeutic direction with diagrams of zones

It's a fine beginning point for any who would learn facial reflexology and apply it to alternative healing paths.

$review_text.: This amazing book is not only on point, it does so in a way that reflects solid thinking presented with respect to those who preceded this author on all sides of the argument.  As Sir Isaac Newton said, &#34;I stand on the shoulders of giants&#34; and Mathew Vines has done the same.  I'm certain there will be those who cling to their positions proudly, but i am equally certain that many more will be moved by this book, should they have the courage to read it with God's help, to reconsider their positions.I am still in the early parts of the book, so i will return with a full review once i've finished.  But what i've read so far is of such importance that i felt i must let readers know that this is the next book they need to read on the subject.I should say at this point that i just finished &#34;A Letter to my Congregation&#34; by Ken Wilson, a book that i feel has importance because it comes from a Vineyard pastor and because it provides direction that is relevant in the context of the very conservative church.  That said i think Matthew Vines' book takes a stronger tack in this discussion.  So, if you are thinking of recommending books on this subject, for your more conservative friends start them with Ken Wilson's and then follow with Matthew Vines' book.  Otherwise, i think you should recommend Matthew Vines' book and then follow with Ken Wilson's.

Create our own, fantastic ice cream with these delicious recipes!  This book has 31 different recipes, so you can try a new one every day of the month.  It's got the traditional ones like "pure vanilla bean" ice cream (even "Mexican vanilla"), and some that you may not have heard of before (like "prune" and "bacon flavored" ice cream.)  Ok, I'll admit, the bacon ice cream does not appeal to me at all, but maybe if the zombie apocalypse were coming and the world was going to end, I would definitely try it.  Regardless, with such a wide selection, you are bound to find your favorite in there somewhere, and the "banana chocolate" sounds like the one for me.Recommended to all ice cream lovers.

Against the backdrop of the Hawaiian landscape, Anela not only discovers a family she never knew existed, but learns to forgive and therefore heal.The love story between Anela and Christian was sweet, and not without its challenges, and I found myself rooting for the two of them to work out. Though the tragic loss her mother ended a chapter of her life, it also cleared the way for Anela to start again, and this story showcased the importance of letting go of the past and moving on to a brighter future.A great summer read.

$REVIEW.: Scott Mason, a bad boy rocker who is tattooed, a lead singer, man-whore; what's not to love?  But there is more to him than what meets the eye.  Emma, hiding a secret and guarding her heart is steering clear of Scott."I had no intention of getting involved with a tattooed, spikey-haired rock dude who wore his waistband under his ass cheeks, slept around and had commitment issues. Those were the types that had me running from the hills."Rocked Under is a sexy, angsty, filled with lots of sexual tension and hot, sweaty goodness!  The storyline is a bit predictable, but the writing is good and had some really great elements.Both main characters, Emma and Scott, do a lot of back and forth almost giving my heart a little whiplash.  But it worked with the storyline.  These characters had a connection and fought it almost every step of the way.  I really enjoyed how the tension built between Emma and Scott and yet how they took time to get to know each other.  As with all great reads, Rocked Under pulled a little at my heart, stomped on it a bit and then put it back together."It's always been you. I'm incapable of loving anyone else. It's you or no one. I would be so good to you, babe. Please, just give me a shot at making you happy."  SWOON!A couple of parts of the story were a bit disconnected to the rest of the story that left me scratching my head a bit wondering the significance.  It seemed like a thought or scene interrupted.  There were other parts of the story that I felt had significance but missed delving deeper.I was glad to see that these characters story will continue in a second book.  I love being able to get a bit more of characters we just begin to know and love.All in all, this was a great read and gave me that little bit of an escape from daily life that I look for in a book.  Author Cora Hawkes did a great job with this novel and I loved the British elements kept with the character of Emma.  Give it a try!  4.0~Stars

$REVIEW.: It's been years since they've seen each other, and the parting was forced by their families...families which have been feuding for over a century. She has something he wants, and for the future of his family, he needs to get her to agree. Will she be as willing when she finds out about his ulterior motive? Since the sparks are still flying, neither is immune to the other at the moment.While the plot is solid, and the writing good, there were two things that bothered me. First, does a story really need to be 50% sex? It doesn't add to the quality of the story when there is so much focus on it. Second, why bother making this a 'short story' when it clearly continues over several more 'novellas'. I would have preferred to have the story all at once. I'm glad this one was free on Amazon, but I won't likely read the rest since they're all $2.99. I'm sorry, but while I like a good sex scene, over half the book is too much and at almost $15 to get the whole story... Um, no thanks.

Nina Weaver continues to grow and develop, and Rachel becomes important in her own right. I'm curious to see how Nina's abilities will play out in the next book, but until then, I'll probably reread the first two.Though there isn't a resolution in this book, it is nicely set up for the next one. I hope the third book is as good as this one!

$REVIEW.: There are reasons that I rarely read or review self-help books, and "Spark" epitomizes those reasons.  If the author had toned back from the infinite mind and suggested more strongly that the techniques in her book were more of a precursor to real creative thought, I might have been more of a believer.  Instead, it seems like the author is suggesting that all you need is a creative attitude and the belief that you have an infinite mind and you will be creative.Sadly, to those of us in the business of inventing things the ability to invent is rarely one where I invent because I have lowered the boundaries in my mind so that I have an infinite mind.  If that were true, faster-than-light-drive would already have been invented.  Yes, having an open mind and reducing boundaries to creative thought can enhance creativity.  However, when it comes to hard-core invention (say, a fuel injector or a telephone) it takes much more than wishful thinking on the part of the inventor to lead to an invention.  I will invent because my mind is without boundaries; ummm...what about some sort of education or experience relevant to invention?Many people seem to think that creativity and invention occur through some magical process and that virtually anyone can do it.  Yes, many people are indeed creative, but they do not require a mantra to be creative.  Preparing your mind to be creative may help, but there is a lot of other stuff that should happen as well - like the actual creation part.As for invention, since patents are the best indicator we have for invention and since the number of people who are inventors is a tiny fraction of the population, invention is a very rare thing indeed and I doubt any manner of positive thinking will change that.Summary:  This book is about the power of positive thinking and opening your mind.  While the premise seems promising, in reality the process is lacking in details.  Creative people will not need this book.  People seeking to be creative will find it puts them no further ahead.Good luck!The author's representative provided me with a review copy of this book.

He included blurbs of all his books at the end anyway, so there was no need for the insertions.

$REVIEW.: Other reviewers have wondered about the intended audience for this book.  The concepts are too difficult for non-mathematicians, and really not suitable for being presented in small chunks.But my precocious teen is enjoying this book.  For reference, she is a high school freshman taking pre-Calculus, she loves math, and intends to major in math.  Much of this book is over her head, but she is enjoying the survey of topics, getting a glimpse of the breadth of the math field, expanding her math vocabulary, and seeing that there is so much more that she needs to learn.  As she would say, she likes &#34;nerding out&#34; with this book.

$REVIEW.: Spring is a remarkable, powerful, and lightweight J2EE framework that does not require the use of EJBs, but rather applies a design principle called Inversion of Control. Spring In Action is a handbook for Java developers, especially enterprise developers, that delineates how to best take advantage of Spring's properties and integrate it with other web frameworks. From a "jump start" crash course in how to use Spring, to wiring beans, creating aspects, hitting the database, managing transactions, remoting, accessing enterprise services, building the web layer, securing Spring applications and much more, Spring In Action covers all the bases with extensive examples and explicit instructions. Spring In Action is recommended as a superbly organized and fluently written instruction and reference manual.

$REVIEW.: Sam Moffie creates another Masterpiece as he takes the reader on a spiritual journey through the life of Eli Canaan, who is a unique character, obsessed with sexual encounters with Abigail, and faced with the consequences of a hex that a gypsy strikes upon him. The story is as intelligent as NO MAD and as comical as THE ORGAN GRINDER AND THE MONKEY, which makes THE BOOK OF ELI, the icing on the cake. Abigail paid one-thousand dollars to a gypsy, while concerned about her husband's promiscuity, having no idea what the end results would be. Little did she know that Eli's life was about to change, after he is awakened from a deep sleep, totally convinced that what was about to happen had to be a dream. As he begins to hear voices, informing him that he committed adultery, he feels guilt and regret after speaking to God, believing that his behavior is what directly lead him to the gates of Heaven. Julius, who is Eli's guide, sent from God, is on a mission to direct Eli on the road to a rewarding life. As Eli begins to walk on a spiritual path, he learns from the teachings of Jesus, and many others. Through these voices of his advisors, he begins to focus on changes concerning ongoing issues that society is forced to deal with, such as the outrageous salary of an athlete, or the religious institutions that don't pay taxes. The astonishing story-telling becomes unpredictable and more interesting as Eli voices his opinion in an open and honest, tell-it-like-it-is style. I highly recommend this novel to all fantasy and fiction lovers who enjoy philosophy, blended with satire, and humor. The author penned a delicious, well crafted page turner on the ultimate redemption of a man who made a complete U-turn in his life as his mind begins to shift on life's most important matters. What was Eli's view-point on the misinterpretations of the teachings of Jesus? How did he feel about Hollywood's juicy gossip to the public? What did he think about people focused on the weather, instead of current events in the world? The clever author covers each mischievous page with wit and irony as the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth is told by Eli Canaan. What insight did Sigmund Freud pass on to Eli? What was Eli's opinion about worshipping money and sex before God? Sam Moffie painted a triumphant story in a delightful read. "THE BOOK OF ELI" will surprise you as much as Patrick Swayse did in GHOST, and will make you laugh as much as Jack Nicholson did in AS GOOD AS IT GETS.

$REVIEW.: Almost non existing romance which is fine by me. Young characters, so I was expecting lots of puppy love (yawn) and was pleasantly surprised by nonstop action, intrigue, plot twists and quite a bit of humor. Love the witty dialogue. Not sure I would recommend for super YA though, as the violence can get pretty graphic (not just sex should keep books R rated).My one complaint is that the plot drags on a bit too much.... Enough already! This Sovereign character better start making a real appearance. However, throughout the 9 books we've seen Sienna grow, change, make friends and allies. We've identified enemies that later become friends and then enemies again... What a rollercoaster!  Overall, a very very entertaining series that I started one weekend and hooked me up until I devoured all 9 books in less than a week. Ugh! And now have to wait for #10!

Easer has managed to do something that very few authors are able to do

Very few authors can throw me off balance enough to make me question everything I have just read


After finishing the whole story, I am still quite unsure of which of the main characters was the most evil, or actually if they all were off their rockers, heck, I'm not even sure that they all really existed
I must say the deer bit was So over the top, that I just knew the rest of the book would have me strapped in tight and holding on for dear life

I wasn't disappointed


I liked the way the story ended
I enjoyed Ms

Easer's quick wit and twists throughout

If you liked Shutter Island, give this one a try
You are forewarned there are mentions of sex, rape, and foul language, This one is not for the faint of heart
If you can get beyond those issues than I believe you will find the story to be Wonderful

$review_text.: Ho hum I murmured as I ordered this new book on the Lincoln murder. How wrong I was for this book by Anthony Pitch is the best tome I have ever read on the assassination of Abraham Lincoln our greatest president.Patch is a Washington tour guide who leads folks to the sites pertaining to the tragic death of Lincoln. We follow him through these 400 intensenly sad, exciting, tragic and revealing pages as our eyes focus on the events of 1865. Lincoln was the first president who was assassinated and the nation was thunderstruck at his death.On the night of April 14, 1865 at about 10 PM the president was shot by John Wilkes Booth the hubristic actor and ladies man before about 1600 spectators of "Our American Cousin"in Ford;s Theatre. Booth leaped to the stage and escaped with his accomplice the callow David Herold as they sought to escape to Virginia. Booth was a rabid Confederate supporter who wanted to murder Lincoln. Booth was also a racist who favored slavory and the southern way of life. John Wilkes Booth at 26 years of age became the most infamous murderer in American history.Pitch begins the tale by recounting how assassination was a threat Lincoln had to deal with through the illiad of woes which was his term of office. Lincoln's train had to be rerouted through Baltimore as he prepared to be inaugurated. Only the quick thinking of Detective Allen Pinkerton and others kept his from harm from rabid secessionists in the Maryland City. He also was shot at one night as he rode his horse to the Soldiers Home. Booth had threatned harm the day of the first inauguration as Lincoln emerged to take the oath via the East Portico of the White House.Booth wanted to kidnap Lincoln and drew conspirators to his mad scheming. This plan was abandoned when the actor decided he would star in the drama of death by killing Lincoln at Fords Theatre during a time of celebration in Washington following the surrender of Lee's army at Appamattox Court House.Anthony Pitch paints the tragic picture of Lincoln's mortal wounding, the long night spent by the dying president in the Peterson Boarding House across the street from Ford's and the inconsolable wailing and grief of Mary Todd Lincon. Lincoln died at 7:22 Am on April 15th. Edwin Stanton the Secretary of War is reputed to have said, "Now he belongs to the Ages" (or angels).Edwin Stanton was implacable in his search for the guilty murderers. He made sure no leniency would be etended to those captured. When the conspirators were taken into custody they were treated with great harshness. They had to wear uncomfortable bags over their heads; suffered solitary confinement and were given a minimum diet. They were also restricted in their contacts with family and friends. Even though they were all civilians they were tried by a military court consisting of nine judges.On that same night conspirator Lewis Payne had sought to murder the injured Secretary of State William Seward. He entered Seward's home with a large knife and club wounding Seward, his sons Frederick and Augustus and two servants.The author then traces the spoor of Booth and David Herold who fled for safety in Virginia. After being helped by Confederate sympathizers including Dr. Samuel Mudd who treated Booth's wounds they were captured at the Garrett farm in Virginia on April 26th. Booth died of a gunshot wound probably administered by Sergeant Boston Corbett. Herold was taken captive as were other conspirators.The conspirators were tried in a military tribunal for over seven weeks. 4 men were given long sentences: Michael O'Laughlin, Samuel Arnold, Dr. Mudd and Edmund Spangler. 4 were senteced to death and hanged in July, 1865: Lewis Payne, George Atzerodt, David Herold and the first woman to be executed by the federal government-Mary Surratt. The conspirators had meet for many meetings in Mrs. Surratt's boarding house on H Street. Despite attempts to reduce or pardon her she did die on the gallows.John Surratt fled captivity serving in the Papal Zouave Army until he was captured in Italy. He was taken in chains to Washington where he was released after a hung jury. He was allowed to go free.We are there as we see the autopsies performed on Lincoln and John Wilkes Booth; attend the national funeral of Lincoln and follow Booth and Herold on their wild flight to freedom which ended in death. Sparkling clear prose makes the teardrops flow at this searingly sad American tragedy of Shakespearean proportions. This book clearly evinces how truth is stranger and more interesting than fiction.Anthony Pitch's book is a sine qua non on the Lincoln murder. It is riveting reading and will be a story you will not forget. Excellent and essential for all students of Lincoln, the Civil War and American history!

They battle soul stealing demons and they rock.This story had a lot of moments where you thought ' oh, they are never going to make it' and they do. The battles are awesome and the people are broken, real and full of history that they need to learn to overcome.I love that Scout is the best big sister.

$REVIEW.: I started reading 'The Secret Burden: Letting Go of the Shame, Anger, and Guilt of Emotional Eating' by Michelle Bybel and in the back of my mind I was thinking, here we go again! This is going to be another one of those diet books with all the contradicting advise from one of these so called 'authorities' on how to loose weight and why you eat the way you do. I knew it was coming just by looking at the cover of the book, anyone with all those letters (LCSW, CHHC) is going to be saying what we all heard before, &#34;you're eating because you were traumatized as a kid&#34;, &#34;because your parents divorced when you were young&#34;, &#34;because your mother did it&#34;, etc. Well, you know that old saying, &#34;Don't judge a book by its cover&#34; and I should have listened because it was nothing like that. I didn't even know I was an emotional eater!The author entered this field because of her own experience struggling with her weight and tells what she learned, tried, what worked and didn't. If she knew what is wrong with doing this or that (which some do go against some of these so called experts advise) then she states it. She doesn't go with the flow just because others before her said this is how it is done. This is a real account of what she learned and she is coaching the reader on how to follow through with the variety of exercises (and I don't mean physical exercises, I mean writing, thinking, exploring, things like that but don't get me wrong, she does eventually get to the physical exercise) to change your own mindset.The majority of the book is all about mindset, what it is and how to change it which is not something you can do overnight. In fact, it takes many weeks and months to do some of these exercises. The author also includes sheets, websites, and excellent instructions on how, when, and why. The directions are easy to follow and in some cases a matter of going to website and printing out a page to fill in the blanks. The stress is all on your mindset and for you to understand it, as well as understanding your own body both physically and mentally. Once you understand yourself and change your mindset, then you can work on really loosing weight otherwise you are going to be on that roller coaster of loosing weight just to put it right back on a few months later and make yourself miserable (and deprived of your favorite foods) in the process.Then the exercises are put together and you create a personalized plan for you to follow. Don't worry, she tells you how and remember, this is a plan you put together using your answers on your exercises. This is not someone who barely knows you and hasn't a clue what your likes and dislikes are and you going crazy trying to follow a plan that you can't do or hate. You put together your own plan.For once I have finally found a book that makes sense! I didn't know about &#34;triggers&#34; and totally enjoyed the practical and realistic advise as well as the totally doable sample recipes at the end. I also love that this book is about the total person and not just the waistline. If you don't do things for yourself and feel good about yourself then chances are not only will you suffer at meal time, you will suffer in the many other ways which are explained in the book. It totally makes sense!I would recommend this book to everyone even if you don't think you have an eating issue.
$SUMMARY.: Finally something that makes sense!

$review_text.: I did truly enjoy this short read.  I have to admit I was a little put off by the length.  I felt that rather than having a good quick read.  The book really just rushed to the end.  Also, I felt the story was a little too big for the time devoted to it.  While I do generally like Neil Gaiman quite a bit.  I felt that he may have given Amy short shrift here making her a little too annoying and a little childish.  I never got that from any of the Doctor Who television episodes I'd watched.  But again, I guess that's a take you could have on some of her more insufferable moods.  But again, I felt it was overdone.All in all I did really like the short little work, just really wanted more....

$REVIEW.: By writing a biography which, as the subtitle indicates, focuses on a "literary family" Juliet Barker has produced a definitive work on the Brontes. She places the famous trio of Charlotte, Emily, and Anne in the context of their family and their Yorkshire culture with extensive research not previously well explored. During six years as curator of the Bronte Parsonage Museum at Haworth, Barker became well acquainted with not only extensive Bronte family correspondence, but also local newspapers containing a wealth of data on the cultural and religious environment of the Bronte family. Her descriptions are so rich you almost feel she lived in 19th century Haworth rather than the 21st century version dominated by tourist buses and souvenir shops.She completely destroys many of the Bronte myths created by Elizabeth Gaskell in her 1857 "The Life and Times of Charotte Bronte" -- particularly the prejudiced negative portrayals of Charlotte's father Rev. Patrick Bronte and husband Rev. Arthur Nicholls. It is a monster of a book at 979 pages and some readers may be tempted to scan some of the quotations from the juvenilia written by the four youngest Bronte children about their imaginary civilizations. Most of the book, however, is mesmerizing simply because of the wealth of the author's detailed research and the fascinating revelations it provides about a family which one might assume the world already knew everything. The secret to this book's success is its consideration of the whole family in context rather than an isolated individual biography. As the author's concludes,"Without this intense family relationship, some of the greatest novels in the English language would never have been written."

$REVIEW.: Hanson is a 4th generation Californian who grew up under the old assimilationist model of the 50's and 60's when English was the official language. Any cockiness from a Latino migrant would have been answered this way: "If it really is so good over there, why don't you go back?" That doesn't happen anymore.He describes the irony of Latino migration northward to freedom, only to assume here the same tribalist, statist values they fled. These values are enforced by the Movimiento and assisted by American benevolence and self-loathing. "Malinchismo," the supposed American betrayal of the Mexican people, is readily believable to an American public indoctrinated with guilt in their own public schools.

$review_text.: Vengeance is Mine, ISBN: 9781935711360, Peak City Publishing e-book by Harry James Krebs is an engaging murder mystery.On Ben Tucker's eighteenth birthday his girlfriend had been raped and murdered. Reaction caused this honor student rapid mental deterioration but seventeen years later he is author of a best seller based upon his investigative reporter activity for a North Carolina newspaper with a contract to produce another. He adores his teen age daughter, Amanda Jane, whom he shares with his former wife. Again married, wife Maggie is owner and CEO of a series of department stores valued in the millions. From a blue collar family with little interest in money he is `the love of her life' after her unfortunate first experience. This marriage comes with teen daughter, Julie, who he also adores and incidentally is a friend of Amanda's, Maggie's mother Nora, a real sweetheart, Roberta, the family's Major Domo and Oscar an unusual Dachshund.Ben, experiencing writer's block, is contacted by Lt. John Netter of the Cary Police Department whom he had befriended during his investigative reporter days. Lt. John Netter is faced with an elusive serial killer and invites him to join the team that also included Lainie MacKenzie, a beautiful woman FBI Profiler. There are more grisly murders and a confusing trail with few clues until suddenly Ben and his loved ones personally are involved. Further detail would be a disservice to prospective readers.Summary: a well plotted/written tale with believable characters dependent a little heavily on serendipity but intriguing. A caveat for those disturbed by gross anatomic imagery.

$review_text.: This was such a touching and at times funny book. I so enjoyed reading it, although towards the end I wanted to smack Dee on the back of the head and ask her what she was thinking! Dee is a yoga instructor who started doing yoga to help herself after a horrible car accident. Over the years she has become really good at it and has a few private patients she sees as well as the classes she teaches in the school. Lately she has been teaching more because her boss and friend is pregnant and unable to teach. When she goes to a party she was invited to by Lucy one of her regulars, who just happens to run a huge corporation, she meets Ethan, Lucy's brother. He is just a gorgeous as in the papers but seems nicer in person. There is something about him that draws her to him. She is offered a job which will help get her annoying mother off her back, so after much hesitation she takes it. Taking this job leads her into a world of rich and powerful people, along with Ethan who offers her business advice for free. She develops a  huge crush on him, which is ridiculous because he is way out of her league she thinks. Suddenly he returns her feelings, and has for awhile just wasn't sure if she did, and there is much sneaking around and romance. Being outed by the newspaper was terrible she calls it off with him because she overhears him and his sister talking about her. Later we find out they hadn't meant it the way it sounded, and when they get together at the end its very touching to say the least. I enjoyed reading about the heartache, and the chance a woman can have to live again. I would rate this book a four out of five!!!

$review_text.: Inside the pagan community and without there is an on going debate as to the origins of gardenerian Wicca

On one side of the debate you have authors like Heselton and Whitmore who believe that Wicca is an ancient pre-christian religion that centered on a Goddess and God
On the other side you have authors like Ronald Hutton and Aidan Kelly and Tanya Lurman will maintain that Wicca is a new religious movement
Aidan Kelly&#8217;s perspective is unique because he is in fact an insider who practices witch craft

Dr


Kelley invented his own tradition of witchcraft with some other students in Sand Francisco


He was one of the founding members of the New Reformed Order of the Golden Dawn.Since he himself has founded his own, or at least helped found his own witchcraft tradition, he finds nothing wrong with what Gerald Gardner did
In fact it is a sign of healthy society that shows spark of creativity
 At one point all religions were man made and at one point they were new religious movements

Many religious movements whither and die it is only those few that meet the needs of the people that end up surviving


Judaism, Islam and Christianity are examples and so is Wicca

The number of Wiccans and Pagans doubles up every two years.Gerald Gardner made many false claims implying that Wicca was an ancient religion
Of course when new religious movements come about they will often claim they are the original or the corrected version that people are supposed to follow

All religions start this way


Most follower identify this and just live with the fact that historical reality and mythos are not necessarily the same.Aidan Kelley put the written works thorugh a scholarly test to determine if there was any truth to Gerald Gardner&#8217;s claims
Searching through Gardner&#8217;s belonging kept by Ripley&#8217;s museum of witchcraft and documents held by Carl Wesche he was able to determine through careful analysis and detective work that Gardner&#8217;s claims were false

Among the papers he found several versions of the same ritual often with dyslexic spelling and cross outs
Many of the rituals had undergone revision
These are the signs of authorship not copying something down from a book of shadows
Almost all of gardners works were direct plagiarisms

Elements were lifted dire  tly out of Crowley&#8217;s works, Lelands Aradia, Rudyard kipolings work etc
Doreen Valiente saw this and when she was intiated she rewrote almost all of it.One things that Aidan makes note of is Gereald&#8217;s interesting in spanking and bondage


His new religion sanctified it 
The book does a good job of telling the background story of Wicca and how Gerald Created it
I think Hutton&#8217;s book is more complete though
 Inventing Witchcraft tends to over do  on printing in the text and analyzing it.In the end after all my research I have come to the conclusion that Gerald Gardner did in fact invent Wicca from available sources

His witchcraft is very much influenced by Ceremonial Magiack
However I do believe that there were precedents about for following witchcraft and following the Goddess that Gardner was not expose to

I enjoyed the historical excursion.

$REVIEW.: While some in the mainstream media--Michael Kinsley's NYT Sunday Book Review is a recent case in point--have a field day with Glenn Greenwald's personalized presentation in No Place To Hide, Kinsley's drive-by attacks on him and, gratuitously, Julian Assange, are prime examples of how and why the rules of investigative journalism must be different now.I applaud Greenwald for using the immense platform he's earned to advocate, yes advocate, for reporting that's transparent with it's opinions rather than pretending they don't exist. For his data-driven skepticism of official pronouncements. For exposing the unacknowledged biases of media stars unwilling to jeopardize their positions by questioning the talking points and leaks handed to them by the powerbrokers they purport to cover.Had Kinsley, for instance, learned anything from his time with No Place To Hide, his review might have disclosed that the NYT comes in for harsh criticism from Greenwald. But no, readers might have to consider that fact when evaluating Kinsley's dismissive tone.

$REVIEW.: Approx. 1280 locationsA little rushed, but still intense. The story was too short to really allow readers to get to know the characters. The ending was shocking and then confusing before the HEA. There are so many stories out there I wish were longer and this is one of them. I mean the story spans nearly 8 years and I read this whole thing in just over an hour. The blurb and sample pulled me in, but other than some well written sex scenes there wasn't much substance.As a price comparison, I have found $0.99 m/f romances that were 4x longer than novellas like this. And other m/m books that were the same price, $2.99, and were longer. For how short the novella was I personally did not get my money's worth. But based on other reviews, it seems others did.

$REVIEW.: The plot: World War II veteran Edward Bond's recuperation from a disastrous fighter plane crash takes a distinct turn for the weird when he encounters a giant wolf, a red witch, and the undeniable power of the need-fire, a portal to a world of magic and swordplay at once terribly new and hauntingly familiar

In the Dark World, Bond opposes the machinations of the dread lord Ganelon and his terrible retinue of werewolves, wizards, and witches, but all is not as it seems in this shadowy mirror of the real world, and Bond discovers that a part of him feels more at home here than he ever has on Earth.This was the book that Roger Zelazny said was the biggest influence on his Amber series (note that each had a character named Ganelon, which itself was taken from the Paladin stories of the post-Charlemagne time period), but Amber is certainly an improvement over this


 The writing is not horrible, but quite bland

 The story is pretty straight-forward, with not much in the way of surprises.

Weary from the mental and physical stress of these youthful activists, Penny and Sharon make a deal that when their magnificent seven graduates they celebrate in Finland.  However, a few years later the deal appears dead when Penny and her brood move to California.In 1993, Penny sends Sharon a ticket that will send the dynamic duo from San Francisco to London to Helsinki.  The supermoms are running away from home now that graduation has occurred.  With two West Coast sisterchicklet baby boomers invading Europe, will the English and the Finns survive and will American diplomacy (Clinton style) be needed to calm the waters and snow that the daring duo dive into as they go from one brash adventure into another.This is a fun tale that feels like Lucy and Ethel taking Europe in the 1990s, yet each one remembers why they were and still are best friends while renewing their faith in God.  The key to the tale is the message that plenty of life remains to enjoy for the over forty crowd without Robin Jones Gunn preaching to the choir.

$REVIEW.: This is a summery of some of Chestertons work


It gives some insights into Chesterton's opinions and writing style.I agreed with much of it, though some was odd

Distributionism always seemed an "all very well" sort of thing as there was no practical way to bring it about
It seemed to have an overpropensity to assume the ill-will of people who disaggree
And it made the utterly ridiculous point that the Middle Ages were better then the present time
Now I myself think that the Middle Ages are rather unfairly treated and had things to admire about them but better?Those are just some of the things-which might be as much my disaggreement with Chesterton


The book has advantages

Chesterton was a funny writer and knew how to make people laugh
He also had an off-hand turn of mind that can make one think


The author gives a fair number of Chesterton passages as well as his commentary.Much of Chestertons writting is still "relevant" now(it is a delicious thought to imagine what he would have done to dissect that irritating word "relevant") though some is out of date
This is a fairly good intro.

Thanks to techology, we can use it to pay bills online, we can play with games, music and apps on small tablets, as will as read books on them with a swift of our fingers to turn the page. But maybe "It's a Book" will teach us a good lesson to not get hooked on techology all the time.In Lane Smith's funny book, we see a donkey and a monkey in the same room, but with different things. The donkey has a computer and the monkey has a book. As we read, the donkey asks the monkey some questions on his book like can it scroll down?, does it have a mouse? (a mouse pops out of the monkey's hat), and does it make a TOOT-ing sound, but the monkey says no. So when the donkey sees the book for himself, he gets a good story and a good funny surprise.This may the funniest, hilarious book that will just make kids and adults laugh, and the title speaks for itself. The book does tend to have the word "jack-ass", so don't be surprised by that in the story. Every page is filled with humorous lines and illustrations. It even show kids not to be hopped on technology all the time, and that the feeling of a real book will still entertain them to the last page. So read "It's a Book", it's a book that will really make you LOL.(Grade: A)

$review_text.: Kalli is a hybrid mix of a werewolf and vampire, who comes across her mate Lucas as well as her beloved vampire Nikoli. You follow the main characters journey as well as secondary characters that still play a role in the book. The ending is bitter sweet as it made me sad and then happy. You have to read it to understand!! The book does contain some violent scenes/situations that may be for an older audience.  Overall, I really enjoyed the book and would recommend it to any fans of paranormal books that enjoy action, romance and suspense.  There were only 2 things I disliked about this book.  The first was the shifting POV's in the book, the shift from one POV to another was not always smooth and sometimes felt disjointed and my second issue was the book needed better editing.  The grammar errors were distracting in areas of the book and threw off the overall vibe on the book.  I would be willing to check out other books by this author in the future.

$REVIEW.: For many, maybe most, modern life just is. There is little understanding or even interest in the forces that shape, or more perniciously control, lives. That ignorance in no way disestablishes corporations as the most powerful, self-serving entities of the modern era. However, this book is not particularly concerned with all of the ramifications of their immense power to influence and control society.The book primarily examines the profound change in the legal standing of corporations that occurred in the last half of the nineteenth century and into the first decades of the twentieth. Though not heavily argued, the author contends that Americans in the colonial period were very leery of corporations. After the founding, corporations came into existence only via state charters that specifically detailed and limited a corporation's activities with the real possibility of charter revocation acting as an effective incentive for compliance. But business interests began to battle those limitations, especially on the legal front.The Santa Clara County case decided by the Supreme Court in 1886 was the case on which the subsequent legal empowerment of corporations was based. Though not specifically stated in the opinion, it is commonly held that after that decision, corporations would be viewed as "persons," the subject of the fourteenth Amendment, whereby all persons are entitled to due process and the equal protection of laws. Even the great John Marshall in 1819 had asserted that corporations are an "artificial being ... existing only in the contemplation of law." Now the artificial nature of corporations was being disregarded, clearing the way for consideration as the equal of any citizen with all of the same rights. The fact that corporate resources overwhelm those of any one person appears to not have been considered.In the laissez-faire, Social Darwinist atmosphere of the early twentieth century individuals were left to compete with their corporate "equals." Time and again legislation that sought to ameliorate dreadful workplace conditions was struck down as interfering with liberty of contract, ignoring the one-sidedness of employer-employee exchange.The same thinking is seen in decisions regarding participation in the political process. The author shows how the courts have subtly distorted the meaning of the First Amendment as protecting corporate "speech." In actuality, the amendment protects speakers - real people, not entities. The real speech of corporate stakeholders, such as customers, has routinely been suppressed. For example, a quarterly consumer's section in an energy utility's newsletter was disallowed, despite the utility's monopoly of the region.The author shows that legal decisions regarding corporate personhood have since Santa Clara been very inconsistent and even contradictory. One would have thought that the author would have weighed in on the "strict construction" arguments that have been the  rage over the last few decades. The reading of corporations as persons by the courts is a definite distortion of original intent. Moreover, the original intent of constructing a nation of self-governing citizens has been seriously eroded by allowing monolithic entities to dominate arenas where citizens participate, like elections.The author notes that several movements at the turn of the nineteenth century attempted to counter corporate power, namely the Populists, the Knights of Labor, the IWW, and the socialists. Virtually all of them ran into the power of the state and reactionary forces that contained and eliminated the movements. Some of this material is rather sketchy.In recent years corporations have gained tremendous advantages by being able to relocate internationally facilitated by any number of trade agreements. Through the WTO and other bodies, corporations are able to force nations to rescind legislation that they see as impacting their profitability. The modern anti-corporate movement often takes the form of anti-globalization, perhaps best seen in the Seattle demonstrations against the WTO. In addition, the author hopes for cooperatives or economic democracy as alternatives to corporate power. Such efforts have had little impact.Any number of authors have addressed the dominance of corporations, such as Bakan, Greider, Hartmann, Korten, Schweickart, etc. This book is less comprehensive than those by the authors mentioned. It is a reasonable and readable overview of the legal shenanigans and rationalizations that have occurred concerning the rightful place of corporations in our society over the last 125 years. In an era where conservative movements have gained ascendancy, it is doubtful that any of this literature has a wide audience.

$review_text.: My Review:This book was completely original both in the story and the timeline. The book takes place during the 1930's, but it doesn't read like a historical book...at all! Having the book set during that time period actually creates some really fabulous settings with a boat and train (private cars) for travel modes.The book starts off with an incredible bang when the hero, Grant, wakes up disoriented and naked in an alleyway in Paris, France looking eye to eye with a  miniature white poodle.Leigh is the heroine and she has her own issues...namely her own personal ghost, Jacob, and the fact that she was lured to France under false pretenses and now has no way to make it home.Beatrice & Grant are brother and sister who are trying to find Bea's son and Grant's nephew, Tristan, who disappeared without a trace 3 years ago. Because Leigh is a psychic with a connection to the spiritual world through Jacob, she and Bea hook up. Grant is less than convinced about Leigh's claims.This book was a really interesting read. There are a lot of different paranormal layers...Grant's inner wolf, Leigh's ghost, and Tristan's disappearance and it isn't clear until the very end how it all ties together. I saw the ultimate twist coming only about 3 pages before it happened, but otherwise it was all completely shocking and a surprise. The action stays high throughout the entire book which makes it really fun to read. From the time I started it, I never put it down.Like I said, it was just really creative and I love that about it. I loved both Grant and Leigh's characters. They both have things that they have learned to hide, and it isn't until they start getting honest with each other that all the pieces of the puzzle start to come together. I do NOT read historical books, but the history aspect of this story didn't really affect the story at all except for providing some amazing settings for travel.Overall, I really enjoyed this book. It was completely different from what I normally read. It was interesting, entertaining, suspenseful, and romantic. I found myself completely caught up in the story trying to figure out where it was going next. Really fabulous!

$REVIEW.: This book is a true testament to the Jewish people. Norman Finkelstien an intellectual scholar has gone to great lengths to present and informative, vigourusly researched, well written and truthful conclusion of events. Those with allegations that he presents no research clearly haven't read the book- infact from chapter 3 onwards I had to read everything twice as there was so much factual evidence that my memory could not comprehend it all in one sitting. Those with allegations that the books intent is to de-legitimize Israel obviously haven't read the book. Norman makes a brief connection to the use of the Holocaust post June-1967 in America and in American Jewish circles to justify Israel foreign policy. He makes a breif refrence to the use of the phrse "Holocaust denier" used against people critical to Israel foreign policy. He also notes Israels involvment in the exploiation of reperations from Swiss banks yet notes their hypocrisy to extract the same from America. He does not(like in so many of his other books) ellaborate on the Israel-Palestine issue. - If you bought the book for the purpose of learning more about Israel-Palestine you have bought the wrong book. Those who also claim that Norman is tarnishing the memory of 6 million Jews murdered in the slave labour camps and the concentration camps are also wrong. Norman, in this book attempts to critisize those orginisations who have exploited the memory of Jewish suffering in order to profit. He discusses the fact that many Jewish survivors of the Slave labour camps haven't recieved the reperation and monetary compesnation that they deserve becuase of these corrupt orginizations. Norman also tries to protect the memory of Jewish suffering from the exploits of orginizations such as the WJC, when they attempt to use fruadelent and misdirected evidence to extract far more money then legitmate from the Swiss banks.This book should make every Jew proud. This books should make every Jew proud of the fact that there are fellow semites who wish to defend their suffering to such an extent that they would go against orginizations of their own ethnicity.

$review_text.: I loved this book!!!  I will say that I have read many Amish novels recently and this one truly touched my heart


 Grace suffered abuse at the hands of the husband she was forced to marry to save her family's farm and she needed healing
 God gave that healing to her through the love of Seth
 I have also worked with many autistic young people as a teacher and Abel stole a place in my heart quickly as I read.I love that this novel is focused on grace....God's grace


 We all need grace in our lives and so many of us have suffered abuse at the hands of others and this book can bring healing to those readers as well


 For quilting and painting lovers and enthusiasts, read and see how these two crafts are celebrated among the Amish
 Will painting as an art be allowed for Seth and Abel?  Grace would certainly say yes, wouldn't it?

$REVIEW.: Adele thought her life might finally be on an upswing


 Her mom got a new job in a new town, along with a condo
 They move over the summer, and Adele starts off on the right foot at her new school


 She is hanging out with popular kids, making friends, perhaps even finding romance
 Then, in the blink of an eye, Adele finds herself abandoned by her mother, and homeless


 Will she be able to survive?I really commend the author for taking on the topic of teen homelessness

 While the book itself was a little soft, the topic is one of real concern, and one we rarely see portrayed in young adult books
 The storyline makes it easy to see how good kids end up in bad situations

 Adele was not a runaway, or a drug user, nor was she suffering from mental illness, yet she ends up homeless
 A good kid, who makes decent grades, and has a part time job, ends up homeless


 Bravo to Melody Carson for breaking down stereotypes of the homeless


 While Adele's mom has mental healthy issues that contribute to the situation, Adele herself is a fairly well adjusted, normal kid.The thing that bothered me about the book was it seemed to keep the reader at arms' length
 We never really get to know the characters, we are left with lots of unanswered questions, and we are only scratching the surface of the story and the issues at hand

 I think this could have easily been developed into a more detailed, longer novel, with more depth and character development
 As it is, I felt more like I was reading a blog of a homeless teen than a novel written about a homeless teen.All in all, not a bad book

 This book would be a great way to open up a dialogue about homelessness with young adults
 Unfortunately, the book just left me wanting more

 More about the characters, more about the story, and more about the impact of Adele's homelessness on her life in the long run.

$REVIEW.: The book starts out with the team back in the capital city, along with the ousted Emperor Sespian. Amaranthe has plans to get him back on the throne, but the city has turned into a war zone, with rival factions all backing their preferred candidate. As Amaranthe plots, Sicarius attempts to protect Sespian from a soul-construct.As you know if you&#8217;ve been reading this series, each book features two POVs, Amaranthe&#8217;s and one of her team members. This time its Sicarius, the deadly assassin. I really appreciated this insight into his character. Although he is one of the main characters, I never really took a liking to him the way I did to the rest of the team. I hadn&#8217;t been looking forward to reading his sections of the book, but I surprisingly enjoyed his sections almost as much as Amaranthe&#8217;s.Amaranthe&#8217;s story line follows her, Books, and Akstyr as they attempt to eliminate the Behemoth, Forge&#8217;s ace-in-the-hole on their way to the Throne.Secarius, Sespian, and the rest of the team attempt to gather followers and backers loyal to the true Emperor.The ending really surprised and shocked me, and I am eager to see how this is all going to wrap up.I really enjoyed this book overall, but I can&#8217;t recommend it if you haven&#8217;t read the first five in the series.

$review_text.: Recently I had the opportunity to review Timothy a Little Fish with a Big Purpose by Brad Riley for Cross Focused Reviews.  I started reading this to our youngest (age almost 2) and before I knew it our others ages 10 & 9 were there with us drawn in by the engaging story.The story tells the tale of Timothy, a little fish who obediently followed his mother and grandmother's instructions and therefore was a blessing to those he came in contact with.  What your kiddos might not pick up on is the background is actually the story of the miracle of the fish from Matthew 17.  In that way, the story is engaging to multiple levels of kiddos because it can draw them in on their level of Biblical understanding.On our toddler's level, the bright pictures and the brief text on each page was great.  He didn't stir while we worked our way through.  On another level, you learn about obedience to your parents/spiritual teachers and how that is ultimately being obedient to God.  Further in, you can see how God orchestrates all things for his ultimate good, even using something as small as a fish.I liked the end note where the author talks about adults modeling their faith for their kids, like Timothy's Grandma did in the book.  We as parents and teachers need to be so careful that we are modeling Christ to our kids.The only time where Mr. Riley lost me was where Timothy was supposed to call his mom when he got to his grandma's house.  I understand that it was put in there to show responsibility to kids but the idea of fish and a telephone was stretching for me.I loved this book and was glad to receive a free download of it from Cross Focused Reviews.  The opinions in this review are my own:)

$review_text.: One of the most important books I've read, Sacred Economics brings together many problematic threads of society and shows how they're all connected to our broken value system, our cracked mythology. Eisenstein shows how a beautiful, functioning economy can follow from a proper mythology and how brilliantly transformational this will be when it comes to fruition. People may say these ideas are too idealistic. I say they're the inevitable next step in the evolution of the human race. The concepts may be a few hundred years ahead of their time, but they're a glimpse at a new era of peace and prosperity that will occur as soon as we collectively take responsibility for ourselves, recognize our fundamental unity as a planet, and make the right choices.

$REVIEW.: A story of Syliva, a well respected doctor in Tarrin&#8217;s Bay, but who has a secret that comes back to meet her after she makes a wish at the annual festival. This is the first in the Tarrin&#8217;s Bay series and a good start, although i loved Fast Forward more (and am still telling people about the Epad!)this is a good second book and start to the series. I will certainly be following the whole lot and cant wait for the next book to see how we meet more people from the area and if the characters from January Wish will also be present in other books.

$review_text.: Here is another classic from the stable of Van Holt westerns
It has all the elements needed for the perfect western, mean and moody gunslingers, attractive ladies and plenty of action, all set to a backdrop of small outback towns, dusty trails and evocative scenery.The story follows the quest of Tom Bannon, who is searching to find who killed his brother Troy, why they did it and who was actually behind the killing.The story is well paced and flows smoothly and effortlessly making it an easy and enjoyable read.I love this authors style of writing, you are drawn into the story and spend a few hours absorbed in a totally different world.I actually managed to guess the ending of this story, but only a couple of pages before the end.My only criticism would be that the book only took up 87% of the download
The remainder was devoted to previews of other books
When I discovered this I was disappointed as I thought there was more to read.However, this does not detract from the actual novel and I would highly recommend it to anyone

Keep them coming Van Holt, you keep writing them and I'll keep reading them!

$review_text.: This was my first Mia Sheridan novel.  And this author absolutely blew me away.  I won't go into all the plot details, especially since describing it would not do her writing skills justice.  But I will say that she is an incredibly effective writer that makes her characters come to life.  Archer and Bree are well developed and fully rounded characters that make you love and care for them.  There is a shocking and totally unexpected twist at that end that had my jaw dropping open.  I was so taken with this author, that as soon as I finished this book, I purchased another one (Stinger) by her.  I believe she just made it into my top ten favorite authors of all time.  Try this book...you won't regret it.

$review_text.: What is polygamy?, who is polygamy?, and why? are the three basic questions that Sanjiv Battacharya sets out to answer in this book, as much a story of his own personal journey from faith to atheism to new hope as it is a travelogue of the polygamist communities of the American West.  As a non-believer from a non-Christian background, the author brings new life to the story of Mormonism and plural marriage.  There are no hidden agendas here, no personal vendettas.  Though he gets some facts about the LDS faith wrong (for example, confusing various books of scripture), in general the fact that all of this is new to him allows for an incredibly refreshing perspective.  We follow Sanjiv from the abusive, incestuous hellhole that is the Order to the apocalyptic paradise that is the Rock, to everything in between (the FLDS, Centennial Park, the True and Living Church; the Allred Group stopped taking his calls).  What we discover is heartbreak and duplicity, lives twisted and torn apart, and the systematic abuse of children.  Yet many of the polygamists he meets are also refugees from mainstream society and the LDS church, people whose lives had already been destroyed by divorce and doubt and who discover new strength in fundamentalism.It is no coincidence that polygamists so often compare their lifestyle to that of Hugh Hefner.  In each case women are objects, with essentially no power beyond their own sexuality (a transitory, false power at best). It seems the only authority a female can freely exercise in polygamy is aiding the entrapment and exploitation of other women (Laura Fuller, lawyer for the Kingston Group, and Gail and Laura, sister wives and sex offenders, come to mind).For most of these polygamists, that a woman might communicate directly with Heavenly Father-- with no male intercession-- or exercise real free agency is as absurd an idea as racial equality.  A woman falling in love with two men and having two husbands?  Impossible, "they're not hardwired that way" (it says so in Genesis).The amount of delusionary thinking contained in these pages is staggering.  It makes for a book that is at once both wildly entertaining and very sad.
$SUMMARY.: a refreshing outside perspective on polygamy

Sometimes, it takes a lot of patience and love to learn what makes an animal happy and feel content, and Blucy puts Mandy through a series of wacky situations as the two get to know each other.Blucy's fun rhyming text, vibrant illustrations and underlying message will captivate young children everywhere.As a fan of Julia Dweck's books, I was eager to read Blucy and was provided a copy for review.

$review_text.: As a big fan of Regency romances, I have often gotten recommendations about the Windham Sisters novels.  I finally decided to check them out and ordered them all, but didn't know what order to read them in,  So, I checked Amazon's page on Grace Burrowes, and found out that there were three books written about the Windham Brothers which took place first, so I started there.  I'm currently reading the last of the books on the sisters (Lady Jenny's Christmas Portrait), and I am loving it as much as the other 7 books on the Windham siblings.  Next it's onto the two novels on the Duke and Duchess of Windham's courtship and first few years, as well as a novel about two side characters from two of the Windham sisters books.  They are lovely books, although sometimes I think the misconceptions the bride and groom have about each other can sometimes make the stories drag a bit longer than they need to.

The characters are well written, each with a depth and warmth all their own and I enjoyed the way the author brought each couple together.  Issues are dealt with by each couple but there is also plenty of hot and at times kinky sex as well.  Everyone can identify with one of the characters on some level as the stories progress.  I look forward to reading more by Arden Aoide, she has a way with the written word I truly enjoy.Received copy for review

$review_text.: Robert Devereaux, &lt;strong>Slaughterhouse High&lt;/strong> (Deadite Press, 2010)There is no way I can turn in an unbiased review of this book. I've been a BobDev fan for over twenty years now, ever since Dell's short-lived, unreasonably fantastic Abyss line released his first novel, &lt;em>Deadweight&lt;/em>, in the nineties. At the time, it was the most extreme thing I'd ever read. (And it stayed that way for almost ten years, until I was hit with the double-barrelled attack of Matthew Stokoe's &lt;em>Cows&lt;/em> and Charlee Jacob's &lt;em>Haunter&lt;/em> in 2003; it's still a good solid third.) And as time went on, Devereaux's books got, well more nuts. So when the bizarro movement started co-opting authors, he was a pretty natural fit. Enter Bob's first novel for nasty upstarts Deadite Press: &lt;em>Slaughterhouse High&lt;/em>. (Side note: Deadite are also in the process of re-releasing Devereaux's old stuff. So if you never got a chance to read the brilliant, scurrilous &lt;em>Santa Steps Out&lt;/em>, you have the chance again!) It's got all the charm, and I use that term loosely, of the classic Devereaux canon, the kinds of way-off details that make for good bizarro fiction, and more than enough gore to satisfy all your cannibalistic urges. In short, how can you possibly go wrong?Set in an alternate-universe USA known as the Demented States of America, where the President is a wooden puppet (and a Committee to Assassinate the President is a celebrated cabinet department) and a pair of high school students is slaughtered every year at each high school's prom, &lt;em>Slaughterhouse High&lt;/em> takes place over the course of prom night at Corundum High School, a pimple on the backside of the nothing town of Corundum, Kansas. But this is no ordinary prom night in Corundum: as a gesture of defiance, the prom committee have chosen the Ice Ghoul as a theme for the first time since it was used twenty years before, on the night principal Futzy Buttweiler's daughter Kitty was a member of the slaughtered couple. Futzy is not a happy camper. And neither is someone else--someone who decides to murder the Designated Slasher, take his place, and start piling up far more bodies than the school is prepared to deal with.If this were a fifties mystery film, I can just imagine the trailer as the music swells each time we're introduced to a character who might, just might, be the killer, with big text at the top of the screen: IS IT...? And that's how Devereaux sets it up: as we meet each progressively more unhinged character who just might be the killer, more red herrings start flying, until we're thrashing around in a blizzard of scales. A lesser author might use this as a way to cloud a lack of plot or less than mastery over the elements of the core mystery. Not so Devereaux, who manages to keep both on a tight leash while acting rather like the alpha monkey in the monkey house, flinging poo and satire at American society, eighties slasher flicks, the entire state of Kansas, prom culture, the Tupperware corporation (by the by: a chance aside at one point in the book makes me think that if Devereaux is going to continue on in this universe, we need a book about the rise of the Futter family and their Kitchen Storage Container empire), sexual mores, body modification, and, well, pretty much anything else you can think of. It's funny stuff, but it's the darkest kind of funny--much uglier than the comedy in &lt;em>Santa Steps Out&lt;/em>. I get the feeling Devereaux almost wanted to play this one as a straight horror novel. If you're not sure whether you're supposed to be laughing at the satire, well, by cracky, that's the best kind, no?My only real qualm with the book is that sometimes the pace flags (usually when we move away from the prom and focus on the doings at the top of the political food chain). But that never happens for long, and we get back to the action quickly enough that it should be a minor niggle at best for most readers. Established Devreaux fans will want to pick this one up posthaste; I'd suggest new folks get themselves converted with &lt;em>Deadweight&lt;/em> or &lt;em>Caliban and Other Tales&lt;/em> before diving into this one. But you'll want to pick it up eventually. *** 
$SUMMARY.: An absolute must for Devereaux fans.

I enjoyed reading the part where they discussed the causes of hair loss because for the first time I understood what was happening to my hair.  I had always thought that there was nothing I could do about it but now I know that there are things I can to stop the hair loss I already have.  In the treatments section there are several medical solutions as well as some all natural ones.  I am planning on pursuing the natural methods to see how well it works.

It will keep you glued from the beginning. Julie has recently broken up with her cheating boyfriend and is staying at a casino and trying to write. She is an author or tries to be. She meets Dominic in the elevator and he is very easy on the eyes. There is a lot going on between them and what he is keeping from her. Will she leave him when she finds out what he is hiding? Can he protect her from his secrets? I did notice a few grammar errors but not enough to hinder with the reading or story line. I have read one other set by Clarissa Wild and looking forward to reading more from her.

She begins with the issue of clutter, the obvious place to start, and a short look at how we become cluttered and why it's often hard to tackle the issue and resolve it. Once the clutter is gone, she moves on to the importance of regular and routine cleaning (made easier without the clutter). She looks at each area of the house and how family members can help. She has a lengthy and useful section on natural cleaning products (who knew vinegar and baking soda could clean almost anything?). She ends the book with a list of things to do to help you remain organized. If you're looking for an overall resource on organizing, cleaning and maintaining your home, you'll find most of what you need in this book.

$review_text.: This is one of the best style/fashion books currently in publication and - trust me - I have looked. I am a big fan of Harper's Bazaar magazine, with its glossy spreads and entertaining, clever articles so this book was on my 'must have' list as soon as I discovered its pending publication in Amazon.This book doesn't disappoint.  Fans of magazines like In Style and People Stylewatch will love how this book blends a traditional style guide with the world of fashion and entertainment.  Case in point, the Table of Contents covers the following:(1) The Basics - how to build the 'ultimate wardrobe'; the essentials; the basics; what to spend on and what to save on; and more. Among my favorites? The "Shopping Calendar" which covers what to buy at what time of the year, and "How Many" which covers how many sweaters, tshirts, coats, etc. any well-stocked wardrobe should really have.(2) Personal Style - how to develop your own style; covers top fashion icons of yesterday and today; and the various fashion personalities (ie. Jackie Onassis and Jennifer Aniston as "classicists," Madonna as a "maverick," Kate Hudson and Sienna Miller as "bohemians," Halle Berry and Jennifer Lopez as "bombshells," and so on).(3) Fabulous at Every Age - how to look your best at every age as well as top fashion icons in every age group (and proof that you can look stylish and fashionable even well into your 70s and 80s)(4) Celebrate Your Shape - how to dress for your shape; covers the various "shapes" as well as celebrity examples(5) Office Elegance - dressing appropriately for work; office-wear essentials(6) Evening Glam - party looks; tips on dressing for that special occasion or night out.(7) Casual Chic - casual dressing; building a casual clothing wardrobe; various casual looks; weekend style.(8) The Best Extras - accessories, accessories, accessories!! (yes, bags, shoes, jewelry, and more).(9) Lingerie Essentials - building a basic lingerie wardrobe.The book doesn't get too bogged down with words and text - instead, the tips and ideas are concise and straightforward and makes perfect use of the phrase "a picture is worth a thousand words." For instance, instead of rambling on and describing a classic trench, the reader is provided with 3 examples of why a trench is universally flattering, a picture of a classic trench, and pictures of celebrities wearing trench coats. Another example is the section about the LBD (little black dress) - we are provided with a few paragraphs of why a little black dress is a wardrobe essential, 4 pictures of celebrities wearing their own version of the LBD, 5 pictures of various black dress styles, and even more pictures of accessories that work well with a LBD.Readers who like visuals will love the gorgeous glossy color pictures of celebrities and clothing/accessory pieces. Those who are familiar with Harper's Bazaar magazines beautiful and elegant fashion spreads will be happy to note that similar attention has been given to this book.  It is perfect as a resource guide for fashionistas, a style guide for those who want to improve their wardrobe or just need fashion help, and also makes a very attractive coffee table book. If you plan to buy one fashion/style book this season, then I very highly recommend Harper's Bazaar's Great Style.

$REVIEW.: A handsome anti-hero and a beautiful heroine in distress, both of whom tug at your heartstrings are pitted against a formidable antagonist who almost has superhuman qualities, albeit on the dark side. That is the premise ofA Dangerous Affairand it catches your attention from page 1, never letting up until the end.The story of Lloyd Sullivan, an ex-convict on parole and Jaime Blanchart who is trapped in a bad marriage to the town's sheriff, "A Dangerous Affair" is a suspense thriller with a little romance thrown in. In fact, if I want to be technical about it, the affair between Lloyd and Jaime is a sidebar to the main story of Jaime's husband, Alan Blanchart, dirty cop, abusive husband and psychotic killer hiding behind a badge.But, don't think that this story is formulaic or a cliche. The author Jason Melby created unforgettable characters and fleshed them out nicely - the protagonists, the antagonists and the supporting characters. The story is fast-paced and it gets your adrenaline going.So, why am I giving it only three stars? It's because I feel as if this book is the conclusion of a two-part book. The author never explained why and how Lloyd went to jail. Or what role did Lloyd's brother Josh played? There is also Jaime, who from her musings was a very independent woman before she married Alan. Then, how did she end up marrying Alan when she is from New York.There were so many unanswered questions, and there will be a lot of spoilers if I ask them here. That said, I actually had to check the book several times if this book is not the second-half of a two-part book.This book is Rated M for Mature due to sex and violence.
