$REVIEW.: I have always been fascinated by anything Byzantine, for personal and professional reasons. This is a good read even if the ending is known in advance. My only quibble is that Catholics and Orthodox celebrated Easter on different dates (most of the time), and this could have been brought out in the plot for greater drama, since the Greeks wanted to hold out for their Easter. The author gave a good portrait of Constantine XI, and the character of Zofia, which invented, is not improbable.

$review_text.: Alcorn's Book "Maxed Out - American Moms on the Brink is raw, real, and a necessary read for all working women (especially working moms). She gives a down and dirty view of the reality women face in the workplace by sharing anecdotes from her own personal life and then backs up a lot of her experiences with research and data. I literally bought and read this book in one evening (yes, it was that good -- I could not put it down)! I felt like the author was was writing about my life. Comparing Maxed Out to Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In book--I feel that both have powerful and important messages, however, Alcorn's book seemed more realistic and spoke to me on a personal level. Great book. I highly recommend!

$REVIEW.: I have always been a huge fan of A. Meredith Walters starting with Find You in the Dark. I read Bad Rep last year. I enjoyed it, wasn't over the moon crazy about it, but thought it was a good book. When I heard Perfect Regret was being released I was like... I'll check it out. I love rocker stories so why not. Plus I love Ms Walters work so I thought I would give it a try. I am soooo glad I did. I so loved this book and feel in love with Riley and Garrett's story. I laughed, I cried, I yelled at my kindle and I loved every second of it!Riley Walker comes across as being the know it all snobby bitch that knows what she wants from life. She has a boyfriend, Damien that she is content with and knows what she wants from life when she graduates college. Then Damien does the expected, breaks up with her. On a night of drowning her sorrows, she does something totally unexpected; she has sex with the lead guitarist from Generation Rejects, Garrett Bellows. He is everything that Riley despises. He's in a band, has long hair, drinks too much, and smokes too much. Waking up the next morning she immediately knows she made a huge mistake. She is also conflicted because she has a calmness with him never had with Damien. He makes her feel something Damien never did."I should have been relieved that our secret rendezvous would remain a secret. But relief wasn't what I was feeling. And I refused to admin to myself that I was disappointment that fluttered in my stomach"Weeks go by and the two dance around each other like nothing happen until Riley's world is turned upside down. The one that is there for her is the one that is least expected. Garrett is there to help her through one of the hardest times in her life."But there was something in the way I felt with Garrett that took me out of my comfort zone and thrust me, without preamble, into the cold, hard world of lust and want. "I thought for sure she would see the light and she would not judge him for what's on the outside. But no... she still continues to fight against what she feels and chalks it up to being over emotional and he just happens to be there for her. We start to see a side of Garrett that no one else sees. He puts up a front and does not allow others to see in to the true Garrett, except for Riley."The guy who until a month ago, I wanted nothing to do with but now had slithered his way under my skin. He was like a freaking parasite, sucking away everything but the desire to get him naked"Will Riley wake up and see that even though Garrett has this exterior that she would never normally be with? Can she accept the feeling of happiness that she feels when she is around him? Or will Damien her ex-boyfriend come back and try to win her heart back? Damien is like her, they want the same things but is she content with being comfortable? It's a fabulous story of love and the unexpected with some twist and turns that will have your heart break in two but then but back together to have it melt into a big pile of mush!!! I loved every minute it!"I never expected that the one person I had declared to have no place in my life, to be my one great regret, to fit so perfectly that it was as though he had always been there"
$SUMMARY.: Loved every second of it!

$review_text.: Author Parry has a fine gift for description.  The first 15% of the book was given over to detailed descriptions of protagonist's arrival at Gran's, the minutiae of the house and the cooking, and long vivid descriptions of the surrounding area and the abandoned lead mines and mining procedures.At 17% I nearly quit reading (from a surfeit of descriptive prose), but that's when things started to happen and I'm glad that I persevered, because it was an enjoyable book.  At first the dialog was quited stilted, but it smoothed out by halfway through.  The author uses the subjunctive--quite elegantly--but she needs to learn how one is formed from regular verbs.  In addition, would someone please tell her that the expression is "all right" not "alright"?  Thank you.At times the plot's action was a bit difficult to follow, but overall it was quite imaginative and plausible.  I'll be looking for more (and improved) from this author.

$review_text.: Move over Harry Potter and the Twilight series. The next big thing in young adult fantasy is here with the debut novel in Jason Letts' Powerless series entitled "The Synthesis.""The Synthesis" is a coming of age and underdog story of of fifteen year old Mira Ipswitch, who must navigate and succeed in a world in which everyone is given a special power but her. Using her common sense, problem solving skills, and knowledge of mathematics and machinery, Mira is able to compete in the senior level class at Dustfalls Academy with other teens her age who have special powers such as the ability use gravitational force, singing to brain wash people, and exuding abnormal amounts of heat. Mira is an excellent role model for teen and tween girls and boys alike.It is a bumpy ride for Mira, who was sheltered in her childhood home for her first fifteen years by a cloud of mist courtesy of her father Kevin. After homeschooling and no social interaction with other children, she must introduce and befriend students who had known each other since the age of five all while finding a way to stay competitive without a power. Author Jason Letts does a great job in portraying a real teenage girl who stumbles sometimes in her navigation of this new environment, making poor choices, and then working to correct them.The cast of characters surrounding Mira on the first leg of her journey are all unique and three dimensional. Each character brings something to the story, making it better and more intriguing with their presence. The array of special powers is astounding. Mira's father, Kevin, can create a mist to protect himself and others. Mira's mother, Jeana, can make someone fall asleep. A neighbor, Mert Bogger, doesn't need to breathe. The special powers alone are a testament to the author's imagination and a sign of the amazing things to come in future installments of the Powerless series.I cannot say enough positive things about Jason Letts' debut novel. It is an enchanting and well written story that young adults and adults alike will be able to enjoy reading over and over again.

She also praises divorcees, like if  a broken family  was special and good for the children. Stop lying Ms Newman.Satan has deluded millions of people into believing the lie that homosexuality is nothing but an alternative lifestyle and that society can redefine marriage as it pleases, and feed these lies to our children. But this will bring consequences. Remember what happened in the days of Lot.

$REVIEW.: This booklet is well written and easy to read


 It is a quick read and I enjoyed it
 The author's stories about her grandmother were very interesting and enlightening.The advice in this book is basic advice - it might be common sense to some, but if you are feeling overwhelmed and snowed under, this might be just the perfect place to start


 This book will give you a blueprint to work from in order to change your life


 The author offers simple steps to help you get your chaos and anxiety under control.All of the advice in this book is good, solid advice
 If you follow it, you will see positive improvement


 The only slight drawback to this book is that it more of an over view than a detailed plan

 You may find you start with this book and then get a second, more in depth book to help you with the details [such as "Sink Reflections" or "Confessions of an Organized Housewife".]This book is well worth the purchase price though - it is motivational and a great place to start if you are trying to get your life organized!

$review_text.: Long Life?: A Journey into the Unknown World of CryonicsI enjoyed this book and also wanted to call your attention to another, a courtroom thriller about cryonics called Long Life?Long Life? tells the story of cryonics expert Dr. Rebecca Adler, who agrees to freeze the body of a virile, 34-year-old AIDS patient. She sets off a controversy that cuts across science, religion, ethics and the law. Her case serves as the touchstone and focal point for Long Life?, Phoenix attorney Robert Begam's second novel.To help her patient, a physicist who has contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion, Adler performs a "pre-mortem" suspension, putting the patient into a cryonic state before he has been declared legally dead. The physicist requests the procedure to protect his body from the ravages of AIDS. He is convinced that, after a cure is found, he will be reanimated to live a rich, full life. The Maricopa County attorney's office sees the matter differently. Chief prosecutor Scott Novak files first-degree murder charges and seeks the death penalty for Adler, and a fascinating novel is off and running.Adler and her cryonics institute, the for-profit Omega Terrace of North Scottsdale, Ariz., engage famed New York trial lawyer Joe Purcell to represent her. He hesitates to get involved in what appears to be a lost cause. Finally he agrees because, as he says, "This will be the first murder case in which there is only one issue: Is the victim dead?"If you're interested in these issues, and you love a good page turner, you'll find this to be a fascinating, enjoyable read.

$review_text.: This review can be found at The Armchair Reader.Still harboring bitterness toward his high school bully, Isaac Jones, Rafi is flabbergasted when Isaac stumbles across him and acts like they're long lost friends. While Rafi just wants to get as far away from Isaac as possible, Isaac has something else in mind, a secret he's been keeping since they went to school together. Determination doesn't even begin to describe Isaac when he'll do whatever it takes to win Rafi over once and for all.At first, Rafi is standoffish and borderline rude to Isaac. It was interesting to see how angry Rafi was towards Isaac even twelve years after the fact. As the story progresses, Rafi melts to Isaac's charms, which was definitely entertaining! Isaac, on the other hand, is persistent and will do anything (even breaking and entering) to worm his way into Rafi's life and heart. It was funny to see Isaac think what he was doing was okay when it was obvious Rafi hated Isaac being there. I found Isaac just so adorable. He's a bit of a stalker and slightly obsessed but this big, tall guy that wasn't afraid of anything was afraid of Rafi's rejection BUT even when Rafi did reject him, he kept coming back and breaking down Rafi's walls until Rafi admitted defeat.If you haven't already guessed, this story revolves around forgiveness. Rafi is very hurt by how Isaac used to treat him. However, as the story evolves, you realize that Rafi's view on everything isn't exactly the whole picture. What you come to realize is that Isaac might have said some mean things to Rafi but his actions were quite different. Rafi remembers Isaac as this mean, cruel bully but as it's remembers (sans flashbacks thankfully!), he's portrayed as this hero. Constantly saving Rafi from getting injured or hurting himself more than his klutziness already has. It's sweet in a way but it's obvious that Rafi was a little oblivious to this because of his focus on Isaac's words instead of his actions.The story had a lot of potential but I think, considering the length of the book, it didn't exactly live up to that potential. While entertaining and enjoyable, I felt like some things were rushed or even were easy platitudes considering the situation. For instance, the resolution to Isaac coming out was nice but we don't actually see it put into action so that felt too `easy,' IMO. I felt like Rafi also caved too early to Isaac's pursuits. Rafi was basing his forgiveness off Isaac's sexual prowess instead of actually making Isaac grovel in a nonsexual way, which had me a bit sad because it would have been funny seeing Isaac doing whatever Rafi wanted without hesitation. I'm not usually one to get hung up on endearments but I didn't like Isaac calling Rafi `boo' it kept making me feel like Rafi was just a one-night stand that Isaac would forget in the morning. While that is obviously NOT the case, I couldn't help feel like it wasn't appropriate to who Rafi was to Isaac. Aside from that, Rafi had a tendency to think of Isaac as `Isaac Jones' as if he was still in awe over Isaac, which got slightly annoying towards the end of the book and even though he was in love and comfortable around Isaac, he still considered him as `Isaac Jones.' Lastly, I wished there had been some scenes of Isaac meeting Rafi's friends or vice versa just to show that these two are serious because, unfortunately, most of the scenes of them together consist of them in Rafi's apartment (more specifically his bedroom).Overall, this was a very cute short story. It's light-hearted and liable to give you a silly little smile. The characters were amusing and their journey to forgiveness was entertaining. I really wish this book had been much longer, though, because I feel like a little more groveling on Isaac's part was needed but other than that, it's a good story for someone who's looking for something light and sweet.

She didn't cut corners or hold back from the truths and temptations teens face today but embraced them with grace and class and realism, making it impossible for a teen to read this story and not face some hard questions about themselves. I highly recommend for any teen girl, whether "troubled" or not. The spiritual thread was done so well, it never felt preachy or "in your face" but rather encouraging and hopeful for teens looking for answers from above :)  I can't wait to go back and read the first in this series, and am wishing the third was coming out sooner than it is!!

$review_text.: We start off with an assassin who is rather a government operative with license to kill although no James Bond.  The highpoint of the whole book was in the first couple of chapters where the main character, a methane breather, is trying to get his wife out of prison but arrived too late.  The rest of his adventures are basically trying to get his wife's genome from these scientific monk types of another race by exchanging his services.  The rest of the races mentioned are oxygen breathers, a big bad tree dwelling caste society with a huge invulnerable fleet and a civilized water world inward focused peoples.There is very little character development and I found myself not really caring who lives and who dies.  Some of the action sequences are imaginative but on the whole, the book left me empty.  The main character by the way spends most of his time in another race's body sharing it with the owner.  This could have been quite interesting but the author didn't seem to want to develop a relationship.  By the way, I received this book free in exchange for an unbiased review.

$REVIEW.: Kelly is a 36 year old widow with two tween boys
Andrew is a 29 year old A-list actor

 But when they meet in Boise, Idaho (really?) the sparks fly.Or they should


But really, it felt like a slow, steady, dripping thing--like Chinese water torture


Kelly was SO lacking in self confidence and SO self-deprecating, and CONSTANTLY asked, &#34;What is he doing with me?&#34; that I was wondering, too--WTH was he doing with her?I found this story really unbelievable
It was more like a 36 year old's fantasy than a realistic story of something that might actually happen

And not just because she wasn't famous and he was
Or because he was totally fit and she was a size 10
Or he was 29 and she was 36


Or he was ridiculously attractive and she was kinda ok
Or he lived in L.A

and she lived in Idaho.It was ALL these things
But they all could have been overcome if she had any sense of SELF
Or was confident and funny...SOMETHING!But she, like the story, was meandering and slow to action

I forced myself to finish it, hoping it would improve.Mostly I was just relieved when it was over.Massive waste of time.

$review_text.: The plot of this book is like none I have ever read. Strange relationships that are all someway connected. You spend half the book trying to decide who you like...who she should choose. Then the story takes a drastic twist and it's all over. The decision is made, and the story is rushed. If you want hot and steamy...this book has that in spades. Just felt like the ending was a bit rushed. And the epilouge....ugh!

I recently moved from my 1890's two-family into a 1960's split level ranch and my father quickly &#34;borrowed&#34; my copy to add to his arsenal of information/ help on his house that was built in the 1850s.

$review_text.: Okay, I gave this two weeks before I reviewed it just to see if the methods actually worked. They more than work. They have changed my life and my family! I am SO grateful to these authors.I was an abused kid. It has taken years for me to be able to admit this. I wasn't spanked often. I was hit in the face. I was thrown against a wall and grabbed by the throat. This didn't happen lots mind you, it was random. I have happy memories of my dad. And terrible ones. The terror filled moments are rare. I can count them on one hand. But they are vivid. The psychological torment wasn't constant either. But it happened more often than I would like to admit.I rediscovered the teachings of my Catholic faith about 6 years ago, and committed myself to Christ and what I believe to be his Church. (Please don't attack me here... this is just a review of a good book). My father was a liberal who had no faith, who used drugs and wrote bad poetry and didn't work as was bad tempered. My mom's Catholic faith presented many many answers to the questions I was having.The reason I bring this up is that, like most of you may know, the Catholic Church has teachings on contraception that my wife and I took seriously as we became deeply committed Catholic Christians.As we started having children (the logical outgrowth of Catholic marriage) I knew enough to keep a close eye on myself. I read the conservative Catholic books on the topic of discipline because I heard these authors on EWTN. People whom I still love and respect, like Steve Wood and Ray Guarendi, advocated and endorsed spanking for certain misbehaviors, as they contended that both Scripture and Tradition supported that stance. In fact, they seemed to imply, there was something wrong with those who didn't spank.Spanking tore me up inside. I felt like puking. I cried. It brought back horrible memories. I knew enough to know that I had to get help. I got therapy.My therapist was great... but was a conservative Catholic, like me... I wouldn't go to a guy who would look at me like I was crazy because I rejected artificial contraception. I found a good and faithful Catholic therapist. In between marathon session about my anxiety and my childhood (which were SO helpful... really.. I owe that guy my life) he tried to reassure me about spanking. "Have you read Steve Wood?" he asked... "yes... yes... of course" my answer. "You can't equate a spanking with being thrown against a wall and beaten. You are not your father."  "Yes, yes... of course" was my answer. I didn't feel it though. That part about spanking is the only part of my therapy that didn't help.Spanking wasn't working. For my oldest daughter, it worked great. I only ever spanked her once or twice in her life, and that was enough. My son (who is our middle child) was a different story. The spankings were not decreasing in frequency. It wasn't working. I was an emotional and spiritual wreck.My youngest daughter... the third... was just plain too happy to take any discipline seriously. I am not kidding. She laughed through time outs. Laughed one minute after a spanking. Smiled and kissed us and kept doing whatever she was doing. She is the happiest kid I have ever seen... and she just didn't care about our consequences.Our children were never out of control, were relatively well behaved, and were very respectful. Overall they were happy. But I was not. I just knew in my heart that my children were not getting the dad they deserved. The dad I never had.I prayed about it and asked God to send me a faithful answer that would help me be a better husband and father. This is part of the prayer I pray every night. "Please Lord, help me be the father and husband you made me to be."I found this book while browsing on my Kindle and bought it. I read it and after getting through about 10% of it thought to myself "this is garbage." I had read criticisms of "counting" before, and I was upset by the tone of the book. For the first 10% or more of the text you really don't learn anything at all. It is an anti-spanking tirade. I got through it with effort. I was open to what this book had to say. That is why I bought it. The first 10% or so is just overkill. Still, even with this weakness, the book is so life transforming that I have to give it five stars.FINALLY, I got to the system, and I found it intriguing. I began trying it out. I sat my kids down and met with them and explained the system and said "I don't like spanking, and neither do you. I don't think it is working. It is making me unhappy and you unhappy. Mommy and Daddy are going to do something different."I let my wife know what I was reading and said that I wanted her to try it; that I thought we should do this together. She happily agreed.So began our journey about three weeks ago. The transformation has been amazing. The kids are listening better than before by a long shot, and my blood-pressure goes up MUCH less frequently. Emotionally, I am SO MUCH happier I can't even tell you. I feel healthy, and hole as a parent for the first time in a long time. I have been working on this for years. My oldest is now six, my youngest two (we have three). This system just plain works! It works better than spanking. My youngest is actually listening!! It is AMAZING. (Once you slog past that first 10% of the book).My children are so happy. Just tonight we were out for our nightly walk and my oldest turned to me and said "I am so happy there are no spankings anymore. You don't yell as much either." She said this matter of factly. I was so happy I nearly cried. It is working. Therapy, this book, and constant effort and prayer are paying off.Please... buy this book. I will never be one of those extremists who equates spanking with child abuse. That is offensive. I know what first hand child abuse really is. If all I ever had to endure as a kid was an occasional spanking I would be grateful beyond measure. Dr. Ray Guarendi and Steve Wood and Dr. Dobson all make great points. Please.... I am not an extremist. Go see the reviews of these authors books and you will find anti-spanking extremists who never read their work giving them one star reviews. It is terrible. Spanking is NOT child abuse.But this system works way better for me and my family. For my family it has been life transforming. Because of my family background, it has given me my life back.In closing I thank God for professional psychologists who have a deep and abiding faith in God, like the author of this book, and my therapist, and so many others who seek to make sure that the Body of Christ is whole mentally and spiritually. What a gift, and what a vocation.I AM saying that this system WORKS, and for me, it has given me my life back. With my background, spanking was destroying me. This book allows me to retain my parental authority without raking me with guilt and pain.That is worth five stars any day.Addenda (1/23/10):I wanted to add this addenda now that I have been living with this system for some time. I recently readThe Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Rightand I learned something of use when implementing 123 magic.I suggest coming up with a simple "discipline checklist" based on this system. Print it out and post it in the parts of your house where you most often interact with the kids. Whenever you are faced with a behavior you need to stop, run the checklist based on 123 Magic.This has been an essential piece of staying on track for me. Old habits die hard, and kids LOVE to test, especially when you are trying something new. They will push hard to get you back into your old habits. They are like routine sponges, getting into groves and staying there, and resisting any attempt to switch tactics.  We as adults are the same way.My advice is to create a checklist based on this system and run it. If after a week you think it needs tweaking, go back and tweak the checklist and rehang it. The key here is to have (and force yourself to use) the checklist for consistency. It also helps to reread sections of the book when your feel yourself being pulled off track.The one problem with how the book is written is that it a) is repetitive, b) begins with a tirade that doesn't teach you much, and c) when you get to the system is not structured as logically and sequentially as I would like. It is still a five star book, but the reader can go a long way to making up for these shortcomings by creating a good checklist.

$REVIEW.: I'm very glad to have this book, having wondered for years when such awork would see the light of day.I did find it somewhat superficial, at the same time, very difficult to read
Reviewer Stanley H


said it right, the prose is entangled in repetitious sportsisms, if you will: for example, the overuse of the word "bigs" for, guess what, "the big leagues"

Gotta say, I've never heard/read that expression in about 50 years of Baseball viewing

Another problem is with time frames - is it 1953 or 1957?Sometimes, though, we do get that sun playing off the mid-day, mid-May mid-'50s metalworks of the Yankee Stadium batting cage, when the words of The Voice are quoted, which certainly suggests this writer takes his subject very seriously and has possibly accessed very hard-to-find kinescopes, or audiocassetttes, etc
Another plus are the many rare photos....yep, they brought me back.My Dad hated...was anti-Yankee without a doubt...didn't like the layout of the ol' Ball Yard in the Bronx...didn't dig those characters winning every single year! But he did love Mel Allen


Wrote to the poweres-that-be to bring him back.Hey Curt, thanks for that memory - "How about that?!".

I couldn't wait for it to end....I felt like there was no beginning or end....it seemed liked the book started in the middle...there was no back story and I felt it ended the same way....in the middle...I know this was a short story but the key word is story....which this wasn't much of one..... I am one of those readers that once I start a book good or bad I have to finish it .......so because it was a short book and it only took about an hour to finish and although I can never get that hour back it could have been longer so for that alone I give this book two stars instead of the one star it deserves in my opinion

$review_text.: In this novella, Sara Shepard tells the story of the summer before when Sutton is chasing after Thayer - all in the name of a prank for The Lying Game. What starts out as a prank ends up with Sutton feeling true feelings for Thayer, even though she convinces her friends it's just a prank.I've only read the first two books in the Lying Game series. I've read a little about Sutton and Thayer's history and I was interested in finding out what happened to them. Their story unfolds in The First Lie.I like that we saw a softer side to Sutton as she starts to fall for Thayer, and not just as part of a prank. She even admits to herself that she thinks the Lying Game goes too far.  We really see the darker side of Sutton in the first two books in The Lying Game and it's great to have a story from Sutton's perspective with her emotions.I'm hooked on this series and I can't wait to dig into book 3.

 Aiden was everything you have come to expect - arrogant, self centered and HOT and Pete was the same ol country boy with a big heart and jealous nature
 Daisy was the suprise to me in this book

 She def showed a lot of growth and I actually started to like and sympathize with her (I never did in the other two books)
 The family drama was is spades, but the love story between Daisy and Aiden is so beautiful!  Must buy!

$REVIEW.: Seeing as yesterday was hockey's version of the Super Bowl, with the Winter Classic (even though I'm a Blackhawks fan, I did have to cheer on the NY Rangers with fellow Rochester, NY native, Ryan Callahan), I thought it appropriate to read a hockey story.  And this one did not disappoint!Kyla is an overachieving, overworked lawyer trying to make partner at her law firm.  She sacrifices everything, even outings with her family, in order to prove to the old boys network that she's worthy of partner.  But maternal guilt and resentment of her treatment at work have her throwing her suitcase together and driving to the families lakeside cottage for a week vacation with her family and their cloth family friends, the neighbors the Hellers.Kyla has thought of all the Heller brothers as an extension of her family, with the exception of Tag.  He was her teenage crush that went no where.  But seeing him again has stirred up all those teenage feelings and hormones into a woman's lust filled cravings of a boy who has grown into a seriously hot man.  Kyla fights her feelings, while sneaking peeks at Tag, but keeps reminding herself that her life is her job and making partner and messing around with Tag won't get her anywhere.Tag, burned by women who only see him as a hockey player and the size of his wallet, has the same reaction to Kyla.  But he doesn't get serious with women anymore and he's afraid Kyla's brother would beat the crap out of him for even touching their sister.  But Tag's not as good as Kyla in fighting his feelings for her and convinces Kyla that a week long fling isn't such a bad idea.Kyla and Tag are hot together.  She doesn't shy away from his kinky bag of tricks (literally) and sees Tag the man.  Tag shows Kyla how to have fun, both inside and outside of the tent, and what's been missing in her life as she wastes away inside the four walls of her law firm.  Despite their vows that this week together was just a fling, you can see how each of them fight their feelings for each other and that when the week ends, neither of them are going to be happy.The story was enjoyable and a way to escape to those summer months where you long to be lazy and to let loose.

$REVIEW.: Thoughts while reading Blue Skies...I had one main train of thought the whole way through reading this book, and that was, our actions can affect others. In this life we live, we can only be responsible for how we act and how we react to others around us. But in those actions, other people are often affected. Kind of made me think twice (or make a mental note to think twice) with decisions and changes I implement in life around me - as it will always affect other people - for good or bad - and that is always an unknown.Blue Skies is a brilliant book by Fleur McDonald, I literally could not put it down! It had mystery, intrigue, fear, history, courage and love wrapped up in a page turning saga.

$REVIEW.: This is really a good book because it lets you see what was behind the activities of the European theatre. One usually just gets a rather bland overview of the  men involved. This one however, lets you get into his thinking and his point of view. He has been much maligned because of his caustic temper. And yes, he had one but a lot of his problems were the higher commanders who would not or could not understand what was going on in the field. He saw it from ground level and the way the book is written makes you feel you are with him. I find him absolutely fascinating - tough, strong and yet there is an element of humanness underneath it all. A very good read for those that are interested in the real men of World War II.

$REVIEW.: I've long been fascinated by Barbara Payton, and not just because I'm a red-blooded male thoroughly entranced by her head-to-toe lusciousness and incomparable sex appeal
 No, it's more than that
 I've loved two women in my life who were, and no doubt still are, very much as she was (one of whom I came within a hair's breadth of marrying)

 What I perceived in them, with sadness and helplessness, Barbara (if I may be so bold) had in spades -- the shattered glass house, the dark and broken mirror, of a life; the neo-pagan and nihilistic hedonism; the frantic and pointless obsession with base sensation in general and tawdry sex in particular; and the futile effort to fill, or at least numb, with alcohol the dimly perceived and depthless emptiness.Hat's off to John O'Dowd for his excellent "Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye"


 The story is very well researched, and the writing and editing are good enough

 I must say, though, that I was taken aback by his "...Barbara's professional and personal reputations in Hollywood had been irreparably damaged and were now pretty much beyond repair [page 311]."  Well, as long as there's no redundancy, Mr

O'Dowd, that's the main thing


 But he made up for it by quoting a line from "Confidential" that cracked me up:  "'...the liveliest tour of his [Bob Hope's] life began when saucy Barbara Payton came for cocktails -- and stayed for capers [page 312]!'"  It's supposed to be suggestive, I know, but it's really quite inept.A minor issue here and there

 It's well-nigh incredible, for instance, that O'Dowd wasn't able to come up with anything regarding Barbara's fifth and final marriage

 But the one area in which the author failed miserably, and I was very much surprised by this, is in his barely addressing (indeed, hardly mentioning) Barbara's ostensible lesbianism

 Did she, for example, engage in a sapphic threesome, much to Frank Sinatra's dismay and disgust, with Ava Gardner and Lana Turner?  I of course don't know if Barbara "enjoyed" lesbian encounters (regardless of what she claims in "I Am Not Ashamed")


 But, as I've said, I've intimately known women of Barbara's type -- women for whom sex is little more than an itch that just about anyone can scratch -- and they were anything but strangers to lesbianism
 One, for instance, is a loving mother who looks forward to tucking her young son into bed
 When her husband's not around, however, she indulges in bar hopping, seeking both men and women for perverse romps in dingy motel rooms.And speaking of motherly love...all respect to John Lee Payton, but I think he protests too much

 Regardless of his touching love for Barbara, a mother who allows her seven-year-old son to witness orgies is, by definition, a bad mother

 The fact that she so permitted overwhelms and negates whatever dubious maternal attributes she may have had.It only remains for me to express the wish that O'Dowd will one day write similar biographies of similar starlets -- Gail Russell, Yvette Vickers, and Lila Leeds come most immediately to mind
 And, sadly, there are so many others, such as Simone Silva, Gia Scala, and Inger Stevens.

$REVIEW.: This book is one of the most touching books that I have read in a long time! Simone's experience is remarkable in many ways. She was a little girl when she was faced with one of the most difficult situations a human being can experience. She was separated from both her parents and taken to a &#34;re education&#34; center where she was supposed to realize that her beliefs were wrong and accept that she could have a better life if only she rejected her faith. The way she faced that, is a testimony to the Bible education she received at home and a strong proof that even when you are that young you can remain loyal to your faith under the most excruciating circumstances.

$REVIEW.: Jaime has several strengths as a vocal coach and teacher. One thing I really appreciate is that not only does he give clear instructions, but he also provides the reasoning behind each of his techniques. Sure, he uses imagery as other teachers do, but you get a real sense of "I do a,b,c and d,e and f will happen to my voice.As a speech therapist in training I recognise that voice quality really is an extension of an individuals health. This book respects this truth and, while somewhat brief, provides techniques and incentives to boost your health.The results are immediate and invigorating. If you are not familiar with Jaime's products this would be an excellent introduction due to it's low price. Give this a read, give the technique a go (yes you have to work!) and let the unavoidable results and progress inspire you to delve deeper into your voice training.

$REVIEW.: I came across this book and was quite intrigued by the title. I had heard of James W. Pennebaker while readingRedirect: The Surprising New Science of Psychological Changeand this book simply-titled "The Secret Life of Pronouns" is such a fascinating reading.This book contains ten chapters with an appendix, and that appendix is entitled "A Handy Guide for Spotting and Interpreting Function Words in the Wild" to which one can rip it off the book and use it on a daily basis (really, I do not like debasing any book, so I just photo-copy it and kept it on my person). The writing is very clear and coherent, not too shabby for a book of this nature, with many real-life examples. It's clearly a book about languages and how it reflects one's personalities. Specifically, the author did pointed out that languages do not change one's personality, but merely reflects it. By writing down everything, one can look back and see the "person" behind the words and understand one's own emotional states. It's a self-reflection and how one "projects" to others through their words.Personally, it's an extremely interesting book about spoken and written languages and how they reveal things about ourselves. Previously, I didn't care about pronouns, verbs, nouns, or articles as they're all Greek to me since I am a hard-of-hearing, but now this book prompts me to research further on the subject of language and how I use my words for myself and towards others. There is even a website for this, which I'll endeavor onto the tests and learn more about myself as a writer and as a human being.

One thing that stood out to me was when she said that even when we mess up or don't listen, God still keeps trying to reach us. The other is that no matter what, don't ever stop praying. God hears every single one, but sometimes the answer is not yet, or no I have something better in store for you. I believe every Christian will be inspired by this book as they see what happens when you trust God completely.

$REVIEW.: ***I received an ARC of this book for an honest review***Sarah is a sweet and very shy young women who has had to deal with both her adopted parents dying just months apart when she was 18 and being left alone. She has no other family and grew up very sheltered out of the public eye.Colt he's really the whole package, former Army Ranger, sexy as hell alpha who goes after what he wants, he's caring, thoughtful, and a loving family man. He would do anything for Sarah even try to find her birth parent but, looking into Sarah's past turns her life upside down, the things that they dig up make her question everything that she has known up to now.The twists and turns this book took was crazy! It shows how much Colt and Sarah loved one another and to what lengths Colt was willing to go to protect her. I was gasping as I read this book. It was a great book to read, one that I highly enjoyed and recommend.I give this book 5 out of 5 stars!!!!Reviewed by Ashley G

$REVIEW.: I received an ARC from the author for an honest review.I had a smile on my face the entire time I was reading this. That was how much I enjoyed reading about Ed and Colin.K.C. Wells did a marvelous job creating two characters that were absolutely perfect together while being different enough that they were unsure that their feelings would be returned.Ed is loud, brash and a bit uncouth. A big, rough and tough rugby player with a soft core he is above all else a good man and a loyal friend. He is surprisingly and refreshingly open to his changing perceptions about himself. When he has problems he goes to his friends for advice then he listens to them.Colin is not in the closet but he has not felt the need to announce anything to the team. He is quieter than Ed, but when push comes to shove Colin has, to quote a character in the book, &#34;Balls of brass.&#34;While there is a secondary plot with a villain in the latter part of the book, most of the tension in this story is from two men walking a tightrope of emotions. Each man is trying to figure out just what the other means to him. Then when he realizes just how he feels, each man hopes that he means just as much to the other.This will be one of my go to books for when I need a book with characters that make me smile and a romance that gives me the warm fuzzies........And I need to mention the hot, HOT sex because Whew!!...I now have a major thing rugby players

$REVIEW.: Having been involved with groups connected to the Zen Mountain Monastery, I have an eye towards Zen at times, although I've been drawn to the Gurdjieff Work. The ten ox herding pictures have always spoken to me. Even to the non Zen practice I do now, many of the teachings here still apply. I especially like the point Loori makes about arriving at a plateau where the practitioner has to go through an exhaustive inquiry into every aspect of their life. I also like the circular nature of the pictures. Moment by moment, observing oneself, one may go through all ten stages, or in sittings.Excellent work.
$SUMMARY.: Just like Zen, short and to the point

$review_text.: Some of the narrative was quite nice.  Much of the dialogue, however, was stilted, lacking an easy flow.That could have been dismissed had the hero been heroic.  The heroine was dead, dying, or in great peril at the least, and he sat on his duff and waited for Bow Street to track her down.  Not my kind of hero.The "hero" issue is just a matter of personal preference, of course, and the dialogue will become more fluid with time.  The author definitely shows promise and I will be back.Note to editor:  Please.  It's "genteel," not "gentile."  A little jarring, that.

$review_text.: My Thoughts:Creatively clever story!  The characters are incredible.  Asler Kiis, although an alien, is the man we all wish we had, of course we wish this deep down inside and don't tell.  He is everything a person can be in all ways: physically attractive, mentally gifted, emotionally stable, and psychologically secure.  Susan Branscombe is the tough, rugged, patriotic, independent, dedicated woman we all try our best to be as often as we can.  That she is damaged both physically and mentally from being tortured is what brings her into contact with Kiis, and then opens her up to the opportunity to learn more about both herself and him (also the possibility of a relationship beyond just sex).  The physical characteristics of the Inarri are described in such detail that I found myself seeing vivid pictures as I read the story.The setting is mainly on space crafts of one kind or another and the technology on-board is the stuff of a gifted imagination.  During the mind joining sessions between Susan and Kiis, we are shown glimpses into the world of the Inarri which is described so well that it is easy for the reader to keep the movie-like picture of the story going. We are also given small bits about where Susan is from, but only in a broad spectrum kind of way.The storyline is one of a science fiction action adventure meets hot alien romance!  The styles of the aliens compared with the human military are what I imagine they would truly be if there were aliens.  It was easy for me to invest myself in the plot.*The story was well done all the way around.  This was a one sitting read for me - I couldn't put it down!  I loved the ending and can hardly wait for more books in this series!

$REVIEW.: Bake Through The BibleAuthor: Susie Bentley-Taylor and Bekah MoorePublisher: The Good Book CompanyPublished: 2013Pages: 63Source: Thank you to the publisher for a complimentary copy which I received for a fair and honest review.Genre:  Children's cookbookISBN: 9781909559004Amazon: Paperback $11.75This great resource starts with a couple of pages that show you how to use the book to get the most out of it for your little one.  Bake through the Bible is a great way to get your child taking about God and some of the great stories from Genesis to Revelation.Each "lesson" or activity starts with a scripture and a quick story covered in that scripture.  The ingredients and instructions follow and also give you some talking points while you cook.  Through out there are symbols that let you know when maybe an adult should do this particular step and clocks to show time needed for the step.  In the back of the book they give you a website to get some more downloadable resources such as scripture tags to print.Here are the titles:1. Creation (Genesis 1)2. God's people disobey Him (Genesis 3)3. God makes amazing promises (Genesis 12 & 15)4. God's people grow (Genesis 18 & 21)5. God rescues His people (Exodus 7-15)6. God shows us how to live (Exodus 20)7. God gives His people a home (Joshua 5&6)8. God looks after His people (Psalm 23)9. God promises a Forever - King (2 Samuel 7)10. God promises a Rescuer ( Isaiah 53)11. The birth of Jesus (Luke 1 & 2)12. The shepherds and the star (Luke 2 & Matthew 2)13. Jesus feeds thousands ( Mark 6 vs 30-44)14. Jesus calms the storm (Luke 8 vs 22-25)15. Jesus can open blind eyes ( Luke 18 vs 35-43)16. Jesus dies (Mark 15)17. Jesus lives (Luke 24 vs 1-12)18. Jesus gives His friends a job (Matt 28 & Acts 1)19. Jesus can make dirty hearts clean (Acts 22)20. God's new creation (Revelation 19 & 21)I truly enjoyed this little book and I will be saving it to use with my grandchildren someday (that really isn't that far off)!

$REVIEW.: I'm a little unsure how I feel after finishing Spiraling. Let me start by saying I love Rachel's style and there are aspects of this story that I really enjoyed.From the moment they meet, it is impossible not to see the immense and immediate sexual chemistry between Amy and Shane. You know it won't be long before they find their way into each other's beds. Boy howdy, this book is HOT! Spicy hot with the sexytimes. While I hadn't quite been expecting that level of heat, I was totally on board with it. As I said when I reviewed Rock Her last year, the way Rachel Cross incorporates the intimate scenes into the story never gives you the feeling that they are there purely for voyeuristic or titillation purposes. The physical connection between these two is quite intense, so for Amy and Shane to disappear behind closed doors would have been totally out of place.I loved the fact that the author chose to write these two as incredibly flawed and imperfect people with deep-seated issues. We do tend to install the well-known among us on pedestals of perfection, so it is good to see a bit of reality reflected.Unfortunately, it was the extent of their personal issues and the actions of some of the characters that made it a little difficult for me to believe in a happy-ever-after for them. There was so much going on in this book, so much drama, that I often found myself feeling a little drained. Don't get me wrong, a lot of the goings-on were integral to their story, but maybe there didn't need to be quite so much of it. I think that it was because of all that was going on around them, I just didn't quite connect with the emotional side of their romance.I really did want to enjoy Spiraling more than I did, as I really enjoyed the previous books in the series.My rating: 3 out of 5 (I had originally graded it 2.5, but the writing style pushed it back up for me)Note: I was provided with an advanced reader copy of this book by Crimson Romance via NetGalley in return for an honest review.
$SUMMARY.: The earlier books in the series were stronger for me

$review_text.: I'm a big fan of Temple Grandin's books, and couldn't wait to pick this one up. It's the first time I've been disappointed.This book contains a lot of fascinating information and insight, both about autism and about the rules that govern "neurotypical" social life.  There's nothing like having an outsider's perspective - "beginner's mind" - to realize all the things you take for granted.My disappoinment, though, lies in the book's very sloppy editing.  Spelling and grammatical errors pop out at least every 3 pages or so.  Stylistically, much of the writing reads like a first draft: stiff, clunky, stilted, and loaded with cliches.  The potential for good writing is there, if only a judicious editor had been around to help clean up the mistakes and suggest stylistic improvements.  I don't expect a Thackeray or Joan Didion here, but the persistent grammatical & spelling errors distract severely from the content.Interestingly, Temple Grandin's segments (the book is written in three voices, Dr. Grandin's, Mr. Barron's, and their editor's) are by far the best written of anything in the book.  This surprised me, since she is such a visual thinker and has written in the past about her difficulty with language.  It just goes to show that practice makes perfect: even an incredibly non-verbal thinker like Temple Grandin has, over time, perfected a lucid, funny, readable, down-to-earth, straight-shooting yet graceful prose style.
$review_summary.: great content, could have used better editing

$REVIEW.: This book had great information on how to live not just a vegan life but a healthy life. Each chapter talks about a different topic, but typically refers to a specific nutritional need an outlines why our bodies need it and what foods to get it from. There are charts, that include animals product (for comparison), that are extremely helpful in determining which foods have how much of what vitamin or mineral. Even my non-vegan--but health-nut--mom was intrigued by the book. This is also a great starting point for people doing initial research on becoming vegan. Downside: they don't exactly give you a diet plan or recipes, just the information you need to live a healthy vegan life. However, once you have the information and would like to find a recipe/diet book I would recommend "Skinny Bitch" and the companion recipe book.

$review_text.: Pete Sortwell is the kind of risk taker I admire. His series of review books were an original concept that was both funny and entertaining. The Hapless Father series starts with Diary of an Expectant Father and continues with this volume, Diary of a Hapless Father.As the title suggests it consists of a number of diary entries starting from the birth to three months old. I expect more diaries to follow. Sortwell is a prolific writer whose work sometimes polarizes opinions. What he has delivered with this series so far is an interesting blend of the comic, the informative and some sweet aaahh moments. This book was competent, thoughtful and well edited.

$REVIEW.: You almost never see books that are this honest about corporate politics and climbing the corporate ladder, especially from those with first-hand experience in reaching high level corporate positions. Just writing about it brands you as a Machivellian.According to the author, if you want to climb the corporate ladder, you need to do a lot of things well. You need to understand the unwritten rules, make your boss "look good", and have strategic allies. All these things, of course, are well-known. But the author delves further and cogently states that getting to the top takes a breakthrough in the form of mentor/sponsorship from those in powerful positions. Having the right mentor/sponsor who is committed to pulling you up the corporate ladder can not only change your career, but it can also change your life. And most people who reach the top tend to have such corporate mentor/sponsors.The book also spends considerable number of pages specific to MBA graduates. The author walks a fine line between stating that the MBA worthwhile but not quite as worthwhile as MBA graduates think. In other words, the value of MBA is not a golden ticket that many MBA holders want it to be, and yet, MBA is still very valuable and often a prerequisite to higher corporate positions.This book is very well written in a very engaging style. The author is a gifted writer.The book contain many great advice on how to behave and think in the corporate environment. I highly recommend this book.

$REVIEW.: Harry Levin is a Holocaust survivor who works as a scrap metal dealer in Detroit.  When his daughter is killed in a car accident, he goes to Washington DC to identify her body.  He learns that the accident was caused by a German diplomat who was driving drunk and that he has been released and granted immunity.  Enraged, Harry discovers the identity of the man and flies to Munich to hunt him down.  What he finds is a bigger plot that will affect his life and the people around him.Elmore Leonard says in the end of his introduction to this book, that once you read the first chapter, you won't sell this scrap dealer short.  Harry is an amazing detective and his resolve is inspiring!  He's probably the most realistic character you could ask for.  When he starts this manhunt, he goes into it with the blind rage of a father who just lost his daughter.  He questions himself as time goes on and seems to even doubt his ability to do what he feels is right.  Before he can give into those doubts, he's swept up into a plot that could threaten him anyway and so he goes forward, seeing it through till the end.I read this book in a day and a half because I just couldn't put it down.  From page one, it's nothing but action that leaves you dying to know what happens next.  Add in a little dark humor and supporting characters that are just as complex as Harry and you'll find even when the viewpoint switches, you're not left with the feeling that you want to be with Harry all the time.  If all of Peter's books are like this, I think he just found himself a new fan!Thank you to Partners in Crime blog tours and Peter Leonard for the review copy.  It in no way influenced my review.

$REVIEW.: I was so happy that we finally got part 3 but I was a little disappointed with the ending and the length of the book. Im hoping there's a part 4 to shed more light on both Kush & Lyric handling of baby Chance and Kevy & Jaila's new found relationship. Otherwise I really enjoyed part 3. It was a page turner.

$REVIEW.: I enjoyed this one. Eva and Alexander are learning as they go. I was a pissed off that &#34;Xander&#34; kept some things from Eva, while she opened up to him completely. The journey to be happy and content in their relationship has twists and turns that make the story good. I can't wait for the conclusion. I hope they get their HEA!

$review_text.: I chose to read this book because I thought it was going to be about romance but this book has such a beautiful meaning of love, moving on, and life. I fell in love with the character's especially Aimee and of course Cole. A trauma that has haunted Aimee`s  life and trying to survive she tries to manage her relationship with Cole who also has some messy past of his own as well. Overall this book is amazing! And I just couldn't put the book down! So well written! It's my one of my favorites!:)

Just when you thought these two men would get their happy ending,their lives are taken
One without choice and the other because he couldn't live without the other


There is no happy ending but it is a compelling story nonetheless.

$REVIEW.: This is a very cute and well written story.  Let me emphasize the well written part because I am amazed at how many free reads there are that are not written well.  That being said it is very predictable.  Everything that was said and done was totally expected from a romance book.I don't remember what the total page number is, but I know it's a short read.  It's even shorter than I expected though ... the last 12% goes in to an excerpt for another book.

$REVIEW.: Very unusual book.  This story was sort of a Science Fiction, Dark Fantasy Chronicles of Narnia.  Daniel is driving home and after an accident finds himself transported to a strange and alien land.  The cut on his face from the accident leads to the people of the land believing he is their Savior or Prophet..>"The One" who will lead them out from under the hands of the Emperor and his evil ways.Daniel doesn't want anything to do with prophecy or saving a people, all he wants to do is return home to his wife and children.  The cost of helping him is high, and the body count is piling up.  Will helping him bring peace or just death and destruction?  Is Daniel really the One?  I don't know... Unfortunately we don't get all the answers in book one, which really irritated me because I hate waiting for the next book in the series.  Hint, Hint... I really want to read book 2, so please hurry....;)I give this book 3.5 out of 5, not because it wasn't extremely well-written (because it was) or very interesting and pulled you in (because it was and it did) but because it often felt disjointed as it jumped from Naphthali or Daniel's former life and because we were left with more questions than answers at the end.  I'm greatly looking forward to reading more about Daniel and Naphthali in coming books.This product or book may have been distributed for review; this in no way affects my opinions or reviews.http://www.amazon.com/The-Prophecy-Chronicles-Foretold-ebook/dp/B009TF67FO/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-text&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1364887371&sr;=1-2&keywords;=prophecy+foretold

$review_text.: I am a huge fan of William Gaines, Mad Magazine and his EC comics from the early 50's - before congress censored them. They are beautiful drawn, and, even more significant, extremely well written stories.  "Two Fisted Tales" are generally war stories, but with more than just explosions and other violence. So glad Russ Cochran re-published these great, fun works in stunning volumes.

$review_text.: I did not love this book. I found it very hard to get into. I did not have any empathy for the heroine and hero. The heroine was too guarded for my taste, and the hero was too arrogant and cocky. THe sister and brother of the main characters I found to be very manipulative. The heroine I could sort of understand because of her past, but the hero seemed high and mighty. Very disappointed until the end, when her reasons were revealed. In reality, who would lie and shield their siblings that much. I wanted to shake dimitiri and keira.

$review_text.: I have liked everything I've read by J R Rain especially the Samantha Moon books.  Then out comes this book he co-wrote with another author which I was looking forward to reading.  Just the kind of book to read when you're not feeling well and need a little fun escape, I thought.  I couldn't believe it was even half by the same author.  The characters were flat and boring.  The plot was implausible and boring.  Even though it was a short book, it seemed to go on and on in a very predictable way until it finally got slightly interesting and then ended.  Everything about it was predictable and dull.  Please, J. R. Rain, I don't know what came over you, but go back to writing the enjoyable books with believable characters and imaginative plots that I've come to expect from you.

$REVIEW.: I read "Season 1" of Final Dawn as 5 separate books, so I'll review the set as well as book 1. This is very different. Nuclear war destroys almost all of humankind. Four survivors battle to get to Richmond, VA, to try to determine what is happening. The books deal with their adventures. At times, they are a bit slow and repetitive, other times unbelievably fast-paced and exciting. Book 3 really speeds up the action, and it keeps up the rest of the way, through book 5. Since this is Season 1, the author is planning 1-2 more seasons (books). The ending is satisfactory, not a cliff-hanger, but there is obviously more to come. Will I read more of it? Perhaps, but I'm not sure; the story is so different from other post-apocalyptic novels. There are NO Zombies (thank god!), but the enemy is "different" and very science-fictiony. You might figure it out; I sort of had inklings of where it was going as well as the 'surprise' near the end.

$review_text.: OK western for the price, as another reviewer said

 Bodie is a bounty hunter, the best of the best, and always gets his man/men

 There is a bit of a mystery when he is hired to track down a difficult bunch of outlaws, but the short book wasn't that engaging


 And his brief sex scenes and sexualized descriptions of women are gratuitous.A few scenes don't ring true - for example, he tries to get information from a mortally wounded bad guy who b basically tells him "hell no"

 As Bodie walks away, the bad guy says words to the effect - "you aren't going to just leave me here in pain"

 Instead of trying to bribe him with whiskey or the promise of a quick death, Bodie just shoots him straight out.Sure Bodie is talented with a gun, smart at tracking, and a strong silent Western hero type
 But the writer doesn't open him up to the reader so we can feel something for him

 I love Westerns, so it is an ok read, but disappointing.

$REVIEW.: I don't give this 5 star review lightly. Most books I read are 3 or maybe 4 stars tops, however I absolutely loved this series! It's all in blog posts which was a really different way to present a book. Even though there is plenty of zombie action, it's more of a daily struggle to survive after the world goes wrong. They seem to have more problems with the living than with the dead and you really get to know the characters throughout the book. They try to set up a nice little settlement after tons of hard work only to have it taken away and having to start over time and time again. This series has stuck with me to this day, and I have read probably a hundred books since then. To me, that's a sign of a really good book (or series) if you can't stop thinking about them!

It is a character based ghost story of sorts, which is more psychological than gory - far more interesting in my view - especially when the characters seem to emerge from the protagonist's mind rather than from reality.A good read, although a little stilted in places and worth reading for those who enjoy something different.

$REVIEW.: This is a delightful, informative and easy to read introduction to one of the most labor, space and time efficient ways we can garden. Ms. Green provides the basic information to get started and a wealth of options to inspire the reader to try new and different aspects of gardening.As horticultural therapist I recommend the used of raised beds as one of the ways to improve accessibility for gardeners with physical limitations as well as those dealing with space and time constraints. She points out both the advantages and disadvantages of raised bed gardening, and advice on how to make your gardening experience productive and enjoyable. While a raised bed isn&#8217;t the answer for every need, she provides you with information on how to handle everything from bad soil to weeds.Not only is there a wealth of information in this little book, it is a pleasant read. This is a garden book that you can, and will, read in a single setting because of the way the it&#8217;s written. I would recommend this book to both beginning and experienced gardeners.

$review_text.: NOTE: Beginner's book!, even though this is the &quot;second&quot; related book by this author.This book gives the reader a great introduction to object oriented programming in Visual Basic.  It will help you to realize  that if you've programmed the basics in Visual Basic (perhaps with John  Smiley's first book), objects really aren't that much harder than what  you've been doing.  It's just a different approach.All programming books  should concentrate on having the reader do examples.  The author makes sure  of that.  He works on taking a normal, working Visual Basic project and  redoing it as object-oriented.  The CD includes the files from the old  project and you re-program it object-oriented as you step through the  lessons.  There are chapters on Collection objects, manipulating Excel and  Word by using VB OOP, and creating ActiveX components.The book is almost  700 pages because the author uses a &quot;classroom&quot; dialog.  He was  attempting to do two things: put it in a classroom-simulated situation and  keep it an enjoyable read (unheard of with programming books) with comments  from the class.  I like the idea, but the comments get tiresome, adding  extra fluff not needed in the book.I had to get this book because of the  rave reviews and because I wanted to advance my knowledge of Visual Basic.  The book really takes off in the later chapters, just maintain the same  patience you'd have if you were sitting in a classroom and had to listen to  other people speak up.

$review_text.: Faraday, Maxwell, and the Electromagnetic Field is a readable and engaging account of the two pioneers of the subject and how they developed as individuals and developed their respective theories.  Electromagnetics and the field theory that came with it is one of the most important development in physics and allowed us to move from the theory of classical physics to what is today modern physics.  Nancy Forbes and Basil Mahon give the reader an account of the evolution of thinking on the subject by writing the overlapping biographies of Faraday and Maxwell.  It is engaging, readable and gives the reader a sense of the subject by discussing the physical results that both characters and in particular Faraday personally discovered.In reading the book one gets a sense of the character of each and where there strengths and weaknesses lied.  Faraday, born in 1791 was an incredible experimental physicist.  He had the fortune early in his career to work with Davy who was a skilled experimenter as well.  One gets a sense of the totally open nature of the subject during that era and how it was wide open to be explored.  Faradays growing stature and influence is documented and the reader is familiarized with the deep insight Faraday had about discussing the phenomenon he was observing via a field theory rather than the action at a distance models that continental europe was focused on.  The historical statements that are documented in the book give a sense of how visionary Faraday was.  Despite his remarkable qualities as an experimental scientist he was not mathematically trained and the formalizing of the theory into something along the lines of newtons theory of classical mechanics was lacking.  Maxwell, the Scottish prodigy, was to come along and bridge the gap.  The history of Maxwell and his family is given as was his academic journey.  Maxwell was a polymath and knowledgeable about a great many things without any ego.  He brough methods of vector calculus to the subject of electricity and magnetism and at first proposed models purely to try to describe results rather than to figure out the actual physical processes that were occuring.  Slowly though his more cumbersome models became more elegant simple mathematical explanations and Maxwell was the one who came up with the terms Div, Grad and Curl- methods fundamental to modern vector calculus and electricity and magnetism.  Maxwell died young and his theory became more ane more appreciated as physicists caught up with mathematics and Oliver Heavyside simplified the equations a bit.  The author briefly discuss the start of the quantum revolution as well.Faraday Maxwell and the Electromagnetic Field is fun an enjoyable to read.  I found it informative both from a historical account of two remarkable physicists and also a refreshed idea of how the theory was slowly developed from experiments that were only pieces of a much larger and complicated puzzle.  The two men were remarkable and the authors did a great job giving the reader a sense of their accomplishment and how it has impacted all of our lives.

$REVIEW.: The title of this makes sense after you read it because you'll be like "dude I want more now!"Honestly this book was awesome, I loved the last one but honestly it didn't hold a candle to this one. I loved the characters, all of them and honestly can't wait for the next(or if I'm being completely honest the rest of them) I want it now. I read this book in one go and that was during the big game against Belgium today, I was torn then between watching the game and reading and reading won out for the most part. Every time something happened I was tempted to yell out GOAL, it's a good thing I didn't because my brother would have thought I'd gone crazy. I'm not going into details on anything in the book because I don't want to spoil anything and I don't know what to say.All in all the book was great and I will be patiently waiting for the next(I'm totally lying, I hate waiting for books). I totally say pick up this book.

$review_text.: This is about what happens when Hannah chooses to move to London on a whim and how she makes the adjustments in her life like finding a job, finding a place to live and even try her hand a little bit at dating


 Some of her experiences while in London are varied
 Through Mark she lands herself a job, but he turns out to be far from boyfriend material for sure and Barry ends up being the perfect man but is he perfect for her

 And she happens to be developing a frienship with Sam but could it possibly turn into something more?In the midst of her relationship troubles she works at the party planning business that she manages to get a job at all the while working for the not easy to get along with Felicity
 At first Felicity doesn't allow her to do much but grunt work


 Will she get passed things like making her boss's tea and answering phone calls or is she destined to do it forever

 And will she ever get the invitation into the closet that Felicity guards like a hawk?  There are rumors that it's full of all kinds of wonderful fashions and fabulous shoes, that some of the employees have been allowed to wear to the events that they plan.Moving to London was an incredibly big step for her especially since it meant leaving her best friend Stacy behind back home


 A part of her wonders why her friend was so eager for her to go


 And there are moments when she has doubt and questions her decision to move to London


 But she does make some friends like Chloe, a woman who gives her great relationship advice and in exchange Hannah is able to share her fashion knowledge as Hannah is pretty obsessed with fashion and buys many of the fashion magazines pretty religiously.Many things happen to her over the course of a year in her brand new city

 And she goes from a naive tourist at the start of the book to actually being able to someone new to the city who was just like her when she first arrived


 And along the way she has even had a chance to experience many of the tourist/cultural things that the city has to offer.If you like chick lit books or want to learn a little about London from the first person point of view this was a very entertaining and fun read.

(See, I told you "Mission Impossible".) So, before you pick up the book, be sure and drop your baggage.Originally I borrowed it from a friend to read (thank you Judi), but bought a copy so I would be able to read it again.Being able to experience what living in this physical world is like through the eyes of a yogi is a once in a lifetime opportunity. He did so much and kept a low profile.  My kind of guy.And, as if that weren't enough, how many Spiritual teachers, not to mention yogis, have a surf break named after them?

She decides her brother's a dead man for telling his best friend and business partner that he could have the cabin this week

She's known buttoned-up, suit and tie wearing John McBride since they were nine years old, and he's gotten under her skin since day one.John doesn't know why everything he says or does causes Kelsie to snap at him


She interprets his glances and questions as judgments on her weight, tattoos and piercings

He's fascinated with her, in reality, and just wants her to see him as a man so he can treat her like a woman

He's determined to use the week to change things between them.The Sweetest Tattoo isn't very long at just shy of 30k words, but it packs a lot into the space

John and Kelsie have known each other for 20+ years, which helps establish their connection
Dane uses dialogue and memories to share their bits of backstory to show how they became the people they are


It's an opposites attract story on its face, but then you also realize they have a lot of common experience, making them sort of two sides of the same coin
Both faced adversity when they were young, but they both chose different ways to deal with it.It wasn't the best sex writing I've ever read, but it was certainly above average

While there was a lot of it, it was full of emotion and character development, so it never felt gratuitous
Major props for the hero volunteering to use a particular sex toy before he was to do the same to her so he'd be in the know


It was a surprisingly hot scene with a lot of feeling to it, but I was totally surprised to see that


Nice gamble, imo.I'd suggest this for anyone who likes a quick and naughty novella without any particularly kinky elements to it.

$REVIEW.: The main character has little feeling and reading about how she came to be  that way was great


The entire plot was wonderful, cleanly written with  nothing left hanging and Cleo was endearing but maddening


The author's  description of the era and township was flattering and understandable


You  will never forget Cleo.

$REVIEW.: This took place in high school, senior year. Nero is the son of THE mob family, one day hoping to get into the family business. His father is ruthless, his brothers are ruthless. They have no problem killing. Or kicking the crap out of anyone.Elle goes to a private school and is picked on relentlessly. The bullying was so severe. Getting her hair chopped off while held down, slammed in the face with a textbook, broken arm. Food thrown on her. It was so overdone that I didnt believe it. And this bullying is by boys and girls. Her friend Chloe, used to be in the bullying click, but something happened and now its Elle and Chloe against the rest of the school. Elle takes all the beatings for her AND Chloe. This part of the story was OTT. The way they walked to class, head down, the way they were in the cafeteria. Just everything.Elle witnesses something she shouldn't and Nero's dad asks him to get close to Elle to find out what she knows. It's basically to find out if they should kill her. But its a mob boss, of course he wants to kill her.Nero gets close to Elle, so fast and out of the blue, it was another thing that didn't make much sense to me. All through high school he knew she was being bullied, but claimed he didn't know the extent. Which is funny because he slept with all the mean girls that did the bullying.Elle's parents don't say anything about all the beatings, markings, and the obvious change in attitude. Teachers do nothing. It was all quite weird. And this is at some fancy private school.Nero of course falls for the girl that his father wants dead. Reading all this unfolding had my eyes rolling. I didn't for one second buy the Mob aspect of the book. Nero becomes her shield, and his boys protect Chloe. Lots of stuff goes down when Nero wants revenge. A lot of this was just unbelievable for me. I just didn't enjoy it. It was more YA for me, but that is not the reason I didn't like it.

$REVIEW.: I had the honor of being asked to write a forward to this collection. And I can't do something like that without reading it. All. Swamped with work and reviews, I just didn't have time. But I made time. And I read this bad boy in one sitting. What makes the collection so compelling is five distinct voices united around a common theme, dystopia, but while that phrase often mitigates all fun or joy, that isn't the case with Robot. The authors go to great lengths to let each story breathe and unfold on its own terms. Even the "heavier" pieces by Sayles and Kirkman display such lyrical poeticism that the reader never feels he or she is being talked to. Weighty matter told with brevity. This is a trip you take, willingly. A funny, wild, uncertain ride into tomorrow. Because let's face it: that's WHAT tomorrow is: uncertainty. And any book that has Ayn Rand getting sucker punched is my kind of book. This collection is old school pulp. Even digitally you can feel the cheap print. And that is a very, very good thing.

$REVIEW.: The Holy Land: An Armchair Pilgrimage is a gorgeous coffee table book, which highlights significant Biblical places (e.g., Gethsemane and Cana) and churches of importance (e.g., Ascension Chapel). The book is divided into the following eight geographical sections:1. Bethlehem and Ein Karem2. Jerusalem Old City3. Mount of Olives4. East of Jerusalem5. Mount Zion6. North of Jerusalem7. Western Galilee8. The Sea of GalileeWhen I first opened this book, I went through it and only looked at the pictures. I must confess that if this book included nothing but those pictures, it would be worth the price for the pictures alone. After my surface investigation of this book, I decided to get serious and take the time to actually read the accompanying text. His descriptions and attention to detail make you feel like you are on an actual pilgrimage with Fr. Pacwa. It also makes you wish for even more pictures in the book or perhaps for an accompanying DVD tour. Each chapter then ends with a prayer, which can be used for guided meditation. So far I have only had time to quietly reflect on a couple of these places. I plan to re-visit the book many times in the future though, especially when the places tie in with major feast days in the Church.My favorite place to read about was a toss-up between The Holy Sepulcher Church and the Church of the Dormition of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The Holy Sepulcher Church is venerated as the site where Jesus was both crucified and buried. Underneath the altar is an actual rock from Calvary. How awesome this place must be in which to worship. There is a yearly miracle that occurs here, which Fr. Pacwa failed to mention, and that is the Miracle of Holy Fire. I chose the Church of the Dormition of the Blessed Virgin Mary as my second favorite chapter for Fr. Pacwa's inclusion of an excerpt from "The Book of the Passing of the Most Holy Virgin, the Mother of God." This was incredibly fascinating to read, and it sheds light on questions of "Did Mary die?" or "Why was Mary assumed into Heaven?"If going to the Holy Land sounds awesome but you currently lack the funds or opportunity, then I would recommend this book instead. While it's not the same as an actual pilgrimage (Really, what is?) it will at least provide you an introduction, a sampling of what is in the Holy Land. When you finish the book, do not casually put it on your bookshelf only to forget about it. Instead, place it on your coffee table or another place where you will see it everyday. It is a book you can visit multiple times throughout the Church Year to meditate with, especially seasons like Advent or Lent, and grow closer to God.
$SUMMARY.: Makes me want to take a real pilgrimage to the Holy Land!

Example 2 : &quot;More Jedi. But they are only  women.&quot; To which Leia responds, &quot;Vardna Mojaya! You've hurt  Luke.&quot; Did he not know that? (2) The plot stinks. DEI brought back the  emperor from the dead and armed him with the usual superweapon. DEII  (surprise!) brings back the emperor from the dead and arms him with a  superweapon. Excuse me? Didn't we just see that in the last episode? Can  you spare an original idea? (3) The artwork stinks. None of the characters  look like the actors.

$REVIEW.: I admit from the start that I really chose to read this book out of curiosity
I wanted to see how these two doctors would write about such delicate subjects as puberty, marriage, and physical intimacy, among others

Being as this is written with a Christian based perspective


Growing up in a Christian home myself, I know that these subjects where not something we discussed when I grew up


But then, I&#8217;m a grandmother now! Fortunately things have changed and we now educate our children with values and principles from the Bible concerning these realities of life, before the world reaches our children, or at least that&#8217;s the desires of our hearts
One thing is certain, if we don&#8217;t teach them they will learn from the world and will be attracted by the world, and we certainly don&#8217;t want that.Dr
Chris Richards, consultant Paediatrcian and Dr
Liz Jones, a retired Community Paediatrician, have written an excellent piece of work for young girls between the ages of 9 to 14 years old


I found this book to be very complete as to what a young girl actually needs to know about issues she&#8217;ll be facing in the near future or what she&#8217;s actually living

They did an excellent job of explaining simply but precisely what the Word of God says about many of these important issues
Here as some examples they write about:Marriage,Living together before marriage,Our roles as men and women,Puberty,Menstruations,Hormones changes and how it affects our bodies, mind, and humour,And some major differences between boys and girls.More subjects are covered and in each case I found them to be accurate, precise, simple and clear
I appreciated how the Word of God was woven in so appropriately to every subject.Interestingly, I found myself thinking somewhere in this small book of 77 pages, that many young or older women I know would actually learn a few things from reading this book

Despite the fact that it&#8217;s for a much younger audience! Now that&#8217;s proof to me that this book is good in its content

This surly is a book a mother would want to read and study with her own daughter.I found nothing to be disrespectful or dishonorable despite the fact that certain issues are sensitive
I&#8217;d say quite the opposite! Many issues of great importance have been brought out into the light of the Gospel and strengthen with the grace of God to be respected and honored like God had ordained them from the beginning.I am thankful that this little book exist and I do hope that moms and dads will take advantage of this good quality of writing based on the Bible to teach their children of important matters in life
It is also illustrated to help along for those that are more visual
But once again, it&#8217;s just enough not too much
All is well dosed and brings everything into equilibrium!Ann L Beaulieu*I have received a free copy by Cross Focus Media


However I am under no obligation to write a positive review


These are entirely my own personal opinions and thoughts expressed according to my own discernment.

$REVIEW.: Wild Desert Rose, by Van Holt, is a western romance that is a whole lot of western with not so much romance to it.  It follows a young half Indian girl by the name of Rose.  Rose's home life was not that good to her and because of this she leaves home to work for a wealthy, older man.  What Rose gets is someone that only uses her for her body.  Rose kills him and flees in hopes of a better life.  Rose's adventure across Texas introduces many characters to the story.  Some of them are good, while others are evil (like in any story), but each of them bring something to the table.Van Holt does a great job at keeping the story completely unpredictable.  Though I almost never read from the western or romance genre, I found myself enjoying the story.  There were enough twists and turns to keep my interest.  Good job to the author.

On numerous times, Kathleen has faced life threatening danger to put things to right, also now is faced with present dilemma... being truly in love with Blane and her strong feelings for Kade. Her life being saved more than once by Kade, she's formed a special bond with him, a strong pull and sexual attraction between them she is torn and questions herself what she feels for him.Blane...rich, ambitious and a powerful lawyer, handsome, enigmatic... with the love and strong desire for Kathleen, who's also driven to protect and keep her safe, keeps him from telling her the truth that causes friction and doubt between them.Kade...dangerous, dynamic, broodingly handsome...desperately in love with Kathleen...loyal, protective, he loves his brother Blane he'll give his life for him but willing to cross the line and betray him if he can have Kathleen. He's always trailing her to keep her safe, he relentlessly pursued her and insinuated himself to prove there is that strong desire and undeniable attraction between them that shouldn't be ignored, that they belong to one another.Together, this three had gone through unending nerve wracking, gripping and spell binding moments through out the story it will keep you on the edge of your seat...Kathleen's one to one moments of truth with Blane and Kade is exhilarating and spellbinding not knowing who is the better man and whom she should choose... and in the end, it is the battle of the heart that will rob you out of breath!It's amazing how this author combined this action packed, riveting, anti-climatic story with sensational love story of this dynamic trio! Congratulations Ms.Snow for a job well done! Bravo! Looking forward to the next compelling and absorbing book yet to come...thanks for the thrill!

$review_text.: I never understand why Cisco does not want to publish some update editions of this invaluable book! Purchased this as a reliable and of course highly recommended supplementary resource to brush up on my switching skills for the R&S; CCIE lab back in 2007-2008. Yet, found it almost "useless". Explaining some concepts in greater details than other Cisco press books on the market, this book suffers from a big problem: almost all the examples are presented in such old fashion that renders them ineffective for the new exams where the "set based" and other dated CAT commands can no longer be thought of as valid tools. Needless to say, the same problem will be experienced by readers when they try to get them implemented in real world, if the book is used as a reference. It sounds like a big drawback to me especially when it comes to the lab preparation process. What I needed for the test was a concise well-designed structure on the main concepts e.g. STP (it did have it) and many complex and reliable configuration examples which I never managed to find in this edition.Simply put, should you happen to be a great Set-to-IOS converter, you'd probably enjoy those examples and the conversion challenge.

$REVIEW.: It focuses on the relationship between two brothers which veers into an unhealthy romance because of abuse

One brother maintains the line that they can't be romantically involved, the other wants desperately to cross it

In the end they don't (most likely because Amazon refuses to host anything in which authors have characters willingly engage in incest for titillation), but it was a lot of near misses, conflict and confusion


Anderson addresses many taboo topics, but this is one that I personally have to back away from.

Split into three primary types of tidbits, this book is a mixed bag at best.Examples of the Practical:How to pull of an eBay scam (mostly illegal), beat a speed camera (unlikely but possible), negotiate with terrorists (provided you aren't afraid of death), count cards at a casino (if you want to get your head cracked), have fun in an elevator (if you want to make everyone hate you), and stuff you shouldn't do in an elevator (old news).Examples of the Interestingly Impractical:How to stage a coup (interesting for today's political climate), become a Mafia boss (in real life, not on myspace or facebook), build an atom bomb (doubtful), perform heart surgery (only if you like death and inevitable jail time), and bullfight (for fans of puncture wounds).Examples of the Stupidly Impractical:See Chapter one and several others like it.Aside from my successful eBay scam and the money I got posing as an African Prince with financial difficulties, this book didn't really provide me with any useful "forbidden" knowledge.  I realize this is a book with its roots in humor, but I didn't laugh that much while reading it, either.  It's essentially a bigger, slightly better list that's similar toCyber Jokes: The Funniest Stuff on the Internet.

$review_text.: Dez Burke's books just keep getting better and better! I loved Burned By Passion! Blake and Kira's sex scenes were scorching hot and their love was so real, and tender, and beautiful. I enjoy reading about those push and pull love stories with a little angst... And Burned By Passion definitely delivers. What Kira needed, Blake provided with everything he had--- all his heart and soul. Beautiful story. Blake and Kira are so dynamic and three-dimensional! I also loved Blake's father Bretton and his love for and support of Kira. I'm eagerly anticipating Dez Burke's next book! I'm officially a Burkeaholic!

$review_text.: I thought it was one of the coolest ideas for a Star Wars comic ever: what if the Rebel attack on the Death Star had failed? What if the happy ending to the original Star Wars movie had never happened?I personally really like both "what if" scenario's and Star Wars, so the prospect of a comic book bringing those two together sounded like a dream come true.After having read the actual comic I must admit my initial enthusiasm has diminisched somewhat, but still...By all accounts, this comic is a real fan thing. If you are just looking for a good sci-fi comic: look a little further because anyone with no particular interest in Star Wars probably won't like it all that much.Most fans, though, will probably love this book. It has some ideas and concepts in it that could have made it the greatest Star Wars comic series since Dark Empire, and it fails to do  just that by only a small margin.But although it has all these really cool ideas (such as Leia making some unexpected careermoves and the Death Star's alternative end at the hands of a certain short, green Jedi-Master), the execution of those ideas just seems a bit lacking.The storyline, for one, could have been a lot (and I do mean a LOT) better. People turn to the Dark Side of the Force and back with something of ashonisching ease, the dialogue seems tacky at times and some events and plottwists are just plain implausable. As for the art: it all tends to look a tad on the sloppy side and seems to have been drawn in something of a hurry (artists having problems keeping their deadlines? Low priority?).All in all, this comic gave me the impression the artists had some really cool ideas but simply lacked the time to use those ideas to their full potential. A real shame, really.Still, the end result should give most of you SW zealots a pretty good read. Only it could have been a LOT better than just that...

$review_text.: Of All the Stupid Things is an exceptional look into how the smallest of rumors can have a large effect. Told through the perspectives of Tara, Whitney Blaire, and Pinkie, the reader gets to the heart of the rumor and discovers the truth of what friendships, and even love, means to each of them. At first glance, the three perspectives can seem a little much; however, I really enjoyed seeing every side of the story. It gave me a deeper look into the whole picture. If the novel had only been from the one perspective, then I do not believe that the novel could have been as powerful.Of All the Stupid Things is a novel that will make you think... not only about rumors and friendship drama, but also about what love is. In our society, it is too easy to get caught up in the labels game. Are you straight... gay? I loved that Diaz took on this challenge and showed readers that you do not necessarily have to have a label when it comes to love. The novel shows that, in the end, what really matters is the person.This is a powerful novel. I loved that Diaz focused on showing people the power of acceptance.. the power of understanding. This is a wonderful and intriguing read that will leave readers with fresh look at the world.Readers should be aware: This novel contains scenes of kissing and sexual situations, both of the same and different sex. In addition, there is some minor usage of curse words.

After having his every wish met, except for love and a happily ever after, he finds himself out on a limb and responsible for himself. Having bought the little church he has grandiose plans to make it a gay wedding venue but is truly out of his depth. His designer clothes hardly fit his new country lifestyle but he is determined to try and make his dream a success and fit in with the locals.Joe and Will are twin brothers and meet Mackenzie whilst pricing up some work for him. The twins have been responsible for their siblings since their parents died a role Joe especially takes very seriously. Joe is a man of few words. He is hard working and always concerned for how the rest of the family is coping, giving himself very little time for a personal life of his own.Two more different men you couldn&#8217;t find yet they can&#8217;t seem to stay away from each other. This is a slow, mainly happy story about love and family. There are a few dramas thrown in along the way, mostly concerning the younger brother Nick, who I didn&#8217;t like, who seemed consumed with jealousy and rage. The rest of the problems seemed to be caused lack of communication, something both men failed at over and over again!As their relationship moves forward it has to stand up against family, ex lovers and a bunch of friends who think they know best. Mackenzie has to come to the realisation that the world does not revolve around him and that sometimes love is the most important thing. Joe must realise that his family is growing up and that it is ok for him to take some happiness and time for himself.Narration ReviewThe narration was clear and concise and I found it easy to follow and understand the story.  I just didn&#8217;t gel with his voice for the characters. I though he made Joe sound slow and older than he was portrayed. I think if you read the book you would get a different impression of his character entirely.

$review_text.: After finishing this book I quickly went to the next in the series, &#8220;The Orb&#8221; and was delighted with new characters and a continuation of Tom and Elizabeth&#8217;s story. Can&#8217;t wait for the third book to come out!This story begins with Tom, a smart, attractive college student with a strong libido planning out his next move. Since Halloween is the next day he better find himself a great costume, the key to getting into a naughty nurse&#8217;s undies is to impress with a manly outfit and quick wit. He has the wit so he&#8217;s on a quest to find the costume to match.When he finds the odd shop that he swears wasn&#8217;t there yesterday his brain rationalizes that he must&#8217;ve been too drunk to notice it before. Besides, the only time he was in this side of town was when he was downing drinks at the club. So he ventures in and meets the lovely Elizabeth, and she changes his life forever.What I&#8217;ve come to really enjoy about this author&#8217;s writing is the realness factor. Our brains are so wired to accept the things we see that we can rationalize almost anything. So it is with Tom, the costume can&#8217;t really be moving, it most be the lighting. My body is changing into a woman, okay&#8230; I must be on an acid trip!I enjoyed the humor, hot hot hot sex scenes and the creativity in this book and book two. I have so many questions (mostly about Elizabeth&#8217;s past) so I am excited for the third installment to come out.Oh and out of curiosity I Googled &#8220;Symbiote&#8221; and this is what Wikipedia gave me, &#8220;The Symbiotes envelop their hosts like costumes, creating a parasitic bond through which the host's mind can be influenced.&#8221; &#8211; which is exactly what happens to Tom in this story. But here is where the author gets creative, these humans did not simply stumble across some amazing life altering creatures. Nope, it&#8217;s a lot more intricate and interesting story.

$REVIEW.: I'm really sorry to give this book 2 stars because there are a lot of good things about it.  Monty is a wonderfully protective alpha male, Georgie is a delightful bluestocking... but they're both idiots.Or, rather, say they act in ways that seem completely out of character in order to create the drama of the book.No matter how many times Monty thinks about how smart Georgie is, yet how she has little commonsense, it still never made any sense to ME why he didn't tell her about the bet at White's and why she should avoid Lord Haworth.  Especially when he discovers that she wants to meet Lord Haworth and that Haworth apparently has something that he can give her that she believes no one else can (even though she won't tell Monty what "it" is).  Considering how well Monty knows Georgie and that he should realize she's not going to let anything stop her, the ideal thing for him to do would be to TELL HER why she shouldn't.  It's not like she has to believe him, but at least it would have made the situation much more realistic if he'd blurted it out and she thought he made it up.Instead I spent the entire novella rolling my eyes because both of them are behaving in such a stupid manner that seems completely contrary to how smart they both are.  There also didn't seem to be a whole lot of focus on the romance between them.  Even after Monty kisses Georgie she barely spends any time thinking about it, she's still too obsessed with the balloon.Personally I would have liked to see a lot more focus on the romance and a lot less focus on her balloon ride.  It just frustrates me when I have to read the characters going round and round in circles that could be cleared up much more interestingly through ONE conversation.  I hate it when a plot turns on the fact that the characters just won't tell the other one what they need to know.

$REVIEW.: I received this book as part of the Friends of AK Press plan (something anyone interested in AK Press books should look into).  It is a classic 1948 book on, of course, workers' councils.  What makes it interesting is the author's  views on the history of capitalism, Nazi Germany, communism and socialism (anarchism is even touched upon).You may not agree with everything in this book (especially you capitalists), but it is worth checking out just for the alternative viewpoint.  The ideas the author puts forth in this book are not things that are touched upon in the mainstream media or business press.  In fact, those outlets fear these ideas for the very reason that it puts power back into the hands of the people.There are better books written on the downfalls of capitalism, but there are few books on workers' councils that are this good.  It doesn't dictate, and it does its best to loosely guide, which is exactly the kind of plan you need when it comes to workers' councils, as every situation could be different.Another fine book from AK Press.

$REVIEW.: The feeling of loving your pet. The feeling of your pet loving you back. Trusting you. The feeling of you trusting your pet. It's beautiful. I once had a dog named Laska. How I would have loved him to always listen to me like the unicorn Yuri did to the boy Carl. But alas, Laska was always trying to escape, too busy exploring new territory, hunting rabbits, never catching one, always catching the ball, never returning it. O, how I would have loved to saddle him up and ride, like Carl did with Yuri. But he wouldn't have let me. It would have broken his back too.But now I have this book. Kirsten Alene gives us a great unicorn with Yuri. If there's one unicorn you would like to have, it's him (well, maybe except for the gigantic Hamidol because he is just awesome). And there's a great story to go with it. The main character Carl is trying to find out what happened to his missing father. In his search he has to deal with the unicorn he thinks his father left him, for whatever reason. And then he discovers the existence of the Unicorn Riders. Carl is definitely an underdog. A little naive sometimes, but someone you want to root for. It was great to see him care for Yuri.There are some amazing ideas in this book. I would have never expected a sea battle with the Unicorn Battle Squad being pure cavalry. I thought it was great how the cavalry got loaded on a ship, completely neutralising their strength, according to normal battle theory. The Eastern Queen mentioned in the description of the book is quite a character too. The part with her involved is really bizarro, and I loved it the most.Kirsten Alene slowly drags you into the world she created. The story reads very cleanly, has a good pace and builds up to a strong finale. There is some good art in there too.Pick it up if you love unicorn pets!

The plot was pretty good which is one of the main reasons that i kept reading


I think the thing that got me the most is that this book left VERY little to the imagination

There was definitely a lot of heat but at times it felt like i was reading a hardcore porn flick instead of an actual book


The characters were ok but after a while the Holly Heart started to get on my nerves
There were some grammatical errors as well as several unnecessary sentences
Like I said, it left very little to the imagination.Overall, I did like the book because the overall plot was good and I enjoyed the fact that the author focused mostly on the main characters and plots and didnt waste time with a ton of unnecessary side stories

I liked Mason and Sterling and loved their friendship
This book at the time of purchase was free and as much as I hate to say it, I am seriously considering buying the next one in the series.

$REVIEW.: I do believe in reincarnation and hoped for more from this book and its exercises that are meant to remove your blocks in this life by healing your fears from your past lives. This is supposed to speed up the process to get us to Stage 4 Consciousness. He presents a very different picture of life 55 thousand years ago, a life where the tribes helped out each member, then man got greedy about 10,000 years ago and the "Illusion" took over and man became blocked from his higher spiritual self.  The block was/is based on fears - death, rejection, loss, intimacy, etc. Each chapter relates a few clients dealing with their blocks and resolving them through past live work. The author gives exercises, working with one's spirit guides to help you remove any blocks by connecting to your fears. Some of these, like envisioning yourself as a superhero and standing up for yourself seem very simple, others, like writing your future life story may be harder for many.What bothered me about this book (and I say this even though I agree with a lot of it) is the judgmental nature of some of the chapters, paragraphs on now living or recently living people. He also divides people into new souls and old souls, old souls being basically liberal Democrats and new souls conservative Republicans. I guess the judgmental, holier than thou nature of this rubbed me the wrong way. I kept thinking "Judge not lest you be judged" We were all at one time a new soul - the author seems to have forgotten that.

$review_text.: This is only a short novella, as it gives you the background to Autumn's life right up until she is due to start college.I found it quite an emotional read, the things she went through from a young age, the bullying she suffered, was awful and you really felt for her the whole time
It was written brilliantly and really had you emotionally invested in her life.Her mum getting ill and her parent's constant fighting didn't help her either, leaving her feeling very alone apart from her friend Brody and then meeting Evie later.I loved the way Clarissa had the 'stranger' in the background, although we know who he is she does not, writing that note to her, thus giving her the strength in herself to fight back!I loved this and can't wait to read more about Autumn and Hunter

Highly recommend this series!

I do my shopping on Friday and spend the following Sunday prepping about 10 meals for the month (a few chicken, beef and a few bean soups), pop them in the freezer, defrost as needed in the fridge the night before, stick in the crock pot in the morning and dinner is served!  I make my own rice or gluten free noodles on the side (and I even keep the Trader Joe kind frozen rice for when it&#8217;s too hectic to even do THAT!).

$REVIEW.: The Works Progress Administration was one of the glories of the New Deal. Although it employed millions of people, it is probably best known for the work it provided to artists and writers through the Federal Writers' Project and the Federal Artists' Project. One of the projects it embarked on was to document "how America eats", more specifically, to document local social gatherings at which food was served and thus describe "American" cookery and its importance to community. Despite the many writers and photographers who contributed to the project, the planned book (to be called "America Eats!" never came to fruition, but the papers were boxed up, and, though many were lost, many were preserved.Decades later, Pat Willard had the brilliant idea of going back to the towns and gatherings visited by the FWP writers to find out if those traditions and foods were still around. Her book alternates excerpts from the original manuscripts with her own descriptions of what she found, grouped by themes such as "Agricultural Fairs", "Fund-raising Dinners", "Political Gatherings" and the like. (She also includes a few recipes, as lagniappe.) Willard found that many of the events memorialized by the FWP writers no longer existed or had been transformed (some weren't even remembered!), but others were still going strong.As we travel the roads of the United States, eating dishes ranging from Brunswick Stew in North Carolina to barbecued salmon in Oregon, we learn, through the food and the reasons for the socializing, the history and culture of these places. Lucky Pat Willard, to taste so many good things. And I greatly appreciate her bringing the stories written for the FWP out of the boxes in which they'd been stores and into the light of day.If I have any quibble with the book, it is with Willard's defensiveness about American cuisine. The food can speak for itself!

The novel was a puzzle that fit together perfectly. I followed Tess through her struggle during captivity, her journey in finding herself, and I couldn't put it down. Q is a complicated man that has a purpose in life until Tess turns his world upside down with her inability to stop fighting for her freedom. The sexual chemistry between Q and Tess oozes off the page, and Pepper Winters is a master at enveloping the reader in the steamy erotic moments.

As it is I alert feeling ripped off after paying for something I could read in less than 2 hours...

$review_text.: Did you know that the human brain has been analyzed as having three compartments?  According to this analysis, the innermost brain, inherited from our reptilian ancestors, houses the most basic instincts.  The next layer, inherited from our earliest mammalian ancestors, is called the limbic system.  This section houses the emotions.  The outermost layer, developed still later, is called the neocortex.  This section houses our higher thinking skills.If you didn't know that before, do you understand it now?  If so, then you have just read pages 38 and 39 of "Battling the Inner Dummy."  So you know all the author has to say about the triune brain.Throughout the rest of the book, the author talks about everything under the sun.  One chapter is an introductory course on Abnormal Psychology.  Another chapter introduces us to the Theory of Relativity.  In three more chapters, we get an overview of psychotherapy techniques.  For reasons known only to himself, the author devises 10-point scales for various personality traits.  There is also an extended scenario in which Freud comes back as a consultant for an advertising campaign.  You might find it entertaining, you might think it's kyootsee-kyoot.Here are some important questions which Weiner gives only a cursory glance:Why are male heterosexuality and female heterosexuality so different?  Men patronize prostitutes and porno magazines, whereas women patronize drugstore novels.  A look at our primeval past can answer this question.Why are people attracted to illegal drugs?  Why are people attracted to foods which overdose on sugar, salt, and fat?  Probably because such stimuli did not make their appearance soon enough in the history of the human brain.The remaining questions Weiner does not discuss at all:Why is there so much misunderstanding between women and men?  Women exhort men to be honest about their feelings, but to no avail.  Men refuse to ask for directions when they are lost, much to women's distress.  These questions, too, can be answered in terms of the triune brain.Why does a schoolteacher see the classroom as a battleground and see the students as enemies?  Probably because the schoolteacher is clicking on the wrong section of the brain.Why is one person so often proud of another person's accomplishment?  When a citizen from your hometown wins a big competition, the whole town celebrates.  Why should anyone else be proud when it was only that one person's accomplishment?Likely because the citizens unconsciously think they are at war with everybody else.Why are we so undiplomatic in expressing our opinions to a person who disagrees with us?  After all, we want to influence the other person.  Insulting and threatening that person will certainly not do the trick!  Here again, our battle instincts come to the surface.Why does prejudice rear its ugly head so often?  Most likely because foreign language textbooks are a recent invention.  If someone who looked and acted differently from you came up to you and said "Buenos dias," you wouldn't know WHAT that meant!  The safest assumption is that it means "I'm going to eat you alive!"What poses, gestures, and physical features make children cute, make women sexy, and make men manly?  Lorenz (0674846303 and 0452011752), Tinbergen (1558210490), and Eibl-Eibesfeldt (0670167096 and 0416074804) have interesting answers to these questions, but Weiner apparently hasn't read about them.If Weiner is so interested in psychological abnormalities, he could consider the effects of living in nuclear families while our inner brains are programmed for living in extended families.  Many of our psychological problems--such as pedophilia--involve treating a person of one age or gender as we could more appropriately treat a person of another age or gender.  It is reasonable to suggest that an upbringing in the presence of people of all ages and both genders could preclude such problems.Why do liberals and conservatives fight an ongoing battle in many countries?  Some animals are interdependent because they hunt in packs.  Some animals are independent because they hunt alone.  Some animals are half and half because they hunt both ways.  That's why all dogs are Democrats, all cats are Republicans, and humans are half and half.There is much to be said about evolutionary psychology.  So why does Weiner say so little?

$review_text.: Harry's first thoughts after hearing who killed his daughter in a car crash was that of unfairness and rage. Why should someone who was drunk go scot free just because he had diplomatic immunity. This irritated Harry so much that he decided he would seek his own vengeance for his daughter Sara's death.Harry finds out the driver, Ernst Hess, a German citizen, was in the US on business and has returned to Germany. Harry travels to Munich to find him and when he does, he thinks he looks familiar. Then it dawns on Harry that he has crossed paths with Hess before many years ago during the war. When his memories come flooding back of his escaping from Dachau and being a witness to the senseless slaughter of over 500 Jews, including his own parents, Harry knows exactly who Hess is and is more determined than ever.Along with a young female journalist and a newly dishonorably discharged soldier that he met in Germany, Harry and his new friends stumble upon much more than they had bargained for in their pursual of Hess; a run in with skin- heads leads them to uncover a nest of Nazi nastiness - for some, the war has never ended, their anti-semitic mission is still ongoing. Harry vows to get some justice for not just his daughter but also for the war dead. Unfortunately, every time they make a move Hess makes a deadly counter-move, and they are not just playing games!Harry was a likeable and  admirable character but at times foolhardy in his search for retribution. As determined as he was to seek justice, he did not take into account that Hess was just as determined in his quest to hide his war crimes and present involvment in the Neo Nazi movement.I've never read Peter Leoard's books before and not knowing what to expect, I was pleasantly surprised at this action packed drama with quite a few twists that had me riveted to the plot. Although Leonard's writing is sparse and sometimes coarse, it still manages to pack a punch with excellent character development and dialogue that felt very real. Descriptions of clothing, hair styles from the 70's, mention of the Munich Olympic games and the Nuremburg trials easily brought back memories of the era.

Her man Jarvis also died on scene.The theft of the jewelry doesn't interest Trace but Marks wants him to look into the death of Jarvis. He was insured by Fidelity.So begins a really good read. This one is full of weird characters and has twists and turns all over the place.We also get Trac's parents on site.

$REVIEW.: I read a lot of mystery stories, and I have been looking for something "different."  Having been to China, I could relate to this book because you do have the eerie feeling there that not only are you different, but also that you're being constantly watched, whether out of suspicion or curiosity.  There were other aspects I could relate to, too, but I will keep this short.  For me, this book was a wonderful read.  I was engrossed in it, and when I finished, I looked to see if Ms. Brackmann had written any more, because I was ready to buy whatever she'd put out there so far.  Unfortunately, this was her first.  Also, I felt compelled to email her and tell her how much I enjoyed this book, was eagerly awaiting her next one.  It is rare for me to do this.  The last time I wrote an author to praise her work was Sue Grafton's "A for Alibi" way back in the day.

Easter has some very colorful characters in her life; Rain and Meredith Tomas. Easter comes into her own as a writer during the Harlem Renaissance.  By leaving "hate" in the South, Easter believed that people should be treated the same.  Easter is betrayed in a bad way by Meredith Tomas, her benefactor.  Easter flees Harlem and returns to her humble beginnings in the South.Bernice McFadden does an excellent job of combining fact and fiction to create this amazing story that takes us from the horrors of the South to Harlem.

$REVIEW.: The Devil's Pawn is intense, you guys
It goes from one extreme to the other


There's a lot of incredibly sexy moments mixed with gag inducing ugliness


Like I said, it's intense
I've never read anything like it.Ashton is caught up in a nightmare that is way more than she can handle

With no other choice, she's forced to become a "gentleman's escort." Make no mistake, though, these men are not gentlemen

Ashton becomes property, with no say when it comes to her own body.Derek is the mysterious house manager put in charge of the all too innocent and inexperienced, Ashton


His cruelty towards her is gut wrenching
You know there's more to it, you just don't know why or what it is yet.Derek starts to say and do things which are out of his norm and Ashton doesn't know what to make of it


All she knows is her own reaction to him, and this reaction gets better and better the more time she spends with him
Cue all the sexy.I love love love the parts with Ashton and Derek

Holy crap, it's equal parts hot and sweet.The eww factor hits EXTREMELY high during several moments
Prepare yourselves

I covered one eye through them while my skin crawled and I cringed.Despite all of the awful things that occur, I really liked this book
The characters are real and I wanted to rescue them from this nightmare

Elizabeth Finn takes an ugly subject and turns it into art

If you think you can take it, I recommend that you read it.

I think this book would be useful both for the recovering addict (myself included) as well as family members who are struggling to understand and support recovery efforts.  Dr. Twerski writes in a very clear, direct manner, and I find myself wishing the chapters were longer so I could learn even more.  He tells of several of his experiences with patients which really help to drive his point home.  If you are an addict or know of somebody struggling with addiction, I think this book can help you notice which behaviors should change.

$review_text.: From Tony Mitchell, the editor of Skin Two magazine, comes this collection of wild images that either shock viewers or turn them on big time. The general theme is artistic erotica but its forays into fetishism, bondage, and sadomasochism are its mainstay. And it's packed with wild and wicked imagery. From beautiful nudes to all-out kinky sex this book bares it all. As noted by the publisher, Edition-Skylight, "In the last couple of decades, the depiction of these subjects has become of increasingly legitimate in the world of art photography, and the effect of this has been to regale us with much better quality images as well as to remove stigma.."A wide variety of artists are gathered here in epic force including, Craig Morey, Lee Higgs, Carlos Batts, Alva Bernadine, Bob Carlos Clarke, John Dieterich, Steve Diet Goedde, China Hamilton, Kevin Hundsnurcher, Roman Kasperski, Dave Naz, Christophe Mourthe, Tony Ward, Trevor Watson, Ben Westwood, and many others.

She used to be the deputy for the Pine Apple, Alabama Police Force. Her father is the Sheriff. She is interviewing for a job in Biloxi, Mississippi. She has been interviewing for this job for six weeks, been to sixteen interviews, and now she is at the final interview with the CEO, Richard Sanders. Davis still has no idea what the job is. She takes the job and finds out that she will be doing undercover work for the Bellissimo Casino and Hotel.Ms. Archer has written a fun, kind of slapstick type of female detective mystery. Davis gets in one tight spot after another as she tries to find out what is wrong with the Double Whammy Deuces Wild slot machines. They seem to be fixed. Her ex-ex-husband, Eddie Crawford, is right in the middle of the fix. Before too long the dead bodies start to show up and all the clues point right toward Davis. She ends up in solitary, the police don't believe that her name is Davis Way, so she is listed as Jane Doe, and no one knows that she is even in jail, or where she is.All of this makes for a very fun, humorous, and entertaining read. I enjoyed this new novel by a new author. I think that this series has promise and look forward to reading the next book by Ms. Archer. I give this book 4 Stars out of 5 and a Thumbs Up. I recommend this fine first novel to anyone who likes reading books with strong female leads, humorous situations, and romantic interludes.I received this book for free from NetGalley.com.

$review_text.: As a developing author myself, I understand the nifty aspect of multiple Points of View. Unfolding the story via many perspectives should allow for a richer experience of the unfolding story. It certainly eases the process for the writer.As a reader, however, hopping around from one head to another is irritating.Fisher has the potential for a good story here, but I'm afraid I got snagged by not knowing who to care about. As well, perhaps the &#34;heat&#34; developed a bit too predictably for me.

$review_text.: Millie's Rose plunged me on an emotional roller coaster from the first page and gripped at my heartstrings and never let go. In fact, the beginning was so sad that I almost stopped reading but I'm so glad that I was too caught up in the story to halt before I reached the (happy) end. The characters in the story seemed like real people and the imagery was really vivid and helped to immerse me into the story. I did feel that Millie was too perfect but I realize that this was how everyone remembered Millie, not necessarily how she truly was. The dialogue was very authentic and I especially liked it when the adults had to deliberately make their language child-friendly. That brought back happy memories of when my two daughters were little girls. This is  not light reading but if you are looking for a beautiful love story with real heart and soul, you should certainly give this story a try.

$review_text.: Confession.  In the last few weeks I have read 4 of this authors books and will probably devour the rest shortly.  Never heard of the author before that.  I say this because, before reading this book, I had just read everything available in the Legend of Zero series and was a little bit concerned about how this different style series would be. (At least I hope it will be a series).  So I looked at the other reviews (at this point 3 reviews that have 3 stars) and read the free sample.  Was still a little leery, but decided that Zero was so great I owed it to myself to try it.  OK.  two of the three  (3 star ratings) have interesting points, the third about the editing, I will let others address because if the story is great I don't notice spelling errors and I was never big on punctuation to start.  I really wish I could talk with those guys.I guess I am a fan now.  So to one reviewers point, I don't quite understand how 5 stars just because it's from a fan should be ignored.  Its not like this lady is married to my third cousins, sisters boss's cousin in law.  Again, never heard of her before March 2013.  Don't we become fans when we find a great author?  I hope people write reviews to share something really good when they find it and to warn others when they get junk.  However, I too have seen 5 star reviews for work that I consider to be atrocious so not sure what to take from stars.Anyhow, the complaints about lack of detail & lack of an ending depend upon a point of view.  This is a huge universe that has opened up and leaves plenty of room to explain Utopia, and the aliens represent multiple cultures not to mention prequels and sequels.  The art of writing is beyond me but what determines whether an author writes a short story, book or a series seems kind of in the artsy world to an electrical engineer/computer geek.  I just make computers follow instructions.Lack of Emotion is an interesting point as I found myself laughing out loud and wanting to kick Athenais butt.  This is a lot lighter and more tongue in cheek than Zero but I liked it.  Don't want to be a spoiler so I will just say that there is one point where having three people becomes important and if that doesn't leave you LOL then I must be super geek.  That's why they make chocolate and vanilla I guess, some like it hot and some like it cold.  Enough about what others think.Again its all about characters and story telling.  This, hopefully a series, could go anywhere and I will be happy for the next installment of fun and p.o.'d that I have to wait for it.  As with Zero, she paints her characters lovingly although I sense she had a lot more fun with these ones.  Sara and her partners at Parasite Publishing are re) defining a new style of story telling and I like it. Someone in another review mentioned Firefly and I could definitely say a good dash of that but not a copy in any way.Final word, buy the book - you will like it!

$REVIEW.: Written in true Rue fashion. Raw fresh and real. I love that she steps out of the box and writes. She doesn't try to make the characters inhuman. It real life. If the girl is hurting and wants to crumble to the ground and cry her eyes out she does, then gathers her strength and pushes forward. That is what Halo does in this book, she lets her emotion show without shoving them down or to the side. Wanting to  love so much she willing to put up with anything..  She lives them, deals with them while being herself and not giving up on what her heart wants.Even an abuse boyfriend. Even after finding it in her to fight back, she still has enough love in her to feel guilt and regret. Even in hell her heart is still full of love she freely gives, even though giving that love has always hurt, and cost her her life. She doesn't care, she has her heart set of Gunner, Lucifer had his uummhum set on her.... Gunner ....well....he is the Gunner he has been for centuries. A damned Hellhound... After a night together Gunner will have nothing to do with Halo, Lucifer won't leave her alone, and that grates Gunner... Lucifers has a family member get involved and the.....sorry your going to have to read to see what happens...

$REVIEW.: The ancient philosophies and traditions of Asia have proven to be a rejuvenating force in Western thought in recent years, certainly adding new levels of richness and depth to a wide array of fiction genres.  Now, with Arthur Rosenfeld's scintillating new thriller, The Cutting Season, we have what the YMAA Publication Center bills as a groundbreaking example of a new genre they dub Martial Arts Fiction.  Certainly, it's an idea whose time has come.  Don't go thinking this is some sort of novelization of a Bruce Lee movie, however, as The Cutting Season wears many literary hats in the most distinguished of manners.  Yes, there is some swordplay and violence in these pages, but what distinguishes this particular novel is the author's focus on the philosophy and spiritual awareness that form the heart of martial arts.  Those of us in the West tend to think of martial artists as skilled yet brute fighters who exist only to fight, but true martial arts is nothing less than a way of life, the embodiment of spiritual, mental, and physical strengths working together in the most balanced of fashions.The novel's protagonist is Dr. Xenon Pearl, a brilliant neurosurgeon with something of a secret life of his own on the side.  Secretly trained by his Chinese nanny, Zee has spent years honing the techniques and philosophies of a range of martial arts traditions.  There is no dichotomy to be found here, though, as Zee himself insists that the two sides of his nature are perfectly complementary.  For example, his skill with the sword or blade contributes to his painstaking skill as a surgeon, with his deep understanding of human life forces aiding him immeasurably during delicate operations.  The death of a young Russian boy on his operating table sets in motion a true spiritual awakening for the good doctor, as his nanny/martial arts teacher begins appearing to him, exhorting him to become the warrior he has been so many times over the course of his many lives - the kind of man who inflicts justice on the bad guys of the world.  Not surprisingly, Zee initially balks at the idea, having no memories of past lives and questioning his own sanity after receiving visits from the ghost of his dead nanny.As the story evolves, however, Zee slowly begins to embrace the idea of exacting justice on those who remain safe from the hands of society's justice, men such as Vlexei Petrossov, a Russian Mafia thug who apparently beat one of his children to death and has apparently been mistreating another.  It's never a good idea to get on the bad side of the Russian Mafia, but Zee's cause compels him to do just that as he seeks justice for Petrossov's dead son.  His career as a surgeon, his very life, and the lives of those he cares about are very important to Zee, but so is the vigilante mission he gradually finds himself pursuing.  Although he doesn't realize it at first, this new purpose in his life is even more important and personally significant than he would ever have imagined.Rosenfeld gives us quite an intimate picture of this man, and not just in terms of the way his scalpel and sword complement one another.  We watch his relationship to his probable soul mate blossom and grow, observe with bated breath his proficiency as a surgeon working to save lives and livelihoods in the O.R., see him take the son of one of his patients under his own wing after the death of the boy's father, and accompany him as he forges his own acceptable path to the vigilante justice he reluctantly embraces.  Every element of the story is tied to one another, even as the scope of thousands of years of personal history seemingly interlocks with the travails and rare joys of the present.Personally, I don't consider the book unduly gory or violent, although some (who obviously don't tread many of the dark paths I do) apparently do find it to be a bit much.  In the same vein, I never found myself in any sort of ethical quandary when it came to interpreting Zee's vigilante actions, as he would not have needed to act at all had modern society not increasingly shirked its obligation to seek out and punish many of the evildoers among us.Part medical thriller and part suspense thriller, incorporating a significant amount of martial arts theory and practice alongside more than its fair share of philosophical consideration of the human experience, The Cutting Season earns itself a place in the literary sun.  Satisfying the reader on many important levels, Arthur Rosenfeld has given readers one heck of a good novel.

This third book of the series tells the story from Caleb/James' point of view.It is interesting that the first two books are mostly told from Livvie's perspective during the times when she felt least in control and most vulnerable; and the third book does the same thing except that it is told from Caleb/James's point of view during the time in his adult life when he felt the least in control and most vulnerable.Well done CJ Roberts, well done indeed!

$REVIEW.: My moms group at our parish decided to get these books and do the strengthfinders quiz, mostly out of curiosity to understand ourselves and each other better.  So I've taken the quiz and was given my top five strengths, and read the book.  To be brutially honest (which, by the way, is one of my top five strengths!), much like an astrology report, it seems most anyone could randomly flip open the book to one of the 34 strengths and say "yeah, that sounds a bit like me."  Conversly, at least one of my five is not very much like me, and actually directly contradicts one of my others.  The idea beind the "top five" really pigeonholes otherwise well-rounded people; and, by the way, the book says being well-rounded is equal to being down-right dull.I also feel this book and test offers little insight to oneself as to what your strengths are.  If you are aquainted with yourself at all, you already know that you may or may not enjoy, say, public speaking.  You don't need this test to confirm what you already know.  Most of what you learn is not going to be a suprise.  It may be easier for a large organization like Gallup to screen applicants with this test rather than sit down and ask each applicant his/her talents, it is also unfair in that I think most people will have many more than five talents, and may not even use their "top five" very much.

By looking at the example code, I thought "Wow~ great UI widgets! Code seems pretty easy too".  But, I was not able to understand what ExtJS core library is... Even from the Sencha forum, they suggested that the best way to learn is read the example code... it felt a bit like homeless person kicked out during cold winter.  In any case, this book really went in depth of what is ExtJS and how I should program.  The "only" negative that I can think of is that ExtJS 4 is just around the corner to be released.. I believe that's sometime in Feb, 2011.  Of course, this is the not the fault of the author! Probably just bad timing.  Still, I'm pretty sure Jay will come up w/ new version to cover the ExtJS 4 ^_^.  Definitely, going to buy it again~

I like the way her men have issues that they work through, the ladies are quirky and have personality...although, for a series addition, this one did not advance the series plots very much -- some foreshadowing of what may be to come, but I wanted her to get on with it already.  For a shifter love story, it was just OK. With more series advancement, this one could have been much better.  I am on the fence in continuing with the series in Chloe's story...

$REVIEW.: "If You Want to Get Big Eat Like a Pig" is an anti-diet book to inform the reader ABOUT dieting, namely, the conscious restriction of food in a planned manner, the dieting mentality which is the preoccupation with what your next meal will consist of - counting calories, shunning carbs, opting for protein..., and its psychological consequences.That being outlined, the author then offers the right way to lose or gain weight by understanding YOUR body's needs.And the section on needs is encyclopedic. Challenging parroted concepts, the reader is offered pertinent information on the mind-body connection, systemic cleansing, intake of fiber, vitamins, minerals, .... right down to what deficiencies can occur, timed release supplements, choosing fats or carbs, the body as a chemical engine rather than a heat engine...and much, much more.Author Leland Benton carves out the profiles of the Somatic types - Endomorph, Mesomorph, Ectomorph - and their optimal eating patterns.He offers studies, references, and links to sites that support his statements. Easy to read, personable, the tremendous amount of very well researched information makes sense. Well worth the investment in time and money. Considering going on a "diet?" Read this first. Highly recommended.

Read it carefully; the author presents his &#34;case&#34; clearly and logically. I would not only buy this again for myself, I am seriously considering buying one or two copies for gifts.By the way, I first requested this book at my local  library. After reading only 51 pages of it, I knew I HAD to have my own copy to underline, mark up and write comments in. I very seldom find a book these days that I consider worth purchasing in order to do those things!

$review_text.: Once again not at all the direction I thought the author would have gone with the series. I was actually looking forward to more Anne and Jonah (from book 3 of the series). Those two are definitely my favorite of the series. His Passion, Her Temptation continues to be an erotic, fun and mysterious addition to the series that any fan of the genre will enjoy.Ben and Monica meet at a mutual friend's party and hit it off right from the bat. They get to know one another and find out that their families have a sort of...history. I history that is forever scarred into the minds of Monica and her family. But can history just be left at that? In the past and forgotten so that all may live in the present and actually enjoy life and all if has to offer?Even though this is a part of a series it can be read as a stand-alone. But there are a few things it might ruin for the reader if they decide to go back and read the others in the series (just some FYI) :)3.5 rounded to 4 rating.

$review_text.: It's 2053 in Dallas, Texas. Mina is a bounty hunter, who is just one step away from a major milestone in her field. If she can just make it to 25 captures, she can take her profession global. But she underestimates one of her marks, and she quickly goes from the hunter to the hunted as he tries to get even.Mina is pretty good at her job, but her personal life is a mess. She's holding on to a torch for an ex-boyfriend who abandoned her. But as the book progresses, she finally starts to question whether it's time to let go and move on... perhaps even find new love with her sexy friend Justin (who also happens to be a successful and famous musician.)The action of the story is pretty good. It's fast paced and the danger Mina faces is palpable. The future-world building that the author creates is well-crafted and easy to understand, though in the beginning the "oldies" references to the 21st century were a little heavy-handed. Mina is a strong, yet believably flawed, first-person heroine. She is likable and easy to root for.My only real complaint about the book was an ending that felt abrupt. I felt like the story was unfinished. That I was robbed of seeing a love connection for Mina play out --or a better resolution for her stinker of an ex-boyfriend. (Perhaps he could get that penis cancer she wished on him at one point... or at a bare minimum, give an accounting for his behavior.) The external conflict was firmly resolved, but with Mina's personal stuff... it just seemed like the book just stopped more than really ended. I did like the writing, the action, and the humor, though, and would read from this author again. Almost 4 stars.

$REVIEW.: Dave Roberson has done a great service to the Body of Christ in publishing his study on praying in the Spirit.  If there was a required reading list for believers, this would be on the list.  Praying in the Spirit is the gateway for His magnificent work in our lives.  Jude wrote in his epistle that believers must not be divided; rather, we must walk in the Spirit, building up ourselves (and one another) in our most holy faith, praying (at all times) in the Holy Spirit.  The fullness of the Holy Spirit leads us to pray in the Spirit; praying in the Spirit leads us to Love.  Dave's work on the gift of heavenly languages (tongues) is the best I've read to date.  Digital versions of "The Walk of the Spirit - The Walk of Power" are available in multiple languages from his website.  Be blessed and pick up a copy today.

$REVIEW.: I don't know where to start....I loved this book, and I cant believe I haven't read it sooner. It's been on my kindle for a while, and a friend encouraged me to read it - I'm so glad she did!It's a beautiful story of first love, heartbreak and betrayal. The kind of story that has heart-warming moments, funny moments and gut wrenching rip your heart out moments. You will need tissues for this book!Its the story of a blossoming relationship between Sparrow and Ian. The story actually starts with Sparrow spotting Ian in an airport and desperately trying to avoid being seen by him, but failing. They then end up being sat together on an airplane, where we discover that they have a history that goes back 5 years, and has ultimately left Sparrow devastated.We then go back to the very beginning, where they first met. Sparrow is out with her family and Ian is with friends of her parents. There is an instant attraction between them, with friendly banter going back and forth.During the course of the book, Sparrow and Ian meet up through family get togethers, but with Ian blowing hot and cold, Sparrow is often left wondering where she stands with him.The author sets the tone of the relationship perfectly, although they have that instant attraction, they do not declare their love instantly. The relationship builds over the course of a year or so, with Sparrow away at college in NYC and Ian often on tour with his band. Ian is more 'worldly' than Sparrow, (who is 19 and the inexperienced daughter of a preacher) and he wants her to experience college life without feeling tied to him.All through the book, (because of the prologue)I knew that something BIG was coming, something that was going to blow this relationship out of the water, but I still wasn't prepared for when it eventually did happen. It was absolutely gut wrenching. I truly felt for Sparrow.My heart was pounding as though I was Sparrow feeling those emotions, I felt physically sick. I wanted to crawl right in to that book and slap Ian.Ian's actions after the revelation, the way he persevered desperately trying to put things right with Sparrow had me in tears, I was utterly devastated for the pair of them.When the book gets up to the part where they are together on the plane, I could not read fast enough, because I just had to know how this story ends - will she forgive him and put them both out of their misery, or will she eventually get the closure she needs and move on with her life.......?You need to read this book and find out for yourself!

$REVIEW.: Much like the Secret McQueen series, this first book in the Misfits & Mayhem series vibrates with supernatural action

Vampire hunter, Shane, collides with the attractive, pure Siobhan while she's doing unattractive, dirty things

Together, the dynamic duo battle fae monsters through the streets of New York


Unfortunately, thanks to the whiplash length of the novella, the H/h lack much needed depth


Their slapstick interactions are more brotherly/sisterly than romantic (bar the one sex scene) and Shane doesn't have a motivation or a mission
We know he wants to save all the unsuspecting virgins, but that certainly can't be "who" Shane is

Compared to Secret McQueen, it doesn't measure up, but the high-speed action and ballsy heroine makes it worthwhile.

$review_text.: Though Franken and Moore have pretty much captured the spotlight with their books on the sad state of this country, Vidal's Dreaming War (and his Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace), is equally as important, if not more so, as it provides a solid background for understanding how we got to be in the situation we're in.  This book is a damning indictment of US foreign policy over the last sixty years or so, and how it may ultimately undermine this country if nothing is done to reverse the trend.  This is the dark underbelly of US relations with the rest of the world, one that every America needs to know.  Like his other book of essays, Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace, I cannot recommend this highly enough.

$REVIEW.: This is the first book in the Rocker series, and it was what hooked me into all the subsequent books. This book is short, sweet, and to the point, but by the end you will have to read the others to spend more time with these fantastic characters.This book tells the story of Emmie, and her guys, aka the men of the rock band Demon Wings. Reading the about Emmie's past is very raw and pretty gritty, but it really helps show how she became the woman she is today. Seeing Emmie's relationships with each of the guys was fantastic to read, and the author did a great job of creating unique features in each. At the bottom line this is a love story, and it so delivers on being a read that will make you swoon. (And make you wish you had a rocker like any of these guys.) Overall this was a great book that sets up the series well!!

$review_text.: This book is definitely a great introduction, for the layman, to the intricacies of our unconscious thinking patterns.  I understand that many are put off by the "shallowness" of the treatment of the complicated subject, yet I still think that, if you'd like to start somewhere, this is a great place to do it.David McRaney highlights psychological findings that really bring it home that, perhaps due to the fact that our minds evolved in a complicated environment and were geared towards survival more than brilliance, people live in bodies that do most of their thinking for them. And, since it's automatic, it's not always accurate.So, if you've read books on this same topic before, you'll probably get the impression you get when you watch a comedian do the same routine for the third time.  That doesn't diminish the importance of the information in the book, however, so if you finish this book and hunger for more I highly recommend Strangers to Ourselves by Timothy Wilson, and then Thinking: Fast and Slow.  But by the time you get to Thinking: Fast and Slow you will probably get the gist: You are Not So Smart.

$review_text.: I read a lot of thrillers, most of them so-so at best. I so enjoyed this one.  There is romance but the fast action and solving the main plot point is the greater focus.  While despicable, the rationale behind the villains' actions is quite believable which isn't always true of a thriller.  I appreciated, too, that the novel retained British idioms and vocabulary instead of being "translated" for American readers. If you like thrillers with some romance, I don't think you can go wrong with this choice, and at a bargain price yet.

$REVIEW.: My thoughts:Incorporeal is my first ghost romance and I am thrilled to have had the opportunity to read it
 Wonderful story!  Sweet, romantic, a bit on the spicy side - it has a little bit of everything; mystery, suspense, history, demons, guardians, ghosts, friendship, fear, loss, love...I loved that it questions the value of time ~ what would be important to you if you knew you had a timeframe?The characters are amazing!  The main and supporting characters all drew a strong reaction

 Sara and Nathan of course are my favorites, but some of the supporting characters left lasting impressions.The editor - Leah - horrible woman.The best friends - Geri and Dalton - created in the image we all hold of the women we want to spend our time with.The author has given Nathan the ability to learn to use various powers and was a pleasure to watch how that unfold

 The relationship between Sara and Nathan was both playful and serious, but also at times, so much more than what most people are given.The story was well written and entertaining
 I enjoyed the twists and turns in the last few chapters


 The end was not exactly what I was expecting, but so nicely done

 I closed the book with a sigh, loving the finish but wishing there was more.

There's even a Lucy in it, but she's on the wrong side.No, the plot is not even vaguely similar to any of the Chronicles of Narnia, but the religious fantasy aspect of the book has a lot of overlap (and also the mysterious way they travel between worlds).  But really, my main problem with the book is that it moves very slowly.  That, and the fact that the plot doesn't really hold together - but hey, it's fantasy, so no problem, right?It's not terrible, but I don't recommend it and won't continue on to the second book.

I haven't found the recipes to be too complex - they generally have 5-6 steps, and the first one is usually to preheat the oven, the last one is to serve hot or whatever.  So I've found it pretty straight forward. The ingredients are a great mix - not your basic salt &amp; pepper but adding things like honey or spices like cumin or cilantro.  Really really tasty stuff here.  Highly recommeded and I'd definitely buy it again!

$REVIEW.: I LIKE the sidebars and pictures

 There is a ton of ART history and beautiful graphic design work in the books


 Perhaps it is because my husband, son and I are all artists, but we particularly enjoyed the layout of the books

 I felt a fusion of science with art in the presentation.The history is sound, well presented, and detailed enough in scope to touch on mathmatical concepts supporting the science.I'd reccomend this book for lovers of science history and for older homeschoolers

 It is a bit too serious for younger homeschoolers


 To me, this is more a book for a older preteen or teen audience.

$REVIEW.: Original Rating: 4.5Disclaimer: I received this book from the author for free in exchange for an honest review. This does not influence my review in any way.This review was originally intended to be posted on Monday. Due to internet problems (it does get pretty annoying, lol), the review has been postponed till today. Many apologies if you were expecting to somehow appear on Goodreads or on here on Monday.Anyhoo, this was a quick read, which I managed to finish Sunday night. I find it very enjoyable, and much different from other stories (distinctly speaking). The cover is magnifo (it means gorgeous). ^_^Imagine that every female between the ages 14 through 25 go through testing due to an alliance with a race known as the Eslites and if you passed? Well... it isn't exactly something a 14 year old would want to go through (I wouldn't want to either... lol) or any teen in the matter of speaking (talk about force O_o).Miranda, as the main character/heroine of the story is described as stubborn, hard-headed and a rebel. She doesn't show much of being a rebel here, but I do think there are hints of her rebellious nature here and there throughout the story.We also have Dimas, our menacing leader of a villain. Out of curiosity, is it just me or is there almost always at least one character, good or bad, that we just find... bleh? Anyhoo, Dimas is a very creepy figure (my opinion there... he might not be creepy to others) who's desperate to save his race (and who can blame him? I just wish he wasn't disturbing... kinda).Overall, I find it a great read with uniquely distinct differences from the usual story. I do hope there's more to it though. It seems to have the potential of being a great series. :)

$review_text.: WOW! This is a HOT one! I think this by far is the hottest book Brooke has out there.Carissa Wright has grew up with a rotten childhood. Her parents didn&#8217;t give her what she needed, but instead they helped create the walls she put up. They neglected her, treated her like crap, left her to fend for herself and disappointed her time and time again.  She doesn&#8217;t know how to feel or hold any kind of emotions. She doesn&#8217;t really know how to love. The only love that she has ever known was the love of her best friend Velaney.Velaney and Carissa have been best friends for as long as they can remember. She has been the only person Carissa could ever count on. When they were old enough to, they left their childhood home to start a new life, free from all the horrible memories of the past.I absolutely love Carissa&#8217;s spitfire attitude. What you see is what you get and she will definitely tell you how she truly feels. She&#8217;s a beautiful woman that absolutely knows it and uses it to tease men around her. She knows exactly what she wants. The past with her family has her walls put firmly put up. She trusts no man out there. She feels empty and alone. With one experience in the past, it made her feel something, feel wanted by someone. She wanted that feeling again and not want the complications of a relationship. That started her love for sex.Since that experience she has been obsessed with the feeling of being wanted again. The feeling of being needed by someone. Sex gave that to her. She craved sex. There wasn&#8217;t anywhere she went where she didn&#8217;t have sex with a man. She had no boundaries. It was about feeling good and having a good time. As long as it didn&#8217;t get too intimate and feelings we&#8217;re attached, it was all fun and games. It just shocked me how many partners she had. She would have a different guy every day, sometimes two in one day. And the men that she would have sex with pretty much would approach her for that one reason. She didn&#8217;t want a relationship. She just wanted a hook up and nothing more. If they were lucky they would get a second round and nothing more.Drew ended up being a flame who spent the night, but yet she felt comfortable with him there. There&#8217;s just something about Carissa that he&#8217;s drawn to and he can&#8217;t help but want more than just one night with her. Of course after a fun night, she can&#8217;t help but crave yet another, but can&#8217;t give him more than that. Her walls are so put in place, they won&#8217;t fall. He is so persistent on wanting to try something more with her, he&#8217;s not willing to give up.There&#8217;s something about Drew that Carissa can&#8217;t forget about. She tries to get him out of her thoughts, but memories of their time together keeps surfacing and a smile seems to appear on her face. She can&#8217;t help but want more of him; something that has never happened before. Drew is the first guy she has ever want to feel this way about; she doesn&#8217;t know what to do with these feelings. It&#8217;s not even just about the sex with him. He makes her feel things she&#8217;s never felt before. He makes her happy and she just enjoys his company. He wants to truly get to know her and how to overcome her past insecurities. The sex scenes were super-hot and some parts were pretty damn kinky. Drew knows how to challenge Carissa and he wants to slowly put all her walls down. He knows she cares about him, but there&#8217;s something holding her back.Drew is in the States on a football scholarship and will be moving back to London in a few months after he graduates. Because of this Carissa has her guard put more up than ever. She doesn&#8217;t want to get too attached to Drew because she knows that if she falls for him, she knows her heart will shatter.Will Carissa be able to completely give herself up to Drew and allow herself to fall for him? Or will she ruin what she has with him because she is afraid of heartbreak? Will Drew continue to fight for her? Or will he have a breaking point and give up on her? Will Drew be able to drop a few of Carissa&#8217;s walls? Will Carissa&#8217;s past continue to haunt her relationships? Will Carissa end what they have before it gets any further? Will Drew be able to be strong for the both of them and get them through anything?Brooke does a fantastic job capturing all of Carissa&#8217;s different emotions in this book and making you see what she&#8217;s going through. I can&#8217;t help but feel bad for Carissa throughout this entire book. The past that she has had to deal with was horrible and it broke my heart. But the way she grew up feeling unwanted and unloved and turning to sex to fulfill that feeling just made me feel sorry for her. But that&#8217;s how she dealt with her emotions, I get it. I&#8217;m glad she finally met Drew. I fell in love with Drew. It made me really happy that he never gave up on her and still continued to pursue her even when she kept pushing her away. There were so many times where I just wanted to yell at her and tell her to stop pushing him away and just accept that fact that he wasn&#8217;t using her like the other guys. In a way when her past came around and bit her in the ass, I couldn&#8217;t help but laugh because that&#8217;s exactly what happens when you whore around. Great job with this book Brooke, I can&#8217;t wait for more!I received an ARC for my honest review.This review was done by Jennelyn

So far this has been the best installment of the &#34;novel.&#34;  Now that I have read the first 4 installments the characters are starting to come together.  The story of Lori and the Bishop Brothers might be better and make more sense if all parts of the &#34;book&#34; were released as one novel rather than &#34;teasers&#34; or &#34;short stories.&#34; I'm going to read the next installment because I am curious to see if the story develops and maybe I'm jumping the gun thinking it is strictly chapters based on sexual tension.

I hated the way they treated each other. It was horrible. But the worst was the way Holly treated Coop. And the way she let Jackson treat Coop. I felt horrible for him. It was COOP's child and they were completely unfair to him. The ending was pretty bad. Totally unrealistic, dumb, and reckless. And once again, so, so unfair and downright mean to Coop.

$REVIEW.: Henry Hudson was was hired by the Dutch Trading Company in 1609 to find a northeastern passage around Russia to more easily access China. Hudson started his voyage aboard the Half Moon with a mixture of English and Dutch crewmen. Part way into his voyage, he decided to turn his ship around and go west to America where he would discover the Hudson River and other uncharted territories. Hudson found himself with his hands full, wondering if there was mutiny brewing and also wondering how he would be received by the Dutch when he finally decided to back. When he did go back, he found himself on another mission to find a northwestern passage to China. That was his last voyage.When I closed the book after reading the last paragraph, I had to just sit in thought for a bit. Douglas Hunter, who is a sailor himself, wove such an intricate story of Henry Hudson. The amount of research that went into this book is amazing, and to present it like Hunter did was even more amazing to me. From the start I was drawn in, and felt like I was reading a puzzle with pieces being put together from all different sources, a little at a time, until the picture became clear. Who was Hudson? Where did he come from? Why would he blatantly disregard his orders and sail the opposite way?Since there was no journal of Hudson's to go by, many of the notes about the voyage were taken from Robert Juet's journal. Reading some of the thoughts and feelings of an actual crew member was a real treat and very insightful. I had no idea what exploration was like in the 1500 and 1600's besides the basic textbook "stuff" I received in school. I had no idea of the amount of espionage, threats of mutiny, and pirating that went on. Most of all, I had no idea how much history was re-written for gain, both financially and politically. Hudson ended being a totally different man than the explorer that was captain of the Half Moon.This book was a fascinating read, and now that I'm done, my family will be able to go back to normal dinner banter, instead of listening to me rattle on about what I found was amazing in the book. Both of my teens are now wanting to read Half Moon and I know they'll enjoy it as much as I did!

$REVIEW.: I got a little bored with the stories.  While the story lines could have been interesting, it seems the authors thought they had to put sexual encounters, on too many pages. Therefore, I wound up skipping through them a lot. I'm not a big fan of an author who has to rely on sex instead of putting a little more effort into the story.  Love doesn't mean you are jumping into bed as soon as you meet someone.

The advice on discipline was great and broke down into the many disciplines it requires to be successful, not just the discipline of money
My favorite part of the book though has to be the chapter on role models

I was not familiar with her ideas at all before this.I think this Book on Tape has alot of great ideas for people who are looking to better their lives. Alot of it specifically addresses how your mental/spiritual state effects your physical health - and how changing the way you think and feel can make you a healthier person.She talks about forgiveness, carrying emotional weight and more things than can negatively impact your physical health.I found this book on tape very helpful. She gives some really great insights. And I will definatley be reading more of her books.

$REVIEW.: The last lines of the publisher's blurb define this story as "a love so transcending, that even if the mind can't remember, it's impossible for the heart to forget" and this is exactly how I feel about this book.  It's Ah-mazing with a capital A.  Kahlen Aymes wrote  an unforgettable novel, that I can't stop thinking about, truly.This is the passionate and touching love story between Ryan and Julia, told sometimes from Ryan's point of view and at  other times from Julia's, two best friends who unbeknownst to each other, had been nourishing strong feelings towards one another. They decide to surrender to love and start a relationship which brings them close both physically and emotionally in a way they'd never been before.  I loved how they both took the leap, despite all the fears and insecurities they had of losing their special friendship. We never know if we don't try- Ryan and Julia decided to try and it was worth it...Ryan is...well...Dear authors, you have to stop writing such wonderful male characters, because, seriously, I can't get them out of my mind afterwards *giggles* I'm kidding of course, don't stop, please  ; )Ryan is that kind of character you keep thinking about way after you closed the book. He's very handsome, the object of desire of a lot of girls, extremely intelligent and he only has eyes for Julia. He loves her in a way that melts your heart and wants to keep her close at all costs. Julia is a beautiful girl and a very kind soul who loves Ryan in return with the same passion as he does her. She's ready to do everything that's in her power to make their relationship work, even if that means making a few sacrifices. And isn't that what true love means?The chemistry between Ryan and Julia is palpable and leaps off the page to the point that you can really feel it. There are a lot of passionate and detailed sex scenes between the two, written in a way that never lapses into vulgar, and they perfectly convey the overflowing and undeniable love the characters feel for each other. They reach not only a physical but also an emotional intimacy that's not always a given in romance novels.Their journey isn't without obstacles, though, and they both have to face up to the difficulties of a long distance relationship and that's when their love is truly put to test. I loved seeing them trying their best not to lose each other and making compromises in order to keep hold of  the special nature of their relationship.The secondary characters are well crafted and I have a fondness for Aaron, Ryan's best friend and adopted brother, and Ellie, Julia's best friend. They add to the story plenty of light-hearted moments especially when they tease the loving couple, making those scenes really fun to read.The story ends with a cliffhanger. I know that some don't particularly enjoy those kinds of endings, but trust me, this one will make you want to read the sequel as soon as it's out ( and, per Kahlen, it's coming out VERY soon ;- ) ). At the end of the book  we also get a sneak peek into Book 2, whose cover  is  on Kahlen Aymes's website and I have to say it's beautiful. I seriously can't wait  to dive again in Ryan and Julia's story and see how it all works out. Their love story touched my heart.

The premise started out fine--an innocent being saved by outlaws and riding off with them, but I agree with the reviewer who said she sure makes a quick switch from virgin to wild and wanton.  Give me a Lora Leigh western any time.

$REVIEW.: Rylee's adventures in London continue, but this novel is MUCH better than book 3

Rylee needs to find O'Shea (Liam) but Liam is fighting his own battles between human and wolf


Some new characters are introduced in this book, and you learn more about the existing characters - including that what you thought you knew about them might not be true!  So many threads in this story, and Rylee has to follow all of them to find O'Shea, to find Berget..


and to find herself


 Because a quest that she has been on for 10 years may have been in vain, and it gets more and more difficult to tell who is good, who is bad, and who may be neither..


just forced into actions beyond their control.

$review_text.: SEALs are known for being intelligent and highly trained, tough, strong and calm in the face of danger.  And of course, off-the-charts sexy!  This is why we like to read about them, yes?  Pitting a tough SEAL against a capable, smart woman in a difficult situation is a staple of the genre.  But where some heroines cope with their situations by bucking up their courage and allowing the SEAL to do what he does best, this bimbo is constantly screwing things up. She brags about being a crack shot and then is utterly shocked and appalled when he suggests that she might want to hold the gun to protect herself against the guerrillas that are about to abduct them.  WTF?!  She constantly berates him for being rude and dismissive instead of appreciating his focus in keeping her alive.  And when there's conflict, she distracts and impedes him at every turn and then complains about their dire situation.The attraction was choppy and felt contrived.  There was so little opportunity for them to appreciate the pull of the other person but then give them 2 minutes alone in a shed and they nearly shagged.  It was just weird.I couldn't even finish this piece of junk.  Too bad because the male characters had a lot to offer in a series!  I like a gal with a little spunk but a smidgen of intelligence and common sense to go along with it would have been nice.  I'd skip this one if I were you.

I read the sample first, and thought - good strong female and male lead characters and action. But it went downhill from there, with everyone ending up paired off, and no surprises.  I don't mind romance, but this seemed rather juvenile.

$REVIEW.: An excellent read, extremely descriptive. You almost feel as though you are one of the characters. This is the first Novel that I have read by Jules Verne and will not hesitate to read further stories by him,no matter how far fetched they may have seemed when he first penned them.If you enjoy a bit of fantasizing I would have no problems in recommending that you purchase ,sit back and enjoy.

$REVIEW.: "Firebug" by Daniel Berenson simply blew me away. I literally had to stop and take some deep breaths while I was reading but then I rushed back to the story because I simply HAD to find out what was going to happen next to Curtis and Bobby.None of the other reviewers mentioned Bobby's desperation to have a friend which led him to cling to Ryan, who had all the makings of a future serial killer and who was really pushing Bobby to become an arsonist. Without his relationship with Curtis which really changed him, Bobby would have remained vulnerable to a person like Ryan in the future. In fact, the situation with Ryan was the only part of the book that I wasn't satisfied with because Ryan was very dangerous and there was nothing in the book about dealing with that very serious threat.Aside from that one point, I liked everything about the story. The imagery was outstanding; it was extremely vivid  and realistic and it felt like I was really taking part in the story with all of my senses involved. The characters, including the minor ones, had well-drawn and three-dimensional personalities. The dialogues were very authentic and the individuality of all the characters always came through so I never had to figure out who was speaking. The writing style was very smooth (and grammatically correct!) and the story flowed easily from the beginning to the end.I think that the story can be appreciated by a wide audience and that both children and adults would gain many insights from readingit. This would be a good book to share and talk about with others and I highly recommend that you get this book and read it ASAP.I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review which I have tried to give. I received no other compensation and all opinions expressed are my own.

$REVIEW.: Thiessen claims in this book that "enhanced" interrogation techniques helped foil the plot at Heathrow to blow up planes.  Peter Clarke, the head of Scotland Yard during 2006, stated that Thiessen's account of this is "completely and utterly wrong."  This ex-speech writer for Jesse Helms also claims that Abu Zubayah gave useful information about Jose Padilla only after being subjected to waterboarding and similar techniques.  Yet FBI Agent Soufan, who actually did the FBI interrogation (using the techniques that the FBI finds useful) got the testimony about Padilla long before the CIA waterboarded him.  See any of the many reviews of this book that debunk the outright lies that it peddles (New Yorker, Atlantic, Foreign Policy).Interrogation experts, like Robert Mueller, Michael Hayden, Chuck Hagel, John McCain and others have all stated that torture (and torture-lite) interrogation techniques do not work and are not at all reliable.Thiessen represents the worst of the Bush administration people who created and lived in their own bizarre imagined world of WMD in Iraq, being greeted as liberators, the last throes of the insurgency and interrogation expertise based on watching reruns of Jack Bauer.  They traffic in their self-delusional wish-fulfillments and theocratic invocations instead of logic, reason and evidence.  This book is a laughable work of fiction.

$review_text.: This book does contain very useful bits of information, and certainly for the price is worth considering adding to the library for any dedicated enthusiast. However as another reviewer suggested, the tone of this book really is more geared towards an aspiring professional gunsmith than it is for the typical DIYer who is looking to do basic tasks. Therefore the title of the book in my opinion is misleading.Another thing is that at least half of the information in this book is specialized. What I mean is that the tasks are geared for a specific project on a specific weapon. Certainly while the principles of a given job should carry over to similar rifles, it is a point worth considering for someone who is looking for more generalized knowledge.Also, some information I do not necessarily agree with either. Case and point is the section on cleaning. His basic idea of cleaning is that after 15-20 shots, the rifle should be cleaned essentially for every shot fired, and he suggests that the procedure (because of soaking times) can take up to a week to perform! In my opinion that is simply being too anal, and I doubt even necessary (hunting rifles) or even desirable (many will claim... and I tend to agree... that EXCESSIVE cleaning does more harm than good because of the wear and tear it creates). Never mind that realistically I think few people have the time or inclination to be that slavishly devoted to cleaning their weapons!Not bad, but overall I feel that for the DIYer, Sweeney's book "Gunsmithing Rifles" is a better choice.

 His analysis of human nature and how we all develop habits was so unique and intriguing to me since my number one interest is studying human nature and the human condition

 His section on habitual and automatic behavior is truly convincing and educational.When I finished reading Matt's book, I was somewhat stunt at the realities of human nature


As a professor, I found the book to have an academic flavor because all arguments are supported by facts and science and not mere meaningless opinions.Overall, this is a must read for those of us who wish to understand how and why we fall into habits and how we can can go through the change process smoothly and with understanding of each step.Great work, Matt.

$review_text.: I preferredWait for Me (The Montgomery Brothers), the story was more interesting and full of ups and downs. In this story the H is a busy businessman who feels that all the female staff are after him since his brother married his own assistant. He requests a married woman as his assistant so that he can avoid being targeted (he has already had a few disastrous encounters with previous assistants). His father fancies himself as a bit of a matchmaker and suggests the h, because she is a 'married' woman. The H and h go off on a long business trip and deal with a strong attraction to one another. There really wasn't much substance to this story and even the misunderstanding towards the end felt a bit contrived. I still enjoyed the story and will buy the final book in the trilogy when it comes out.

If you are like the rest of the world and have moved on to Tomcat 5 or 6, then forget it
This means the 2.1/1.2 Servlet/JSP specs rather than the 2.5/2.1 spec


From 1.2->2.1 there have been some powerful additions to the tagging which you obviously won't find any info on in here.I'll give the book 2 stars as it is well laid out, thought there are a few niggles where the content is wrong, but nothing major.

$review_text.: 4.5 StarsI like to read pretty much anything that is placed in front of me YA is no exception. I came across author Victoria Scott purely by accident and the first thing that caught my eye was The Collector, I knew I had to read it, not just for myself but I wanted to see if it would be something that my teenage son would read also. I was not disappointed in the least. I am 43 and I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of this book and I know that my son will also.Dante Walker you could not help but love him. He is all about himself a bad boy in life as well in death but as redemption comes to light you want to make him yours. He has a wicked sense of humor even when he is talking about his awesome self. He is very good at his job he is The Collector and the very best at it. He marks those souls that are bad with his seal and when the time comes they are collected for Hell. Now up for a promotion as director and a chance to stay on earth permanently he is given the task to collect a soul with in ten days.Charlie Cooper has led a solitary rough life but she makes the best out of everything. She is the ugly duckling in a sea of swans. Dante doesn't know what to make of Charlie or why the devil would want Charlie's soul she's hardly anything to look at. When he see into her soul he sees how bright she is, how pure but knowing this is his chance to remain on earth his bad boy comes out. Dante knows how to play dirty so he plays on her worst fear and even though he knows it's not right Dante only thinks of himself.As thing change and Dante gets to know not just Charlie but also her friends he learns more about not just her but himself and that beauty isn't just skin deep. It was his mission to take her soul now all he can think about is protecting it.I think everyone can find something in this book that will appeal to every age group as an adult reader this is the perfect combination of humor, romance and suspense, it's well written and you can't help but love Charlie and Dante. Not to mention the secondary characters make this an absolute wonderful read.Review copy provided for an honest review.

$REVIEW.: Whether or not the reader is a libertarian, he will learn a great deal from Radicals for Capitalism. This would be a great textbook for an Introduction to Libertarian Thought 101 class. Doherty covers the lives of many of the great libertarian thinkers, from famous authors like Ayn Rand and Milton to more obscure writers like Rose Wilder Lane. He discusses the contribution of libertarian economists, from Mises to Hayek to the radical Murray Rothbard. Doherty  also discusses the ideological and personal disagreemnets between various libertarians, (many readers may already be familiar with the disagreement between the Austrian and Chicago schools of economics).  I found little to criticize in this wonderful book.

There is strong language throughout but I feel it does work well due to the storyline.It is a quick read but one I absolutely loved.The story ends with the first few chapters of The Boy In The Band and I cannot wait to read it as this novella has certainly set the scene very well.

$REVIEW.: Delilah Dirk was advertised as an online graphic novel, rather than just a webcomic. I really enjoyed that description, because you can tell Tony Cliff had a different approach. The art was fun, the writing adventurous, the pacing perfect. It was magic. It was inspirational. It was love at first sight.If you've read through Delilah Dirk prior to getting this graphic novel, good for you what are you waiting for? If you haven't, boy howdy are you in for an adventure. Delilah Dirk shows its whimsy from the first page and pulls you by the arm until the end of the book. There are a few moments that are surprisingly touching, as well as a few edge-of-your-seat moments. Remember how I mentioned perfect pacing? This is a refreshing tale that has its ups and downs, rather than a 15-minute read/thrill-ride. I recommend brewing a cup of your favorite tea and dedicating an afternoon to this book.There's something spectacular about Delilah Dirk's art. The book opens with a brightly colored spread, assaulting your senses with a plethora of colors. Go ahead, open your book to the first page, pull it away from your face about a foot, and just breathe it in. It's almost like you can smell Turkey (though that's not something you'd want to do, given the time period). The novel isn't in excruciating detail, however. I'm talking a out the vibrancy of every page; like there's a living, breathing world and you are taking it in a glimpse at a time. This same quality follows every page thereafter and leaves you wanting more at the end. I've read Delilah Dirk about 7 times online and have gone back countless times just to appreciate the art. At this time I highly recommend checking out Tony Cliff's tumblr and checking out the post from August 29, 2013. It has a bunch of links and interviews of him describing his art process, flying boats, and fondness for pandas.Hopefully you will give Delilah Dirk a chance. It's a beautiful edition and isn't too expensive,  so grab yourself a copy and "you're welcome" in advance.

$REVIEW.: This novella has a wonderful paranormal romance story line


I thought the story was interesting and fun and the characters were easy to relate to and understand

Ryan and Natalie were sweet, likable characters who were greatly surprised by the paranormal elements that were about to enter their lives


The author did an excellent job of foreshadowing what paranormal elements were later going to surface for the couple as she writes the story of Ryan and Natalie's early courtship
My biggest complaint is that I felt like part 1 and part 2 should have been combined into one complete novel
I truly think that combining the two would have created a wonderful standalone book that could have been left where it ended or picked up later if the author decided to continue the story at a later date-which I hope she does since I still have several unanswered questions
I just don't see how leaving this in 2 separate parts really helps the story along


The cliffhanger at the end of part 1 actually made me mad rather than making me want to read part 2

However, I read part 2 a few days later simply because my daughter already had it on her nook.*I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

It's truly cool to know down to the nitty gritty what is a fabric made of and capable of. Right now, I'm considering the silks and the seacell.This is a very detailed book, well illustrated and all is explained. For example, one store told me that linen is hemp when in fact they are from two similar plants. This book is worth the effort.

$review_text.: I must admit to being a fan of Iza Trapani and have yet to read on of this author's books that has not impressed me
 `The Itsy Bitsy Spider" is not exception and is a delightful read-a-long for both groups and one on one
 The author has taken the old song (or rhyme) which is quite well known, and added verses which go well beyond the original:"The itsy bitsy spiderClimbed up the water spout,Down came the rainAnd washed the spider out.Out came the sunAnd dried up all the rain,And the itsy bitsy spiderClimbed up the spout gain."This was the little song I learned as a wee one, the one I taught my kids and then grandchildren

 It was and is the type of little song or rhyme you can do over and over again and go through hand motions to enhance it


 Kids love this thing.What the author has done is add several new verses to this old original, five of them to be exact


 She has the little spider climbing the kitchen wall, climbing up a yellow pail, climbing up a rocking chair, climbing up a maple tree and finally spinning her web at the very top of the tree.The art work here is delightfully done using soft and mellow colors and is actually quite detailed


The pictures are executed in a way that leaves a warm feeling when you look at them
 They, the illustrations, go perfectly with the text.The author has been kind enough, on the last page of the book, to include the music and all of the verses together.This is simply a fun read for the little ones and is one that you will want to do over and over again.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks

There is no dumbing down, but completely accessible vocabulary and action for Tweens, teens and young adults (or old ladies like me).

Kerri hit the emotional nail right on the head.It has it all, love, passion, typical teenage fun, but it also has the gut wrenching down side of a devastating disease that rips relationships and families apart.It&#8217;s written from both Harper and Vaun&#8217;s POV which I loved. I enjoyed seeing things from both sides and how situations are seen differently from each person.I cried, I laughed and I cried some more with his very touching book. In fact, its so well written I felt like I was actually there for most of it.My favourite part has to be the &#8220;pond&#8221; seeing Harper so carefree and happy was very touching.The part I cried most at, the ending. Kerri, just when I thought things couldn&#8217;t get any worse for this beautiful couple you did THAT! Total sob fest :&#8217;(Favourite character (other than Vaun *swoon*) has to be kick ass April, her sassiness at the pool party was off the chart!Kerri you touched my heart in more ways than one with this beautiful story and I love you for that, in fact I&#8217;m off to one-click all your books, just don&#8217;t tell my other half~Nicola~***This book was given free for an honest review***

Of course, once I realized there were other authors involved, I had to get their books and then read it all in order. This is the latest installment and centers around Ben and Marcus.I love Ben and Marcus. They've been through so much together and bravely come out the other side madly and passionately in love. I loved and adored meeting Frankie, Marcus' brother, and his kids. It's obvious the author has spent some time around children because he sure knew how to write the funny things they say!Oh, how I wished for a different ending, but Tom Webb wrote it beautifully.

The book makes a great case for not making big exciting goals but rather simple almost silly mini goals which become habits. Unlike most books on the topic making life chances this one logical and simple. The end result we all want is to have us do the things we know we should without all the discipline/pain that it takes to do them. This book shows us both how and why mini-habits are the easiest and most effective way to change your life for the best.

$review_text.: Mike McKinley's latest book, Did The Devil Make Me Do It?, is from a series of books called Questions Christians Ask which is published by The Good Book Company. This book serves as an introduction to those who are unfamiliar with the works and person of the devil and his demons. The book begins McKinley's conversations with friends who have worked in other countries where they have been real demonic forces at work. What is sad is that many Christians in America, 60% to be exact, do not believe the devil is real, but a lot more Christians outside the U.S. do believe he is real.The first chapter is about who is Satan and where does he come from. McKinley does a great job addressing Genesis 3 as Satan came in the form of a serpent and even addressed that Satan was not a self-sufficient being as God the Father. Satan was created by God an angel who worshiped God until one day he decided to be God, started a war with God, and was cast out of heaven. Satan is a also a real person and not a personification of evil as many people, including some Christians believe.The second chapter addresses Satan's activities. The Bible tells us how God works, so does it tell us how Satan works. He is a liar, he promotes false worship, and even tries to prevent salvation. McKinley makes it clear that Satan is not like God. God does not need anyone's permission to do whatever He wants. Satan on the other hand is a limited creature that needs God permission to do what he needs to do such as the case in the book of Job.Chapter 3 addresses a tough subject that many try to answer and that is on demon possession, which McKinley did a great job looking through the Bible and help the reader understand it. He even answered the question, can Christians be possessed by demons, which the answer is no. Once we are in Christ, we cannot be possessed by demons though they may tempted to cause to disobey God.Chapter 4 deals with how Jesus defeated Satan which for most Christians, sad to say, know that answer. Jesus defeated Satan through His finished work on the cross taking our place for our sin to suffer the wrath of God. In this chapter, McKinley addressed that the ransom Jesus paid for, as mentioned in 1 Timothy 2:5-6 and Mark 10:45, was not a ransom from Satan, but from God Himself. All of us owe a debt to God that we could not pay for unless we lived a perfect life which none of us could.Chapter 5 is about how Christians need to fight to Satan. The Bible says the devil roams like a lion (1 Peter 5:8), therefore Christians need to be ready and alert when he tries to come against us. McKinley tells us there are three things Satan cannot do: take away our salvation, make us do anything, nor read our minds. Remember Satan is not powerful as God though some Christians have made him look that way. McKinley even took the time to address if the devil makes us sin because there is that famous expression, "The devil made me do it" that people have used to excuse what they have done. McKinley says while Satan can tempt us to do evil, we are the ones who do the act.This is a great little book that all Christians must have. This will be a great resource in using when talking about the devil and his demons. McKinley does his usual stuff with adding humor in teaching theology truth.- See more at: [...]

$REVIEW.: This book is timely and has intellectual weight. It is a well-researched and well-written story of the eight German terrorists who traveled by U-boats to America and landed on the beaches of New York and Florida during World War II. The book outlines the terrorists' backgrounds, their motivations, the circumstances of their arrests, and an interesting view of their trial by a military commission set up by FDR. This book of history is a pleasure to read because it moves like a fast-paced novel with characters of depth. As for the legal analysis following the history portion of the book (i.e. Chapter 22 and following chapters), I make no comment nor take any position.However in the history portion, Pierce O'Donnell demonstrated that he is not only a great trial lawyer, but a great writer. Bravo!! A well-deserved 5 star read.

$review_text.: Have you ever wanted a book that was a down to earth organizing book? You know, not one of those books that you read and think, &#8220;That was nice, wish I could really do that.&#8221;Well, this is not one of those. Even if you are not a work at home mom, this eBook is worth the purchase.Tricia is a mom of 6, grandmother of two, yet has toddlers still at home that she is homeschooling. She speaks to how to balance your priorities, while taking care of yourself and your family. How to figure out what are the priorities for you and not just what they are for her.Tricia spoke at our local MOPS group many years back, and the topic that she taught on was one that stuck with me. She spoke on prioritizing your life and living deliberately. The one point that I really remember was her telling us that we are making the memories with our children today, not someday. I appreciate Tricia&#8217;s voice throughout this book. She is real. She tells you how it is and she doesn&#8217;t waste a lot of time or flowery phrases doing it. She lets you know that she works hard, and she has not gained perfection, but you can also see the proof. She has successful children that are grown and living lives that speak for how their mother raised them.I am so glad Tricia wrote this book. I wish it were in print form, so I could buy 100 copies to give away that is how good it is! Right now, instead, I am wracking my brain trying to figure out how to get it to my friends that don&#8217;t have an eReader! If you have an eReader, go and buy a copy! If you work at home, you will be blessed, but if you are just a mom that is juggling the many stresses of all you do on a regular basis, you will be blessed as well. This book is a must read for all mothers!

$REVIEW.: It's one thing to deal with normal teenage drama--it's another thing entirely to add to it the trials and tribulations of becoming a vampire. Blake is hungry and constantly trying to keep the rage at bay. Plus, she's in love with one vampire while bonded to the one who sired her.Unfortunately, her problems are mounting. She needs blood and the man in control of the blood supply, who is also the Chief of Police, is raising prices. There are other alternatives, but all come with a stiff price. Blake decides to make a stand. But who can she trust? And how far up does the treachery go?I love characters with spunk and spirit, no whiny teenage protagonists for me. Blake doesn't just sit in a corner and bemoan what life has handed her, and who could blame her if she did (at least for a little while). Instead, she comes out fighting.If you love paranormal stories with a strong female lead, you will love Blood Draw. Just be forewarned, it ends on a cliffhanger. But it's one with lots of promise. Book three is high on my most anticipated books of 2014 list!

$review_text.: I enjoyed the short story by Jack Skillingstead, so was happily surprised to recognize the story from glancing at the cover. That doesn't happen too often, say never. I was interested to see how the short story got worked into a full novel.The writer lost me when he came up with the idea of a white Christian preacher who wants to practice female genital mutilation on Kylie, the protagonist. The villain briefly mentions that he read about this in National Geographic, sidestepping the inconvenient fact that this is a cultural tradition from Islamist North Africa. Since writing anything negative about Islam or North Africa is not politically correct, let's assign this evil practice to a raping white Christian male!If we removed from the bookshelf all the fiction books that feature as villain a white Christian male, pushing his evil philosophy down everyone's throats, I wonder how many would remain. Even after the preacher got two bullet holes in his head, he still convinces her mother to go along with this adult mutilation. What does this have to do with aliens, again?It offends me when a writer shows they are out of ideas from the start of the book. "What to write about... I don't know. Let's make a Christian a villain specifically for his religious beliefs!"Why did the writer not make the villain the Imam from the local Seattle mosque? A fictional character should have nothing to do with worrying over offending a real religion, right? Then why are all the villains in fiction Christian? The cowed silence of modern authors is the true evil of political correctness. On the plus side, making the villain a Christian greatly increases the odds of this book being optioned into a Hollywood movie.If the author (or his fellow author wife Nancy Kress) does not know any Christians in their personal lives, I suggest they read another Amazon title, "Guns Up!: A Firsthand Account of the Vietnam War" by Johnnie M. Clark. The author professes the journey of his Christian faith in the most harrowing circumstances.

$review_text.: This is an amazing book, definitely one of the best books I've read in the past few years (and I read a lot of books!). It reads like a thriller: I could not stop reading and turning the pages until I got to the end. The plot has some many unexpected but logical twists and turns that are absolutely gripping. But it's not just any thriller. It's real literature, both in the topic and the writing style.Human trafficking is a real issue and a serious problem, and this book does an amazing job at showing how widespread and frightening the problem is. The characters involved in the story are interesting and realistic. I absolutely adored Gavin who is brave, smart, and manages not only to overcome his mild case of autism ( or Asperger's?) but use his more acute intuitive sense of people to his advantage. A lot of human interaction is in the tone of voice and non-verbal signals, not just words, and Gavin picks up on those signals well (better than "normal" people)  in his work and in his rescue missions.The whole idea of GPS tracking with the help of DNA was absolutely amazing to me. I'm not sure if it's reality or science fiction, but it sure seems possible. This book will thrill you, scare you, amaze  you, and make you think. Once you read it, you won't forget it. It's that good.

I like her history and that the family means as much to her as Brody does. Brody, the playboy of the family, doesn't know what hit him in the last year since he kissed Tori at last year's Christmas party. Tori knows exactly what hit her, love, but she isn't willing to risk her adopted family just to scratch Brody's itch. I loved that she wasn't a pushover for his lines. I also really loved that he was the one to get domesticated between the two of them first. Tori always knew it wasn't going to last, so she never even dared for that kind of relationship. It was Brody who dared to dream. Another great little story!I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest review.

$review_text.: By the author of The Glass Blower of Venice. Many of us like historical fiction in general, and if it's set in Middle-Ages Venice, so much the better. Here we get not only Venice, but a touch of Constantinople, as Feyra Adalet bint Timurhan Murad stows away on her father's ship to escape marriage to the Sultan (Murad III). Alas, Feyra is unaware of the ship's deadly mission, and ends up on a Venetian island while the city is stricken with the Plague. Woven into the story is the real life architect Andrea Palladio (born Andrea di Pietro della Gondola), commissioned to build a church so magnificent that it will cause God to lift the Plague from the city. For love interest, we have newly graduated doctor Annibale Cason who separates himself from the local quacks and sets up a clinic on one of the abandoned islands. Feyra was the doctor for the Valide Sultan (Sultan's mother) back in Constantinople--so you can see where this is going, though the ending might surprise you.

$REVIEW.: I mistakenly read this short book after Shortcuts. Chronologically, Shortcuts comes after. But this did not detract much from the stories. A few very minor details would have been clearer taken in their proper order.As with all the other Keeleyverse books, this was a fun romp, though a bit darker due to the plot: An evil demon has kidnapped a little girl and Santa Claus, and threatened to hurt or kill them if she is not given Santa's magic key. Keeley and Darla have to stop her, with help from Halley, Rebekah, Balthias, and a couple of new characters, a vampire Congressman and his young vampire assistant. Eve does not appear in this book. The new vampires are terrified of Keeley, which adds to the fun for us readers.The first three Keeley books appear not to have been edited or proofread at all. This one isn't quite as bad, but still is sloppy. But as with the others, I found that easy to overlook. A solid four stars, and a recommended fun, light read.

$review_text.: The label Screwball Comedy is usually put on a series of films produced in the 1930's, but it easily applies to this mystery, originally published under the pseudonym Freeman Dana.  It begins with Daisy Tower escaping in a laundry truck from a forced convalescence in her nephew's house and heading to New York to attend the opening of the 1939 New York World's Fair. Plot incidents from there fit well under critic Dilys Winn's description in the introduction to the trade paperback edition: "They drift from incident to incident with the style of the crash 'em cars at a carnival."  If you want only serious mystery novels, Taylor's books are not for you.  If you occasionally enjoy mysteries with a farcical touch, you will delight in Taylor's books, especially the ones written under the pseudonym Alice Tilton about Leonidas Witherall, who looks like Shakespeare.

New characters introduced, others dispatched...and the mystery continues.I hope this series doesn't stalemate at this point for the next six months.  That's what is frustrating about beginning a series that is in it's beginning phase, one just doesn't know how stable the writing is going to be or if each volume, book, episode, series, etc, etc, is going to take 6 - 8 months to come to fruition.  If that is the case with this series, then I'll wait until it is complete before moving forward.

$review_text.: One Bear is an excellent book for teaching kids how to count to ten

 Each page contains the spelled-out number, a large picture of the number, and an illustration of the corresponding number of animals

 This is accompanied by a humorous rhyme (Four lions, all named Brain, Five giraffes, who won't take a bath...).One Bear is easy to understand, and makes learning numbers fun
 It's a good book to share with kids ages 3-6.

$REVIEW.: I was prepared to be absolutely delighted by this book, but even after three tries it's still a did-not-finish for me. I adore historical romances, and m/m historical romances even more, but I could never quite get into Standish. Maybe it's the use of assault as a plot device, maybe it's the snoozefest characterization of the main character, or maybe it's how their chemistry always seemed forced. I'm just not sure. If you're looking for a good m/m historical romance, I'd recommend Lovers' Knot: An M/M Romance by Donald Hardy or one of Erastes' other novels, such as Transgressions: An M/M Romance.

$REVIEW.: Beth Wiseman's Amish novellas are available for the first time in one collection--Healing Hearts."A Choice to Forgive" Lydia has loved two men in her life. Daniel, who disappeared one Christmas Eve long ago, leaving only a note saying he wanted to live in the Englisch world. And Elam, Daniel's brother, to whom she had been happily married for 15 years. When Elam dies, Lydia gives up on ever loving again. But she is shocked when Daniel wants to return to the Order and her life."A Change of Heart" Leah is a writer in a community that does not encourage such fruitless endeavors. She lacks the skills necessary to be a good Amish fraa. Aaron knows these things about Leah, but his heart is captured by this spirited young woman."Healing Hearts" Levina Lapp and her husband Naaman are alone for the first time in 30 years. When Naaman left to visit cousins in Ohio, Levina wasn't expecting him to be gone a year. Now that he's back, will they be able to move beyond this estrangement and fall in love again?These novellas were previously published in An Amish Love, An Amish Gathering, and An Amish Christmas.I had the opportunity to read and review the e book version of Healing Hearts.  I was hoping for a light hearted, easy read and this book did not disappoint.  Each story carries a message of forgiveness and the healing in one receives when they are able to forgive those who have wronged them.  Each book also is honest in the difficulty it can be to forgive those who are closest to us after they have hurt us.  My favorite of the three was "A Change of Heart."  I could really identify with Leah's character and loved Auntie Ruth.  I also thought that the Amish recipes included after the book discussion questions was a very nice touch.  I am certain if you enjoy reading Amish  Fiction, Healing Hearts will leave you happy and uplifted.I received a complimentary copy of Healing Hearts from Thomas Nelson for the purpose of writing a fair and honest review.  I received no other compensation.

 This book is short, and works well to give you something that you can read in under an hour, and get plenty of enjoyment out of it

I would really adore you even more Ella. *HINT HINT*Well, my BODY was ready!!!!Finally I have Dylan and Isa back. I have missed these two so much I was hurting. I needed my fix.So, we take off I would say a month after the second book.Things get heated up pretty quickly... I love when Mistress Isabella comes out and plays. I love the switch, a true switch.Their relationship gets tested, Demons come to resurface, ass holes who need their balls chopped off come back.This book tortured me in the best ways possible."I love him so much and I want him to be pleased with my acquiescence and total submission.""True love, power exchange, contentment and most importantly, trust - have finally graced me with their presence and my life with Isa is complete."Overall this series is one of my all time favorites now. I felt a deep connection to each character from book 1 till now. I don't want their story to end.I would highly recommend this series. If you love BDSM that gets you all hot an bothered, then this is a must read. The writing is brilliant. Ella brings you into her own special world that will capture you and not let you go.Bravo Ella, Bravo. You did such a wonderful job.I received an ARC from the Author exchange for honest review.

$review_text.: Chances are you feel you've read books like this before. WHAT makes an idea work? WHO in an organization makes it work? WHY are idea practitioners not always rewarded or recognized? IS your organization stifling the flow of ideas or motivating ANYONE to come up with them?Yet, veering around interviews with 100 or so actual idea practitioners, this offering from Davenport et al has a very specific thematic intent and does a fabulous job of it. Below are some thoughts that form the spine of this brilliant work --(1) It is usually the same people who advance new business approaches at organizations. It's a whole class of people who have never been exalted to the status of high-profile business gurus (Porter, Tom Peters, Drucker, Hammer etc) despite being the ones to _actualize_ the ambitious ponderings of the Porters and Druckers of our world.(2) And no, rarities like Jack Welch may be more of an exception than the rule. Most idea practitioners are not on a fast track to the corner office. Most of them believe that they could probably have done better within the company if they had instead focused their careers on power and responsibility.(3) Yet, many of these people can't help themselves. They tend to gravitate to the jobs that have more intellectual content.(4) It is the contribution of these folk that gives companies competitive edges in times of an economic slump or industry stagnation/maturation, or even an elevated "perceived" business performance resulting in improved shareholder value and morale.(5) None of the above is conveyed in the form of fluffy business wisdom tripe. A smattering of examples from around the world support all the authors' theses -- failing K-Mart versus the expanding Walmart, the nearly bygone Westinghouse versus GE, Cemex in Mexico, Holcim in Switzerland etc.(6) Finally, amidst the profiles of the idea practitioners the authors attempt to offer a framework to evaluate and execute ideas. As for evaluation, they recommend running the idea through the litmus of the CLASSIC THREE of strategy (Efficiency, Effectiveness and Innovation). This does not come off as altogether fresh although the suggested framework is useful. As for execution, we are left more or less with the interviews and the thoughts therein.Overall, I'd say this is an engrossing book and the actual success stories are inspiring (perhaps a decent springboard for ideas too). The organization of the content could have been a little bit better but you don't have to be a true believer in the power of management ideas to appreciate the value of this book in our management thinking driven times.An important, interesting read.

The book is an excellent read, and I'd recommend if you haven't read either of these books go out and purchase one immediately.  I really appreciate Andy's pastoral heart and his excellent writing.  The book basically helps the reader understand the ins and outs of the things that are seeking to destroy us.  He includes plenty of Scripture and thought provoking insights to keep anyone busy digging into this book.  Stanley is an excellent communicator, and I wouldn't expect anything less than superb from him.

$REVIEW.: One may get amused by Pastor Prince's Singaporean accent.  Or by his homespun jokes or his youthful appearance...  But the content of his preaching is no joke.  Whether one agrees with his theology or not,  every Christian needs to examine these ideas very carefully.  The reason is that what Pastor Joseph Prince preaches may be the closest to the full Gospel taught by St. Paul.  Just re-read and cross reference the Book of Romans and other Pauline letters as well as the four Canonical Gospels as you read the Pastor Prince's book.  It is all there!Reading his first book, 'Destine to Reign' was a minor revelation to me and I could not wait to read this second volume by Joseph Prince.  If I can summarize his  first book with a phrase, 'No Condemnation in Christ', I can similarly title this book as 'Practicing the Presence of Christ'.  Two books expound how these two concepts are closely related and what they mean for Christians in their everyday lives.Pastor Prince books are easy to read because they are mostly based on his real time sermons.  But don't let the colloquial style fool you.  The issues he raises are extremely serious.  They go to the very center of Christian faith as lived everyday by Christians around the world.  Is Pastor Prince right??  Is his teaching really the closest to the Pauline Gospel??  That is the question each individual Christian has to carefully consider for himself with his Bible wide open.One conclusion I can draw is this:  If Pastor Prince's preaching is correct, the way to lead a victorious Christian life is surprisingly SIMPLE!  Read this book and find out.

$review_text.: Why did I choose 5 stars? Because I would never downgrade a religion or holy book just because they are different from my faith or my book, the Holy Bible. Mormons use both.  I am not a theologian, a historian, or a linguist so I cannot judge the content of any version of The Book of Mormon including this one.  I am simply a Baptist with a Mormon sister (biological and I pray 'in Christ'). My sister was having difficulty finding Bible verses on her Kindle. I spent a few dollars and bought The Book of Mormon and two versions of the Holy Bible so I could teach myself and then teach her. Now I have to convince her to upgrade from the Kindle e-reader to a Kindle Fire or convince my other two siblings to chip in so we can buy her one for her upcoming birthday!

Plenty of detail for me to start growing virtually any plant anywhere by growing my plants in a nutrient-rich solution, rather than in soil, and under controlled conditions of light, temperature, and humidity. (Hydroponics) Also often called aquaculture.Many people are like me and haven't the space for an outdoor traditional garden, or the conditions are not right for outdoor gardening. (To hot/cold or to dry/wet)I used this book to start my garden in my spare room and it's a pleasure tending my plants each day.All in all a well written guide with easy to understand how-to info.

$REVIEW.: I had put off reading this one because like other reviewers have mentioned, the cover isn't one that appeals, but I am glad I finally got to it.Our heroine has been in love with the hero since she was a young girl -- a skinny, red-headed, freckled girl -- who was too tall

 She is the best friend of the hero's sister, and that gives her an inside track.The hero consents to dancing with her at Almack's and discovers how much she has changed

 Her hair is a more becoming red, her figure has filled out and her height is surprisingly just right
The freckles are still there but seem more attractive than before
 And when her father decides to leave London and she comes to stay with her best friend, things move along quickly.The story is short, and there isn't any real drama -- but I think it is worth reading

 I recommend it.

$REVIEW.: The book starts off quickly, and pulls you in just like Neverlove did. You see that Abigail and Basil are still chasing their happily ever after, and that the Devourer is still causing havoc on earth with his plots and plans.And since the form of Father Quin has taken over the dubious honor of being the lord of Hell, part of those plots includes getting Abby back! Q has even enlisted Basil's mother into the plan, and has a new girlfriend for Basil.Abby meets another "former" Harvester, who saves her from getting run over. He's also there when her and Basil hit a rough patch after her seeing pictures that aren't quite what they seem. These pictures are on the camera that belongs to the other Harvester, who accidentally gave her his by mistake when he "saved" her.Over all, I highly recommend this novel. You still have the same characters you fell (or will fall) in love with from Neverlove. They All Fall Down has plenty of action, lots of suspense, and an ending that just might catch you by surprise! This book is a complete package, with a 4 star rating.

$REVIEW.: Angels, both exiled and heaven sent, keep humanity in check by either swaying or eliminating those people who are destined to bring great destruction to mankind. Olivier is an exiled angel in love with a human and is now responsible for her protection. But it won't be easy because there's another exile who has already tried to take her out once, and now Olivier must figure out who it is if he's to save the woman he loves.Charlotte Grace has somehow survived the fiery attack she sustained in Smoldering Embers and wakes up in the hospital, covered in bandages from head-to-toe. Olivier has been standing vigil the entire time, and when she is finally out of the coma, reveals some unbelievable truths about her past, his role in her life and ultimately, why he's there.Wesley and Paige play big roles, as her fiance and best friend, respectively. I really liked the tender moments Charlotte and Wesley shared, but not as much as the sexual tension between her and Olivier, especially during her recovery period.Charlotte is put through the ringer more than once and her life is always on the line, but she is never portrayed as weak. She appreciates the protection offered by Olivier and Paige, but ultimately stands on her own.You could consider this a standalone novel, because much of the pertinent points of the first part are revealed in Chapter one, but I think you'll have a greater connection with the characters and appreciate their development more if you read the books in order.Wild Fire is the second book in the Charlotte Grace series. It's fast paced, and well-written. If you're a fan of paranormal romance with angels and great suspense, you'll really enjoy this series.

$REVIEW.: I have often wondered about the third eye and if our higher self really does have any reality in our brains. I liked the author's straightforward explanation of the pineal gland-third eye connection and what it means to our consciousness.I have been exploring with several of the methods Dr. Jill details to open the third eye. I was already familiar with the meditation methods, but the tapping and acupressure techniques are easy and appealing.I think the most important part of the book to me was the extremely clear explanation of how my everyday motivation determines the level of consciousness I experience. This was an amazing and immediate life changer for me. I strongly recommend this book for anyone with an interest in higher states of awareness and consciousness.

$REVIEW.: The last chapter of David Platt's book included some helpful practical suggestions for every believer:1. Pray for the entire world2. Read through the entire Word3. Sacrifice your money for a specific purpose4. Spend your time in another context5. Commit your life to a multiplying communityAlthough this experiment is far from "radical", these "baby steps" include practical advice for believers who may be just getting out of the starting blocks in practicing their faith. Platt also encouraged believers to consider cutting back on luxuries or modify vacation plans in order to send funds to gospel-centered ministries that build up local churches.  For many, this is probably also good advice.The idea from the book's subtitle that we should "{take] back your faith from the American Dream" communicates that the American Dream is a toxic pool to avoid at all costs.  The American Dream brushstroke was painted so broadly and negatively in the book that anyone seeing significant fruit in his labor could be accused of needing rescue from the clutches of the American Dream.Normally by the American Dream we mean the prosperity that comes when people work hard and use their gifting in a context of a stable legal environment, respect of private property, limited government, etc. that over time excess capital is accumulated. History has proven that environments without these elements tend to produce less wealth than those with them. The capital is accumulated and used to build institutions where a young pastor can earn five degrees, a building large enough for a church of 4000, provide plenty of extra funding to send the pastor on trips around the world, and to give him enough extra time to write a book. Without the concepts laid by the American Dream David Platt would not have been able to write a book advocating that we take our faith back from the American dream.There is no doubt that many people inside and outside of America are preoccupied with too much or too little money. There are some helpful challenges and correctives in the book. However, let's not forget it is the love of money that is the root of all kinds of evil. I would suggest that in addition to recommending that believers spend time in another context for one week next year, Platt could do more to acknowledge that during the other 51 weeks people's labor and influence matter for the kingdom of God.  He should recognize and honor the impact on poverty that entrepreneurs and business owners have through employing workers, producing food, or creating the wealth that churches like Brook Hills can collect and send around the world.Radical introduces some helpful themes to the American church, but if you are interested in reading one book on developing ministry in your church, a much better selection is Ministries of Mercy by Tim Keller.

$REVIEW.: This book is still used and recommended by the Boulder Outdoor Survival School, possibly the most reputable school in the business.  Larry Dean Olsen, the author, is a guru in the field, and quite an amusing writer as well.  This book is a classic, having come out originally in 1967 (my copy is the 30th anniversary edition from 1997).  This is not a book for weekend backpackers, it is a text for those who want to explore and preserve true primitive survival skills - living off the land, friction fires, etc.  If that is what you are looking for, this book is a great choice.

It's an easy, one-sitting read that can be summed up with: "If you think you're a writer, you are. Start writing." The author's contention that writing alone makes one a better writer doesn't add up. Quantity does not equal quality. I received a free copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.

My husband as read many books by this author and has loved them and I would assume he would like this one too. For me, I think I will pass on reading this type of book in the future. I will say the writing was good and the story was put together good. Robert Liparlulo does manage to take you on an adventure with some unexpected twists though I found the beginning to be slow and it took me awhile to really figure out what was going on.

Using what he's learned in the past dealing with rinsers, he's turned himself into almost a vigilante. He's going other women that dupe men into giving them money. At the same time, another woman appears who seems too good to be true. She seems to like Peter. Can Peter let her into his life? What about all those skeletons in his closet or in Peter's case, rotting bodies in the garage. Can Peter really find his Happy Ever After?As I said previously, this is the shocking conclusion to the Peter Chronicles. I thought I could guess what was going to happen and I was totally wrong. I did not see that end coming. How will it end for Peter? Buy the book and find out.

$REVIEW.: Ah the philosophical musings of Chris Crawford...If you're looking for a Interaction cookbook- see Alan Cooper's about face 2.0 (isbn 0764526413), because this isn't that. Far from it. This is a book that seeks to stick an idea in your face and then get you to think about it rather than just spoon feeding you, like a good little pleb. Sure there's lashings of righteous indignation and condemnation aplenty (and given the state of some software it's not undeserved!) Again, provocation to think and construct mental arguments (or vocal if you're that way inclined) is not a bad thing. It's a very good thing: active learning is far more rewarding than passive acceptance.So Chris Crawford relates his thoughts, ideas, feelings, hates and a thousand other things in a rather amorphous form in this book. While it is not tightly structured (very waffling in parts), I don't think that is suffers too much from that- indeed the lack of totally rigid form often enhances rather than debilitates (flexibility!). Though he can struggle to fully chase the tail of an idea: perhaps that is deliberate, leaving it up to us to do that. And sometimes his thoughts seem misguided, incomplete or just plain wrong or couched in language that makes it largely inaccessible to some (odd coming from somebody trying to engage reader that they would choose such a tactic that prevents engagement). And yes, at times, you do get the impression that you are being ranted at or this guy is trying to talk down to you (a thesaurus doesn't make you literate- the ability to 'speak' to your audience and have them understand is far more of a yardstick (oops, I should say 'metric' to be up on the vernacular) in that regard).Content wise: there is a lot here that is of considerable importance. I particular like the chapter on 'Play', because as an educator (book he cites is Homo ludens: A study of the play element of a culture, Johan Huizinga), I agree whole heartedly with that and see that revealed in the mess some of my colleagues make of educating others by taking all of the fun/play out of it (I teach Mathematics and Physics). I also liked the simplicity yet depth of the 'speak-think-listen' notion. Too much nowadays it's all speak, little thought and no listen. And when that happens, we just MEGO (my eyes glaze over).At times he struggles to idea of how he tries to pull this unwieldy construct he has built into a cohesive pile (it's a concept like a slippery pig- grab it just so and you're okay, change your hold just a little and it's off...). Some of it is unneccessary: the clock chapter, dedicated devices, history of interactivity, why learn programming. Some of it is belabored: particularly behaviors, linkmeshes, linguistics, erasmus. Yet, ironically enough, they still make the book a richer experience because they provide context. And this is important. So while is writing style may not be perfect, his approach has much merit. And I think the book works. It seeks to not only open your eyes to interactivity, but provide some philosophical underpinnings for adopting a proactive approach when trying to incorporate that into design mindset. In other words, it seeks to put interactivity at the center of the things you do, not as an add on.And I think Chris Crawford does manage to get that message across (if a little self-importantly and in a stilted manner). I think, while his love of language is fairly obvious, his choices in this regard can be a little poor at times and self-aggrandizing, which can place barriers on your acceptance of his work. Just bear that in mind and factor some of the language and tone out, because if you do, I think you can get a lot from this book.

$REVIEW.: In `Runaway Storm' by D.E. Knobbe, you're swept along on an exhilarating adventure with Nate who decides to take the fate of his summer into his own hands. Nate, our 17 year old protagonist, has been forced to deal with the misfortune of his parent's separation. Much to his dismay, Nate has been forced to move away from Canada to New York where his mother took a job and a new boyfriend. Nate is looking forward to him and his father spending the summer together on a much anticipated kayak adventure. However, when Nate finds out that his summer plans have been blown out of the water, he decides to take matters into his own hands.D.E. Knobbe is a wonderful writer. The words flow together in a wonderful sea of perfection. Knobbe really understands and relays adolescence coming of age in `Runaway Storm'.This book is a page turner that readers of all ages will appreciate. Younger readers will also relate to the feelings portrayed by Nate.This book screams `rite of passage' as young Nate makes the trip of a lifetime and one that he won't soon forget. He meets many along the way who help him reach maturity and some who are dangerous. He navigates through one of the worst storms of his life, both physically and mentally.D.E. Knobbe has a winner with her Runaway Series. This was one of the best, most action packed, heartfelt, realistic books that I've read in a long while. I can guarantee that you won't be dissatisfied with this one. Pick up a copy or two for the young adult in your life. I myself anticipate the release of `Runaway Fire'. It can't come out fast enough and once it does hit the shelves, I'll be eagerly waiting in line with my copy.

$REVIEW.: I'm not a fan of short books, and I do appreciate that this is not one of those ripoff short short things you read in15 minutes.I believe the problem is the lack of an editor.  Yes there are some simple typos, but that isn't what I mean.  A good editor gives another perspective on what is important to the plot vs what  is just babble.This story would have been good at a half or third the length.  The rest is padding, unnecessary to the plot, unpleasant to wade through, and mostly the author just being in love with her own purple prose.Besides that, it took forever to read - not in the sense of being particularly long, but in the sense of the reader becoming intolerably bored in the middle of the endless droning and putting down the book to go do something much more interesting, such as cleaning the mildew out of the catch pan under the  refrigerator.

$review_text.: One of the things I like about the Dummies series is the format

You know what you are getting - while some of the authors do a better job of it than others - you're expecting a primer, a comprehensive introduction
Unlike some other cookbooks I've reviewed recently (notably, Ani Phyo's book) - this one is very factual and filled with real cooking science & nutritional information
There's not any self-indulgent rambling, New Age nonsense or pretentious/vain photoshoots of the author(s) looking ridiculously thin & pious while eating something on a streetcorner clad in pricey Lululemon yoga togs.In fact - there aren't many images at all! The book is jam packed with great information, tutorials and recipes

There is even a meal plan for a 4- week program to transition to raw or just to lose weight & try out a lot of recipes.While I would not consider myself a beginner - I did learn some interesting facts and quite admire the clean, methodical & organized way that the authors have presented the content


This is a book that I would happily pass along to my 65 year old mom or her 70 year old sister and feel confident that they would be up and running within a week, whipping up delicious raw nut cheeses and other goodies.However, I'm not handing off this book because I want to try some of the recipes - there are some great recipes for the dehydrator as well as some nice sauces, dressings and other items

I get the sense that some of the recipes are similar to the Cafe Gratitude cookbook - but, when it comes down to it - there's only so many ways to soak almonds and make pate and some are much more popular to our palates than others.I highly recommend this cookbook as your first raw/vegan cookbook - great information and instructions that will ensure success, hence, delight & enjoyment.

$review_text.: I must say that I bought this book simply because it was written by an author that I'm very familiar with and her work has been impeccable with EVERY novel.  I didn't read the reviews as I always do or even look to see what the book was about before I ordered it.  When I got the book in my hands, I read the back and wondered "What in the world is she doing???"  The reading on the back of the book in no way tells what this book is really about.  This is one of the best books that I've read in a long time (my bookshelf holds over 200 novels) and I must say that in my opinion, this is her best work to date.  The book is so good from the beginning to the end that you won't want to put it down!!!  I cannot say enough about this great love story.  I would recommend anyone who has a love for romance novels to BUY this book; you will not be let down.
$SUMMARY.: Simply Amazing!!!

$REVIEW.: A bit more cartoony at times than Malmborg's masterpiece, Jimmy, but Text Message was still a fun don't want to stop turning the pages read.  Basic plot revolves around a teen girl who gets sent text messages and video of her 13 year old sister in the trunk of a car.  The text's tell her to do initially embarrassing things, if not Jenna will lose fingers.  The texter tells Mallory that she can win this game, but if she calls the police or tells anyone else, Jenna will die.  Now you do immediately think why doesn't Mallory just call the police when she's alone in a bathroom or something and get them to trace Jenna's phone while she plays the sickos game, but the world is full of people who aren't the brightest, and your traditional kidnap note to parents at home usually has the same message which is often obeyed.This is a multiple through the eyes in the mind of different characters point of view read.  Obviously most of the pages are devoted to the texter game master, as well as Mallory, but you've also got Dan another security guard thrown in for fun.  I think the overall reading experience missed out on something though, by us not experiencing the tale through Jenna's eyes as well.  I also wouldn't have minded a look into the mind of the girls' mother, as she was a pretty pathetic character and I would have liked to have read what was going on in there.There are a few plot holes like surely individual stores would have their own security including alarms and cameras.  But that sort of thing doesn't really impact the fun.  I'd rate this one four and a half stars.  If you haven't already done so, definitely check out Malmborg's masterpiece, Jimmy.

$review_text.: After the ending of the first book in this series I have to say that I was slightly disappointed in the way that the situation panned out. I was expecting there to be more of a confrontation, what actually transpired was a bit of a let down to the situations that I had envisioned in my head!! Saying that the rest of the book&#8230;WOW!!Like the first book the character of Gavin is slowly opening up to us, a bit like slowly opening an enticing package!! This time around we still have the same Gavin but through comments made we get a bit of an idea that Gavin has a past, perhaps one to be ashamed of due to his reluctance to share (this is me purely speculating though). The biggest insight into Gavin came at the end, and I mean right at the end, as in the last line&#8230;. Yup this author knows how to leave a reader with their mouth hanging open with a long drawn out &#8216;nooooooo&#8217; going through your mind!!!Unlike the first book I have to say that the story in this didn&#8217;t grip me as much as the first book did, I enjoyed it immensely but have to say was disappointed that the Club didn&#8217;t feature in any way other than in a brief conversation. The sex scenes in this book, for me anyway, far surpassed those of the first book. They were H.O.T, seriously I am still panting just thinking about them! The fact the the cliffhanger ending came right on the heels of one of these encounters made the timing that much&#8230;more, for want of a better word.All in all this series is shaping up to be a great read with two leads that you cannot help but like. There are another 3 installments to come and I cannot wait to find out all of Gavin&#8217;s secrets, my mind is coming up with all different situations as to what the truth is, I have an idea but it could be me reading too much into something, I guess we&#8217;ll find out!Please note I was given a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

$REVIEW.: "...He's not built for hunting and killing like eagles are. He's a scavenger, a cleaner in the wild... he can eat as much as forty per cent of his own body weight....His body is a glossy black with wing covers of ivory grey. The secondary and inner primary feathers are ashy white and tipped in black, forming large white areas on the huge wings when seen from above. The condor's neck and head is red to blackish with no feathers. The male has a black, large, fleshy wattle over the beak, called a caruncle and he's designed for soaring high up in the sky, as high as 8000 metres... The female produces only one egg every second year. They nest on ledges amongst steep cliffs which are sometimes easy to get to, often very ex-posed. The young will leave their parents after the second year, when they will then have another egg, but the young won't mature until their eighth year and are then ready to lay their own eggs..."(p. 36)Talon,Come Fly With MeBy Gigi SedlmayerGigi Sedlmayer has provided us with a novel that is perfect for anybody from 9 to 99...and even younger children will enjoy hearing it read to them, since some parts may not be easy enough to read on their own. Certainly any grade school child will be intrigued by the main character's best friend! Let me tell you more...Matica was a very special daughter in a missionary family that had moved to the small remote village of Pucara in Peru. Matica was special because, although she was much older, she had never grown more than, say, the size of a 2-year-old. When her family moved, Matica discovered that the native Indians had never seen an individual such as she and they avoided her almost completely. Although Matica loved her family, she missed having someone to play with. She began by watching the many beautiful birds surrounding her home, especially admiring the dragonfly and hummingbird.But then she met two other birds--birds that were bigger and quite strange to see--but Matica thought they were beautiful! She talked about her new friends with her brother Aikon:"Stretching her hand to tap it with her finger, she wrinkled her forehead and said impulsively, really falling into self-pity now, `Some animals are so small some humans are as well,' she grumbled very softly. `But others can be so big.'"Aikon looked at her seriously for a few seconds, not cracking a smile. Finally he said, `You mean your condors, Tamo and Tima, and you as well?'"Hmm, big, Tamo and Tima, small, me.' She sighed. `I feel smaller than them. Why do I have this growth problem? Why can't I be like you - normal?"When Matica got discouraged, she would talk to her mother. One day, her mother told her she would someday come to understand and see the advantage of being so small...Matica had worked hard to become friends with the condors. She would carry dead animals to feed them and spend time talking to them...finally, Tamo had come down and started taking the food and eating...Then Matica realized a wonderful thing--Tamo seemed to understand what she said to him and he started to make sounds in response. But then one day Matica heard shots and saw Tamo! She ran toward where he was but then had to stop and hide. She had seen these men, poachers, last year!In Matica's mind, there was no choice, she had to help, save Tamo and Tima, as well as their egg! But how?This evolves into a wonderful adventure story that is so exciting that the entire village gets involved!You can too...you'll read how the egg was protected by its parents, and then how Tamo chose to ensure its safety... What's more, you'll meet Talon, their new son! But, most importantly, readers will learn how Matica came to realize her advantage to being different in size! A truly remarkable, heartwarming story that children and adults both will find an exciting adventure!Book Received ViaFacebook's Reviewers RoundupGABixlerReviews.

$review_text.: Rescue My Heart has loneliness, longing, desire and disappointment, and for Hack and Rory, of course the happy ending. In other words, all the ingredients of an engaging romance. I particularly liked the presence of dogs, including the aspect of rescue. Baxter, the heroine's pug is ever-present, providing company and comfort as only dogs can do when things go wrong. The author has a most amusing way of ensuring the hero and heroine are together, forcing them to overcome their hostilities early in the story. I found this was an appealing read and look forward to another in the Manhattan Dinner Club series.

If you are dedicating such a big part of your time and money to a person, it's not a big deal to make sure they are not out cheating on you. I've been cheated on in the past and not a day goes by where I hate myself for not seeing it coming. The signs were there, and after it was said and done, I looked back and it seemed so obvious. After giving this book a read, I know a lot more about what signs might indicate infidelity. Some are obvious and some are not. I'm happy I found this.

$REVIEW.: This would have to be my all time favourite book.  It has really affected me deeply. I was completely drawn into this amazing story of heartbreak, strength, courage and unconditional love.I have found it very difficult to write a review for Black Box without giving too much away.  In all honesty, you just have to read it!!!!This book had me mesmerized from page one right through to the very last page. Mikki and Crush are the two main characters in Black Box.  Mikki has endured much agony in her life to date and not only struggles to deal with events from her past but also suffers from a mental illness which makes everything so much harder. Crush has also suffered tragedy and great sadness and through it all has the heart of a gentle lion.  You will instantly come to love them as I have and feel their pain, heartache and sorrow and share in their happy times and triumphs.  Fate is a big player in this book as you will see. Two of my favourite quotes from the book were &#34;Do not be afraid; our fate cannot be taken from us; it is a gift.&#34; and &#34;Fate can save you and it can kill you&#34;.I shed many tears when I read this book, but there were also times of great joy and laughter and to finish, I have one more thing to say...I will never eat the top of a muffin again!!!Cassia Leo has written an absolute masterpiece!

The characters are clunky, the situations contrived, and the guilty party obvious after a few chapters. A lot of people like this book and find the spunky Ms Dodd appealing. but I wouldn't bother.

$REVIEW.: After reading this award-winning author's literary short story collectionCorazonesI decide to try this novel.I'm so glad I did. It is excellent so far! I'm very pleased. It's like I'm there, in Russia, with this mother trying to save her daughter, and dealing with the horrible health care system. I mean when she got to the part where the doctor explained she hadn't been paid in two months and that the government was trying to pay her in bathrobes I found myself talking out loud to my kindle. And I haven't even gotten to the spy part yet.To think, I almost didn't buy this book because of the cheesy title. Don't let that make you miss out on this fabulous novel. Ms Sherwood-Fabre's personal experience living in Russia is evident, and contributes to the setting in this novel. It feels remarkably realistic. Her skills as a writer shows in the deft selection of detail she chooses in each scene. The book is so well done and vivid, that as a reader I find myself carried away. That's good writing! And excellent storytelling.

$REVIEW.: If it had been possible, I would have given this 6 stars!  This might be the best Jim Swain has done.  I keep thinking the same thing every time I read a new novel by him.  He has really done his research on this one.  Such a work into the mind of a serial killer.  I actually had goosebumps reading this.  The scary part was that there really are people like this out there.Mr. Swain knows how things work, and how police work.  The GPR (Ground Penetrating Radar) that he includes in his story, really works, just like he describes.  It was used in Vietnam to find the tunnels that were used by the Vietcong.  The equipment is designed for industrial use for finding underground objects.  He also has done his research on the psychology of serial killers.  All this is woven into the story and brings the reader right into the scene.  Effective and frightening at the same time.I had some early A.M. reading on this, couldn't put it down.

The story is set in Appalachia. I'm a Tennessean, Scots-Irish, and I love bluegrass.

$review_text.: This was a fantastic book. This is the story of a high school graduate that flies in from supposedly Italy into the United States. A scan of her face comes up that she is Fiona Sullivan who disappeared 12 years ago on a family vacation in Italy. She was adopted when she was a baby to the Sullivan's. She states she is Francesca but when they caught her at the airport she had several different identification on her. She also failed several polygraph tests. She had to spend 2 months in holding by the FBI and then she has to spend 7 weeks with the Sullivan's until Fiona Sullivan turns 18. Brody Mason, neighbor to the Sullivan's and bad boy of the town, never stopped missing Fiona. Her disappearance caused him to become angry and then when his parents died when he was 15, he just became more angry and mean. The only people he cared about were his brothers, one older and two younger. He always knew Fiona was his soulmate. This is a really great story that shows what happens to a family when members disappear and for a person that knew you were meant to be with someone and they are no longer there. Definitely worth a read.

$REVIEW.: One of the most unorganized writing i have ever tried to read.  I almost gave up at times.The writing does not follow a linear path, it jumps around in concepts and mood, similar to the experience of listening to someone who has untreated ADD.When there is a scene change, there should be more space separating the paragraphs. Otherwise it reads like stream of consciousness.The story?  Slow, implausible, maddening but the real star of the book is the setting.I can not in good conscious recommend this book, but it did make me want to go to Greece.

$review_text.: Author Harry Shannon already has one great franchise protagonist -- the part-time detective, full-time radio therapist Mick Callahan (Memorial Day, Eye of the Burning Man), but now he also has brought aboard one Jack Burke, troubled ex-Ranger, part-time spook, part-time mob thug (with a heart of, you guessed it, gold), and full-time tilter at windmills.Burke and Callahan share some similar background -- Callahan washed out of the SEALs, while Burke was a Ranger in Somalia in the 90s and apparently also participated in fairly secretive ops in various hot-spots (such as South America), thanks to his continued association with a CIA spook from the old days. Burdened with a wife on life support and the associated medical bills, Burke can't turn down jobs, even if they mean stepping over the line of legality. He attempts to come down on the side of the good guys in most cases, though, for instance refraining from breaking a priest's limbs when payment of a gambling debt is slow in coming. Burke shares his knight-errant tendencies with Callahan -- both obsess over doing the right thing, and Burke meditates and philosophizes about his violent past and even more violent calling (which he perversely enjoys).One of the survivors of Burke's Somalia special ops team is Scott Bowden, a good cop slowly gone bad due to poor decisions and an association with a shadowy underground group not above killing innocents and using cops and the mayor's office to cover it up. Bowden passes jobs on to Burke, and this one revolves around a Stephen King-like author found dead in a hotel suite, apparently the result of a bizarre suicide. The author's daughter wants to know what happened to make her father engage in grotesque self-butchery. Soon, Burke needs to learn why the case is endangering everyone he knows.The author's gruesome death and its meaning lead Burke down several paths into his past, one of which is a woman he loved before his marriage and another of which was a target of an earlier secret op. Several threads tie together as one would expect, though one or two are left loose. A few quibbles: the mob guy's too much of a pushover at the most opportune time, a tense scene near the end is too easily defused, and part of the ending seems suddenly rushed. However, a weird cult, some unexplained street deaths, well-choreographed fight sequences, and an explosive Bondian climax help make The Pressure of Darkness a solidly entertaining thriller hybrid with roots in the horror camp, a toe in the noir camp, and just a hint of sf influence. All in all, the novel works splendidly to introduce a hero just shady enough to be interesting and just heroic enough to please fans of other "lone wolf" type adventurers - Reacher, Rain, Rambo, and even Parker come to mind, though the list is potentially endless. Good stuff!
$SUMMARY.: Mick Callahan Rules!

$REVIEW.: This is not your typical rocker romance
 Even though this is a small-town girl moves to the big city type book, what happens to her when she gets there is ANYTHING but your average story line
 All of the characters are so intriguing, and I can't wait to understand what's REALLY going on with all of them in the books to come!  (For real, there are some CrAzY characters in this book, and I REALLY want to know why they're acting the way they are!)This DEFINITELY has a cliffhanger, but we won't have to wait TOO long for the next one!

$review_text.: I received a complimentary copy of this book as a part of a book tour in exchange for a fair and honest review. I rated it 5 out of 5 Stars and a Recommended Read.The second book in a trilogy, Together in Starlight gives us the ongoing story of Cassie Wallace and Bennett Saville's ongoing love affair. Introducing a handful of new characters, a couple of mysteries, and adding a slight touch of paranormal flair, Susan Mac Nicol's story easily captures your attention and doesn't let it go. A great addition to this trilogy, I'm now anxiously waiting for the third book.As the story begins, both Bennett Saville and Cassie Wallace are in Tibet for a movie Bennett is shooting. Together for a little over a year, Bennett and Cassie's relationship is going strong and both of their careers are doing well. Bennett's cinematic star shines brighter than ever and they've recovered from the events which took place at the end of Cassandra by Starlight (you can read my review here). Planning to return to England and their normal lives, neither Bennett or Cassie plan to be involved in any more mysterious or dangerous situations, especially any needing the involvement of the police. No matter how well one plans though, unexpected surprises and situations have a way of popping up, especially when Bennett and Cassie are involved.Back home in London, Bennett and Cassie return to their everyday lives and get drawn into several unique situations. First, Bennett and Cassie find themselves being drawn into providing protection for Erica, the wardrobe designer/mistress at the Valedictorian, &#34;the Val&#34;, their theatre. Her abusive ex has re-appeared in her life and is making serious threats against her and her daughter. Just when Bennett and Cassie help resolve that situation, they find themselves the target of someone from Cassie's past - someone she never expected to see again. They also find themselves becoming involved in some behind the scenes &#34;ghostly&#34; shenanigans taking place at &#34;the Val&#34;.While Bennett and Cassie are involved in all of the action, and it's very well paced, Ms. Mac Nicol also gives us insight into their ongoing romance. While deeply in love, both Bennett and Cassie are human and it's wonderful to see how Ms. Mac Nicol has them work through their issues. Cassie still worries a little about their slight age difference, while Bennett worries his &#34;artistic&#34; temperament might drive a wedge between them. Then there's the added pressure of Cassie's health concerns as a result of her previous injuries. I really like how their characters continue to develop, both as individuals and as a couple. I especially like Cassie and could see myself wanting to be her friend if she were real.Will Bennett recognize the real danger the person from Cassie's past brings? Will they be able to solve all of the mysteries and manage to stay out of the press? You'll have to read Together in Starlight to find out. I can't wait to read the next book to see what happens next, I especially hope we get to see their pending wedding.

$REVIEW.: I loved Breesan, Marcus, Morgan, Anna, and Tristan.  Each had a strong presence and were vital to the story.  I especially loved the chapters during Breesan's birthday party when the events were told through Breesan, Marcus and Morgan's view.  The only reason that I didn't give the book five stars is because it was very wordy.  There were a lot of moments of no dialogue and too much description, and I found myself skipping through sentences and paragraphs to get back to the action.  I just downloaded Book 2 and I can't wait to start it.

$review_text.: The first volume of "Dororo" has been put together by Vertical with wonderful aesthetics.The story itself is fairly self explanatory; I'm sure if you've read this far you already know that it's protagonist, Hyakkimaru, is in search of his body parts, each protected by a demon which he must first kill. Sold off by his father in infancy, Dororo is picked up by a doctor and given prosthetics -- arms, legs, eyes, the whole works. He trains with them and eventually becomes a skillful swordsman without the use of any natural body parts (his own arms are actually swords!). Tezuka does a wonderful job of keeping the pace up. You never go more than a few pages without Hyakkimaru drawing his swords (uh, arms).At just three volumes, Vertical could've easily published this as one single work. Hefty though it would've been, given the right (read: hardcover!) treatment, I'd trust it in the hands of Vertical. Otherwise, the publication is beautiful - sturdy cover, intricate and graphic cover art and Tezuka's drawings are all intact. This is some truly beautiful stuff to look at. I go about snatching up any Tezuka I can find and while this doesn't stand apart from things like "Apollo's Song", it's Tezuka nonetheless and that means it's better than 90% of anything else your comic-loving hands could find.Volumes 2 & 3 look to be even better and with the upcoming re-publication of "Black Jack" forthcoming, it's a great time to fall back in love with Tezuka!

$REVIEW.: I did not read the other books in this series as I'm a fan of Sarah Mayberry and have no idea who the other authors are. It worked out just fine to read this as a stand-alone.It's a short but good story about two people who have been attracted to one another for some time. She is engaged to someone she thinks is &#34;safe&#34; (as opposed to her father who left her mother for someone else) but he's found to have slept with a student. Maybe someone not so safe is a better option?Great characters, hot and sweet love but a bit on the short side. Things were solved rather quickly. But all in all a great read.

$REVIEW.: I really enjoyed this book. Jessica Frances is a brilliant writer, who keeps her readers on the edge of there seats throughout the entire book! the characters were wonderful and the storyline awesome, I loved the invasion it brought to mind alien movies like incandescence day and such as the battles were just as epic.I liked that Marduke struggled with his loyalties and didn't just give them up for the girl. This showed he was a well rounded character and it made him appear more human. Mattie was a strong, loyal, independent person but you could see her vulnerable sides at times and I liked that, especially when her friends where in danger or threatened.Lisa and Hank cracked me up! who hooks up in the middle of the end of the world? they do!...lol...they were so sweet and Hank really liked taking care of Jess as she was a complete pile of tears, but you could see a hidden strength in Lisa that when it came right down to it she could be brave to save her friends and others.If you haven't read this I highly recommend it! a great read for any Alien fans out there!

$review_text.: `C through Marriage' by Jim Hughes is a positive and uplifting book backed  by scripture. It is a book that is perfect to be given to newly engaged/married couples and to couples that have been together for years. For the newly engaged/married couples, it gives a good look into what marriage is truly like. Not the glossed over, romanticized version some adults have grown up believing marriage is. As for the married couples that have been together for years, it is an ideal book to revisit what your marriage is now as opposed to what you expected it to be and what is still can become.`C trough Marriage' is written in short chapters, each starting with a possible real life scenario and going into what God intended marriage to be and how to go about reaching a Godly marriage. Bible verses are given throughout each chapter, so you'll want to have your bible handy.While I feel that I have a great marriage, this book made me realize that it could be even better.  I caught myself wanting to stop reading so I could start working on making my marriage more of what God intended, but I'm glad I didn't stop...because with each chapter, I learned so much more.I found this book to be right on the mark. I encourage every married couple, whether you feel your marriage needs help or not, to read this book. This is also the perfect book to have on hand to be given as an engagement gift. If it encourages communication to start before the vows are taken, so many negative issues can be avoided after the vows.Ursula Gorman- author of `Old Acquaintances' a mystery/romance to be released Dec. 10/Jan. 11

$REVIEW.: Stanley Shulze came to Boulder ten years ago. He had a business degree , a minor in art and a job as a yarn buyer. He spent the good part of that time, going to all the night spots, clubbing, and sexing. Life in Boulder was different from where he came from, Boulder offered a great gay community and he was going to enjoy every minute of it!Rance Crawford made deliveries to the yarn shop called Ewe'll Love This, where Stanley worked. Stanley eagerly noted Mr Crawford checking him and his fine butt out on his first visit. That was the day he sorta became exclusive without thinking about it.  Five years Stanley and Rance had this adventure in the bathroom or the delivery closet with a condom and a bottle of lube. This all ended when Rance met a nice guy and settled down with Ben.Stanley looked out the window of the yarn shoppe, wondering how this all happened. He did not want that " club scene" anymore, and if he was ever going to meet some one, that was where he needed to go back to; as he shuddered. Leaving town was not an option, he had roots here after ten years and loved Alice the owner and his boss. After selling yarn to  old and young alike, he decided to become a `user' and learn more about the craft than the seed stitch. It was the day before Thanksgiving....when he bought two skeins of wool and some needles. Now after his first attempt at a scarf, he was a Knitter !Rance and Ben came to the shop on Black Friday to ask Stanley for a favor. Adriane, very pregnant was being sent to the hospital in Boulder for complete bed rest and they asked if Stanley could stop in on her for company. It was then Stanley realized "Being by yourself meant you weren't by yourself after all".  He now had a purpose. With Adriane out of Rance's shop, Aiden and Jeremy would stop delivering and he would have a new delivery guy. Oh my my...enter Johnny.Too bad Stanley was in such a hurry to get to the hospital, he fussed and berated the "new delivery guy" and actually called him Jethro. The scene is hilarious until he looks up into those beautiful brown eyes when Johnny calls him "cupcake" and he sees the eye candy and his mind says Holygodshootmenow !Amy you have done it again, brought me to the brink, allowing me into a little world you have created with loving folks that inhabit this little piece of Boulder Colorado. Of course the road you take us on is not always smooth,  as in life. The possibility the past can come back to bite a person is always there, the world is not always pretty, it can be a scary place and people sometimes suck. But after you have pulled us over the hot coals of angst and fear, we can always depend on you to also let us feel love and family and hope.I love your writing Amy Lane, there is no story I do not gain something from. I commend your honor, your skills and your love for writing...Keep it up and that will keep me a reader.Review by Gloria LakritzSr Reviewer and Review Chair for the Paranormal Romance Review Team

$REVIEW.: There is no doubt that the author is seeing some things way beyond the standard archeology community.  The problem is that his writing style is very droll.  He could also get his message across using about half the number of words.  He frequently repeats his themes and suppositions many times.In this book he is partly hiding behindEgyptian Hieroglyphic Dictionary, Part 2as a major part of his justification behind his associations between Dogon and Egyptian words.  He also, repeatedly, refers to his just previous bookThe Science of the Dogon: Decoding the African Mystery Tradition.  You end up with the feeling, that not only is the current book not so interesting, but that it should have been included as a couple of chapters in the previous.  Readers curious about new thinking about ancient Egypt will be more fulfilled sticking to John Anthony West and Christopher Dunn.

The author's unique view of the zombie virus made it different enough from all the others to add variety.  The main character undergoes quite the personal transformation from the beginning of the book to the end.All the people he meets along the way just adds to the enjoyment, and I am looking forward to reading the rest of the books in the series.  The only problem I had is that the characters are more like robots, and the laws of physics and biology are suspended way beyond the bounds of belief.  If you don't mind people who suffer no effects from lack of sleep, food, water,endless battles, or exhaustion, it shouldn't be a problem.

$REVIEW.: I'm selling "Wintertide" to a used bookstore in perfect condition


 I'm glad so many people have really enjoyed this novel, but the total lack of negative reviews bothered me -- I just don't think this is a five star book.The plot was inconsistent

 The leading lady appears to be incapable of making her own decisions

 The oracle tells her, and she obeys -- unless her husband asks her to do something, in which case she immediately does the opposite
 She treats her husband quite poorly -- gets married for mercenary reasons and seldom considers his feelings -- and then randomly acts in a affectionate manner


 The villagers' extreme hostility towards her and her magic just didn't make sense, particularly since they are constantly asking her for magical assistence.By the time she leaves home for good, the leading lady comes across as a selfish girl, who is incapable of respecting other people's customs

 The entirely plot up to that point was all "poor me", which I personally abhor
 Perhaps the last 3/4 of the book are better -- I cannot say.Anyway, if you decide to buy this book, good for you!  But don't build it up in your mind to be more than it is -- light entertainment, suitable to pass the time.

$review_text.: Set in Victorian England, The Mysterious Lady Law tells the story of Julia, a young dancer who returns home to find her beloved younger sister Georgina murdered.Stepping in to solve the case is Lady Law, an investigator who has trodden on the toes of the police by solving every case she has taken on.  When Lady Law says she will work for free, in spite of Inspector Slatham's reservations, Julia is only happy to agree.Sir Horace Holly, a renowned scientist, finds that his young assistant Rupert was one of Georgina's beaus, and he, too, has gone missing.  When he, Julia, and the inspector team up, they end up investigating a mystery that could solve the puzzle of who Lady Law actually is and how she solves her crimes so easily.This is a short novella where quite a lot happens.  It's a bit confusing at times, and there were some scenes that I could have done without which greatly took away from my enjoyment; however, up until those happened, I rather liked it.  For me, there was no need for the rather kinky sex scene depicted, and definitely not a need for the profanity that was used; it's Steampunk, not urban fantasy/paranormal. If I look past those, however, it was a decent, enjoyable read.QUOTE:"I find it best to set trends, not follow them."

$review_text.: The best part of the book is indeed its investigation of the inner recesses of the American Constitution, but there it does far too little. By the title and its promise "the divine and natural connection between the declaration and the constitution and what we risk by losing it" this work aims right at the heart of anyone who has recently studied the founding of our nation. However, not only is there no connection drawn, divine or otherwise, between the documents of which our government is formed, but fully half the book, which is small enough already, contains reprinted the Declaration of Independence, the Amendments to the Constitution (but not the Constitution) and a few of James Madison's Federalist Papers. The book would better serve if it had indeed also carried the Constitution. The subject matter alone warrants five times as many pages and I would gladly have read them if the writer would present something worthy of the topic.While I sympathize with what Arnn tries to do here, the book loses strength with over-simplification, broad brush strokes, and emotional grandiosity of the sort that may make a moving speech but when written in prose, simply makes the reader's eyes roll. "Franklin Roosevelt, one of the most important of our presidents..." Says who? Maybe one of the most memorable in recent history, but importance is in the eye of the beholder. The narrative is all over the place, rambling from Thomas Jefferson to Abraham Lincoln as if both were equally in league with drafting the Declaration of Independence.The expository writing style is full of tiresome word definitions. Sometimes truly interesting lines of prose come to a crashing halt with them. "The word nature has several meanings, two of which are most important here." Then he goes on to define nature and give drawn-out examples of the aspects of every definition of the word 'nature.' It makes the reading feel padded, as if not only did the writer add the Declaration of Independence but toss in everything Daniel Webster had to say about it, to try to fill a minimum word count. You should expect that anyone who reads your book owns a dictionary, has consulted it a few times, and is capable of the modicum of thought necessary to understand a phrase such as "law of nature." So much dictionary-ism is provided that is simply boring. Then we turn away from the dictionary, slipping into fluttery thoughts and mysticism: "If you think about it, our ability to talk comes from this ability to see the nature of things: reason and speech are the same faculty." No, they are not. I gritted my teeth through the rubbery logic of sentences that wish to sound intellectual but are not. "If particular things have a nature, and if things in general have a nature, one can see how one might think that there are rules in nature." One can see how one may think that this is ludicrous. "When we talk we have to use the common noun. There is a mystery hiding inside these nouns. It is very difficult to give an account of exactly how we use them. How do we know a cup is a cup when there are so many and they are so different?" There is no mystery in a noun. You might as well ask how a child in France may drink since he cannot ask for a cup but must instead ask for une tasse.Throughout the book just as some point seems to lead to another and there IS some good rationale, it is deflated with "we shall get to that" or "that is something we will soon see," which I find irritating. It's as if the writer is having a discussion with a group of teenagers and one of them just asked a great question but the lecturer's notes are all in order and he will not look ahead or let them have the answer because he keeps it secret, guarding it, to have a kind of psychological power. Don't toy with readers.The author places personal blame on Britain's King George III for tyranny that brought the American Colonies to revolt, when in fact it was not the king but his Councilors and Ministers more to blame. It was they who sought to forward England's goal of world domination. By Royal decree and brutal military practice, squeezing American colonists for money through taxes was a means to support wars and conquests around the globe. Little wonder the Constitution provides against illegal search and seizure and makes it always possible to assemble for peaceable discussion. George III was an un-likely monarch and did not or could not hold his house administrators in check. Little did they know that by filling prison ships with men and women tried, convicted, and transported for life, they populated the colonies with souls not at all inclined to bow to either law or force, and particularly disinclined to revere the British monarchy.All in all, I found this book such a disappointment. I asked for the thing from Vine. I looked forward to getting it. I was so hoping that the author's credentials meant sure wisdom and brilliant prose. I gave it two stars simply for the sincerity of feeling, but a meaningful, insightful work it is not. And do not make the mistake of labeling me with some political bent. I did not order, read, nor review this book for its politics, but for the skill or lack thereof, in presenting the information.

$REVIEW.: This book contains four stories, or episodes, each focusing on a different character. They live in the same area and each experience something that leads us to think they have "powers". We're giving a very brief glimpse at what is to come. The tag to these stories and what's to come is the reason I picked this up. Some may use their powers for good and others may decide to go evil? That's pure win for me.However, these first stories are incredibly short. If we're talking episode length, it felt like a fifteen minute blitz. Everything happened so fast that I felt a little let down. I wanted to stay in the world and watch the characters fleshed out.Of course, this is my first experience with a serial series like this so I may just need to get used to it and chomp at the bit for the next round with these 'Naturals.Each story is written by a different author and they each have their own flavor at coming to this neighborhood. But each story kept my attention and drew me in. Like I said, so much so that I felt let down when they were over so quickly.

$REVIEW.: Now in a new edition edited and with an introduction and annotation Jon Sweeny, The Road To Assisi: The Essential Biography of St


Francis was first published in French in 1894, as the first attempt at a modern biography of St

Francis, one of the most beloved figures of Christian history

Author Paul Sabatier struggled to answer the question: who was Francis the man? Groundbreaking research reveals the a fully human portrayal of a man who was nonetheless gentle, passionate, joyful, and who desired to live as Jesus once taught his disciples

An extraordinary work that covers Francis' weaknesses as surely as his strengths, enhanced by the annotation and sidebars that place events of Francis' life in historical context


Highly recommended for individual reading as well as biography shelves, and a must-have for library collections.

$review_text.: I earlier wrote a review of Lonely Planet's Guatemala where I reported indications the author had a conflict of interest. LP refused to answer any questions about this. The only thing they did was to prohibit my posting on their web site. Now the Daily Telegraph has published an article exposing further fraud. Kohnstamm, one of the authors of this guide said he never even went to Colombia. He said he wrote it in San Francisco with help from an intern at the Colombian embassy who he was dating. If Amazon wants to show any integrity in all this it should stop selling all known afflicted LP Guides until they can be vetted for accuracy by a reliable source. Obviously not an LP editor.

$review_text.: **Wish List by K.A

Mitchell**This is the first book by K.A Mitchell I've read and it's also the first M/M I've read

I have to say I'm looking forward to reading more of each


With that in mind, I will say the Dom/Sub aspect of the book was a little too much for me.Since M/M is a new area for me, I didn't know what to expect


After I got the guys right in my mind, it was an easy book to follow and understand
I loved the characters of Evan and Jonah, even if there were times when Jonah got on my nerves


I was completely blown away by how HOT this book was.The book overview does a really good job of summing the book up
Jonah accidentally comes across a box containing wedding rings and he automatically thinks Evan is getting ready to propose to him

I mean really, who wouldn't think that? Jonah and Evan have been together for two years
Me personally, two years and I need a ring and a lifetime commitment


I understand why Jonah freaked out


A lifetime is a really LONG time to be with someone and you want to make sure you're making the right decision

But instead of talking to Evan, Jonah decides to make a so-called bucket list of things he wants done in the bedroom, and of course he writes it on a piece of paper
Hey, nothing can go wrong with having something like that on a piece of paper now can it? Right.Evan is the guy everyone wants

He's not pushy or overbearing, he's patient
He constantly asks Jonah what he wants or what he needs, if everything is okay

Evan finds the paper Jonah wrote his list on
He wonders why Jonah just doesn't tell him what he needs to be fulfilled


Evan gives Jonah plenty of opportunities to tell him, Jonah just doesn't
I mean who isn't going to love a guy like that and want to spend eternity with them?I loved the way Evan guides Jonah towards fulfilling Jonah's dreams/fantasies and his own

The book boils down to the guys needing to trust each other and to being open and honest with each other.Rating: 4 (I really liked it.)**I Need You for Christmas by Leah Braemel**This was without a doubt my favorite book of the anthology
You can feel the love Ryan and Megan have for each other.Quick setup, Ryan and Megan met when Ryan's brother Derek started dating Megan's college roommate Amy

Ryan and Megan pretty much had their life together planned out until a horrible car accident changed their lives

Ryan's father and stepmother were killed in a car accident and Ryan at the age of twenty-two, was left to be the guardian of his two brothers and sister

Ryan knows what it's like to have your dreams taken away from you

He knows Megan's dream has been and is to be a Mountie, thus he can't ask her to give that up just to be with him.Now seven years later, he's finally ready and able to live his own life

Remarkably, all of this time, Ryan and Megan were able to keep their love for each other alive, even though they were far apart
Now this Christmas, they each plan on giving the other the best Christmas gift ever, themselves
No more lonely nights

No more a week here or there, when they have the time

How romantic is that? Did I mention neither one has told the other about their plans?I really loved both the main characters and most of their supporting cast

This was one of those books where I wasn't yelling at either the hero or the heroine to get their acts together

Well, maybe I was just a little bit.Did I mention that this book was HOT? I know I've said this already, but I really loved Ryan and Megan

I love the fact that they are each willing to give up their dream to be with the one person they love the most
What could be better than that?Rating: 4  (I really liked it.)**Breath on Embers by Anne Calhoun**This is the first book by Anne Calhoun I've read


Can I just say WOW? This book contains almost every erotic fantasy one could possibly want


You should definitely be prepared for a cold shower or two.Thea and Ronan are two very likeable characters


I fell for them both immediately

Thea is pretty much "dead" to the world because her husband was killed in a car accident shortly after Thanksgiving two years ago
Thea and her late husband Jesse loved the Christmas holidays
Christmas was a big thing for them and both of their large families

Ronan is a firefighter who has the classic "rescuer's syndrome"


He lost his uncle, who he was extremely close to, on 9/11 and his best friend, a fellow firefighter, three years ago during a building collapse.Thea's family, including her in-laws have absolutely no idea how hard the death of her husband has been for her
No one understands how hard it is for her to deal with Christmas and the holiday season while she has to watch them go on with their happy lives

They are constantly pushing for her to move back to the city where her hopes, dreams, and pretty much her whole world came to an end.Ronan knows Thea is using him to avoid dealing with her issues and problems
To a certain extent he is or was okay with that, but not any more


Now he wants more


He thinks they both deserve more.Thea and Ronan are two people who need each other
They met almost two years after Ronan lost his best friend and he is coming out of his own fog, ready to start living again

Thea made Ronan feel alive for the first time in years

She needs Ronan to teach her how to live and love again, without all of the darkness surrounding her.My favorite quote from the book isn't romantic or heated, but it's truthful
"The second year of grieving
It's harder than the first
Everyone remembers the first anniversary without a husband or the first Thanksgiving without a father


By the time the second one comes around, you're supposed to be over it
Everyone else is, but you're not
So it's harder


Lonelier."Oh silly me...I forgot about about the other man, not really


He's 6'5" how could you possibly forget him? Tim Cannon is Ronan's good friend and fellow rescuer

Yeah, he seems like a jerk at first, but he really isn't
It's all just an act he puts on

Unbeknownst to Thea, Tim helps to provide the start of the turning point in her life

Because of him, he realizes what Ronan means to her.I am definitely looking forward to reading more from Anne in the future.Rating: 4  (I really liked it.)Source: NetGalleyReviewed for Read Your Writes Book Reviews blog

$review_text.: Some children have the misfortune to be born to bad parents. Dani Brasher is one of those kids whose mothers use them as a punching bag and a target for her frustrations. In these situations, it often doesn't go well for the child. Such happens on a fateful night. Thanks to a well meaning neighbor the child is saved from her hell. Things get better for Dani for a bit as she is fostered out and adopted. Her adoptive parents are loving until tragedy strikes and the mother suffers an emotional break. With only a father and grandmother to support her Dani goes through a second hell in her teen years when a second kind of abuse takes place.This book has been written with the poignancy and pain of any child who has suffered sexual or physical abuse. The story is a sad account of collective experiences written as one character and the things she does to protect her soul from the bad things.  I felt a measure of sadness for the child as I read the book as well as anger for those committing the heinous atrocities. The story is not for the weak at heart but for anyone who seeks justice it is a good read about survival and taking control. I do recommend CATS EYE MARBLE and give it 5 stars. You will be educated and heartbroken at the same time and this book does contain mature subject matter.
$SUMMARY.: Hell is for children and this book proves.

Author did a brilliant job with character building and world building


I loved the setting, I loved the main character (fiery, plucky, strong, and not taking anyone's crap, not even her male lead's)

I actually would have preferred more development of the male lead, but he was still pretty good


I enjoyed the fact that although the main character was still wrestling with her horrific rape, that she rose above it


It didn't make her weak, like rape seems to do to most female characters out there.Good romance aspect, even better steampunk, and a surprisingly excellent plot (I don't normally associate "good plot" with the Romance genre, because really, we're all reading Romance for the sex scenes, if we're honest about it).Can't wait to read more by this writer

$REVIEW.: I have thoroughly enjoyed ever book by Tymber Dalton I've read. Love at First Bight is one of my favorites. I've reread it numerous times (and will again!). The bottom line is this is a an extremely well written book period. The characters are engaging, and fully developed. The setting is fleshed out so that you get a great sense of the environment without being bogged down in detail. The storyline moves steadily and smoothly making it very easy to read and hard to put down. The sex scenes are range from intensely erotic to sweet and tender. There's adventure, conflict, and troubled pasts to resolve. There's also a lovely little plot twist at the end that was surprising, and enjoyable (nice move on the author's part!).

He is a sobering realist and I think he realizes or accurately imagines what lies ahead but falls short of telling us.  He would probably be right but rather than sticking his neck out and taking the big leap he hedges just in case something happens that the human mind cannot imagine. What he portends might not actually be that bad and may be the only road to our salvation.  Incredibly gifted and am I am glad he is here at this place and time to impart his wisdom.

I have also read and reviewed both Highlander's Captive novella which is a prequel to the series and Highlander's Castle book one in the series. You can read in series order or as a stand alone books. I like to read all my books in series order, but that's a personal choice.The book starts actually in present day Isle of Islay, Scotland where orphaned twins Marie and Katherine MacLean recently lost their mother to cancer visit the ruins of Dunyvaig Castle which were their MacDonald ancestor's. Also Marie, heroine of this story and the eldest of the twins wears a four hundred amulet she inherited f'rom ancestor Mary MacClean MacDonald. The amulet had been passed down to her eldest daughter until it's once again came into the possession of a MacLean which was the twins's father's side. As these two feuding clans of the past should of come into peace once Mary MacLean married Chief Angus MacDonald as many feuding clan's did back then, yet the fighting continued. This also had been Marie and Katherine's Mum's past wish for the sister's to visit Dunyvaig Castle with the amulet but beyond that they had no idea.Katherine wanted an adventure so they entered the fairie circle and that is when things get fascinating in the book and a veil appears due to a wish from a handsome warrior of the past and pulls Marie into the past. I could feel the sizzling connection as soon as Marie set her eyes on her handsome highland warrior Archie MacDonald who insists she's one of the fae to come to help his clan. No matter how many times she explains to him she is from the future, all he wants to do is kill his enemy Chief Lachlan Maclean. Archie is acting chief as Angus their chief is imprisoned by the Kings order. The King too wants all this feudingBy the clans to end.If Archies kills Lachlan MacClean it will end the MacLean paternal line which would mean 21st century Katherine and Marie MacLean would no longer exist. Of course it is like banging your head against the wall. Besides that Marie is also worried about her sister who did not come on this journey with her but knew would be waiting for her at the fairy circle in present time. Marie's plate is full plus falling in love with Archie Campbell on top of everything else.For Archie he would like to keep his fairy forever but knows she longs to get back to her sister and knows his heart will broken once she leaves. He feels he must kill Lachlan MacClean for revenge and will not believe she has that strong a connection to Lachlan even though Marie keeps repeating she will dies if Lachlan dies! So will that be the end of the MacLean paternal line?  No more Katherine and Marie MacLean? You will have to read this adventurous, captivating and fun read and find out the outcome of this story.You will find some humorous parts too, like when Marie tries to explain 21st century birth control to a 16th century highlander was hilarious!I look forward to Ms. Wadsworth next book in the Highlander Heat Series &#34;Highlander's Charm&#34; which will be book three and is to be released in October 2014. I can't wait!~B

$REVIEW.: So I love books written for the UK reader. Love the &#34;s&#34; instead of &#34;z&#34;. Knickers. One being knackered....okay got that out of the way.Loved the growth of the characters. Sophie's strength & independence was always there, she just never chose to use it. One always knew that Lucien was a work in progress, but you understood that he had no idea how love felt or worked -- it had been stunted in his childhood, so he was basically an adolescent.Can't wait to read Knight & Day.

$review_text.: There are no conclusive medical benefits to circumcision and it's not a medical procedure

 It is a human rights abuse that destroys sexual pleasure.A better book to buy if you care about your child and wish him now harm, is 'Unspeakable Mutilations', which provides 50 real life accounts of men who are suffering due to being genitally mutilated

 Suffering which ranges from depression to anxiety to suicidal thoughts, psychologically, but physically, the inability to feel sexual pleasure and connect with their partners.MGM is more sexually damaging than the most common form of FGM
 It has the same history--it was brought to the West to 'cure' masturbation and control male sexuality

 As someone who has experienced being intact and being circumcised, I can say with authority that this barbaric act destroys all sexual enjoyment.

$REVIEW.: Re-reading the title, I see that I misunderstood what I'd be getting in this book
I thought it was more of an idea book giving you ideas for tweeting over 30 days
It's not


It's a tutorial about how to use Twitter.It is structured as daily tasks (called &#34;doables&#34;) that you do everyday to learn Twitter

Most of the tasks won't take more than 5 minutes, but that means if you're like me that you'll roar through most of them in one day

The quality of each task is hit or miss

Some are very well described while others have almost no information.For example, the doable on URL shorteners completely forgets to explain HOW to get to and use Bit.ly
There are also weird formatting features (dashes after some headlines, colons after others) and a few grammatical errors.But if you've never used Twitter before, and want to learn it slowly, you might like this book.

$review_text.: Author A.G. Riddle inaugural novel starts out pretty fast. Make that somewhat insanely fast. He throws things at the reader in rapid succession. But stick with it and pay attention. Comprehension will dawn. The characters begin to make sense and A.G. revisits everything. Every little plot twist gets attention. All the elements he packs into the beginning of the mystery will make sense. The grand scheme begins to make a little too much sense, making me wonder if there isn't some kind of Immari organization manipulating everything from international politics to economic markets. Hmmmm. Hero David Vale is a badass. But he's an unlucky badass, always getting thumped somehow. The baddies, especially Dorian Sloane, is intense and a remarkable opponent. He's smart and seemingly has the upper hand at every turn. Kate Warner isn't some wallflower either. She doesn't just scream when the going gets tough. It took me a week to read this, and I had to put it down occasionally because I just couldn't take the pace. And I love this type of novel. If you're looking for a thriller with a bit of sci-fi angle, this is definitely worth considering.

$review_text.: This book is so rediclous I just kept skimming, hoping to find something interesting.Our heroine, Anne, is firmly ensconced in the fourteenth, fifteenth or sixteenth century, I have no idea when, happily married (at about 20%), by handfasting, to our hero, Alex. Who doesn't seem concerned about the way she talks, just because she says she's traveled.I'm at 26% and they're having sex for the second time. Unfortunately, the first time was enough for me. They talked and talked and said the most inane things I've ever read. Almost everything said is just stupid and silly, no matter who she's talking to.I have no idea how this book got so many good reviews. The sex wasn't really &#34;trashy&#34; but it could have been much better. The first author who ever wrote that the heroine &#34;screamed&#34; out his name should be ashamed. Every other author had to jump on the band-wagon and use the same word. If you close your eyes and picture two people making love can you really picture her &#34;screaming&#34; out his name? I can't! And I don't read books without sex in them. But there is a limit to my imagination. I could never recommend this book. Sorry, Ms Wadsworth.

$REVIEW.: Secrets of the Moon by Kristy Centeno was a really great read. I have read a few books with werewolf's, but Secret's of the Moon had it's own edge and twist to the story. The story in general was great, but I felt that the pace of it was just everywhere. What do I mean by this? Well I was intrigued by the very first page of the book, but afterwards the pace slowed down. Then when all the mystery starts to be revealed the pace picks up again, and after reading a few more pages the pace slows down again. I felt that if the reading pace was consistent I would have rated it Secret's of the Moon a little higher.Kristy Centeno provides mystery, love, desire, anguish, death, and so much more in Secret's of the Moon. The mystery was one of the things that intrigued me to keep reading, but I hate to admit that the story was pretty predictable. There are a few things that I was unable to predict, hence the mystery and intrigue, but most of them I could pretty much guess on what was going to happen next. Kristy Centeno did leave a few unanswered questions about some of her character's, and the big mystery of who is the alpha male (I can kind of guess who it will be). Which only intrigues me to read her second book? I hope there is a second book, because Secret's of the Moon ended with a little cliff-hanger.All of the Kristy Centeno's characters are pretty well developed, but I will admit that Marjorie would get on my nerves. Marjorie is the main character and she has transformed from being a popular, selfish cheerleader into the shy and considerate girl. There are a few times that she gets on my nerves by her actions or just by the way she thinks. But Marjorie did grow on me by the end of the book :). What can I say about hottie Kyran Rousseau? Kyran Rousseau is mysterious, gloomy, bad boy material, he keeps the world out of his life, and he has a Jekyll and Hyde personality. Did I mention he is French? I don't know but I just have a weakness for the French accent and dialogue in general :). I can't really say much about the Rousseau's, because I will spoil the book for all of you.Of course there is the forbidden love between Kyran and Marjorie. What book doesn't have that kind of relationship? Kyran and Marjorie's relationship exists and doesn't exists, because Kyran doesn't really ask Marjorie to be his girlfriend. But the hot make-out sessions between these two is something you can't complain about. There are obstacles thrown their way to prevent them to fall in love with each other, and to keep them apart from each other. But this doesn't stop the pull and connection they feel towards each other.Overall, Secret's of the Moon by Kristy Centeno was a great and enjoyable read :D! If Kristy Centeno decided to write a second book, then I will definitely be reading it!~Kassie @ Kassie's Book Thoughts

$review_text.: This is the third book in Ann Littlewood's zoo mystery series and I certainly hope that more are on the way! I discovered this series recently and this past weekend sat down to try out the first bookNight Kill: A Zoo Mystery (Zoo Mysteries). Little did I know that I would be spending 3 days reading three awesome books in a row. I'm NOT an avid mystery fan but I AM greatly interested in critters and their social behavior. If you insert enough of this biological 'candy' in a book, I'm apt to give it a try.The series is set in the Portland, Oregon/Vancouver, Washington area, at Finley Memorial Zoo. The author does a great job of capturing the Pacific Northwest ambience. In this book, the main character, Iris Oakley, is sent off to a drug bust site with fellow zookeeper, Denny, to pick up 'exotic pets' to quarantine at the zoo until their post-trial dispensation is determined. Wild-caught South American parrots and a slew of rare endangered tortoises are discovered in addition to 2 captive bred macaws. Lots of convoluted events occur, putting Iris and her young son, Robby and Denny in danger. All in all, a fascinating read, even for someone who isn't really into mysteries.This series should be read in order since there is a progressive story line and character development. Read 'Night Kill' first, thenDid Not Survive: A Zoo Mystery (Zoo Mysteries)and thenEndangered: A Zoo Mystery (Zoo Mysteries). The author does a pretty good job of tracking details but a few discrepancies surfaced in the third book. Iris wore Calvin's coveralls during her pregnancy in the second book, but in the third book she said she had resorted to wearing Hap's. Also, in the second book her Honda was totaled by the stolen zoo van but she's still driving a Honda with a clouded leopard painted by her father on the back spare tire cover. Tiny details but still.....All in all, this is one of the best book series I've stumbled on recently and I'm desperately hoping for more! Even if you aren't a real mystery fan but love biology/animals there's plenty of juicy animal husbandry details related to zoo-keeping to keep you going. In this book there is a fascinating sub-plotline involving a newborn mandrill and the manipulation of mandrill social behavior to benefit the newborn and it's mamma. If you enjoy these books, look for the Gunn Zoo mysteries (The Anteater of Death: A Gunn Zoo Mystery (Gunn Zoo Series)andThe Koala of Death: A Gunn Zoo Mystery (Gunn Zoo Series)) as well.

$review_text.: 4.5/5I loved loved loved this book!! I love the world that the author has created. This is like no other angel book I have ever read. Action-packed and with a romance that will leave you breathless, this book is a must read!The angels have landed and they are everywhere. Since they made themselves know 100 years ago, their status on earth has rocketed up the social ladder and they are now the biggest celebrities around. The used to protect because they could, but all that's changed and now they charge people for their services. I loved the idea behind the angels and their greedy nature. If angels did actually exist and made themselves know I could totally see them being just as the author has described in the book. We live in money-hungry, fame-obsessed world so why wouldn't the angels want a part of this? It was a new and fresh change from all the angel lore that is out there.Maddy and Jackson I loved. I loved that Maddy wasn't obsessed with the angel craze as everyone else is. She seemed to be a fairly level-headed person, and knew what she wanted in live. She is completely unfazed by the whole thing and doesn't want anything to do with the angels. That is until Jackson steps into her life. Jackson I LOVED! He is the hottest angel around and so he is THE biggest celebrity out there. He has fame, fortune, and is used to getting what he wants and to people not saying no to him. But then he meets Maddy and he is left shaken by this stubborn girl. She intrigues him as she doesn't want anything to do with him and so he sets out to woo her. What he slowly comes to realize is is that not everyone falls for the glitz and glam. I loved seeing him grow and watch him learn that there is more to being an angel than the money. That angels were once better than that. Everything he has ever believed in is questioned. I loved the relationship between him and Maddy. It was a bit insta-love but not in an annoying way. It was very believable and I can't wait to see where it will go in book 2.The book is action packed. There is a serial killer on the loose who is cutting off angels wings and killing them. When we find out who the killer is I was like WHAT?!?! Get out!! I so did not see that coming! You are left guessing who it could be and then when we do it's such a shocker that you will be left wondering if you did actually read that. Props to the author for creating such a climax!Now the only reason I didn't give this 5 stars has to do with the narration. It is in 3rd person and is told mainly from Maddy's POV but we do get glimpses of Jacksons POV and then one or two others. Now that is all well and good, I felt that we got a better idea of what was going on and got to see the bigger picture. But sometimes during one persons POV we get little snippets of the other persons thoughts. This became a bit confusing at times and I didn't really like it.

$review_text.: "No Peace for the Damned" is a "supernatural romance" genre work by a first-time novelist who demonstrates a lot of talent. It's a story told in the first person, from the viewpoint of heroine Magnolia Kelch. She's had a tough childhood, to say the least, managing to escape from an abusive father and brothers, who put her through incredible torture and suffering.Fortunately Magnolia's supernatural powers enabled her to survive, and now she's assisting a secretive team that is fighting the Kelch family's crime network. Magnolia is at the center of their efforts.This story definitely works, and it stands out in a field that's becoming more crowded every day. It does so because the character of Magnolia is so outstandingly good. Despite some prose that at time is a little stiff, you can't help but sympathize and identify with her. It's a shame the characters surrounding her aren't as well drawn, and even more unfortunate that the romance at the center of the plot isn't very convincing. Still, the story can't help but draw you in, and unless I miss my bet, you'll be reading this novel cover to cover in non-stop fashion.Certainly there are going to be sequels, and I'm sure they'll be at least as good as this initial book. Author Megan Powell will certainly refine her craft as she goes forward.If you're a fan of supernatural romance, you'll want to read this book. If you're not a fan, this book might make you one. Either way, it's great entertainment.

$review_text.: In Broad Daylight is about an FBI agent who gets called back in to work on a case involving a serial killer operating in Alaska.  The story is quite interesting as it follows the agent's investigation and thinking.  In that regard I liked it very much.There were some flaws though.  The motivation behind the killer's murders was never really satisfactorily explained.  Nor was his fascination with and focus on the FBI agent.  Plus he sort of just gave into the agent's catching him.  Why?  I suppose one might say bad guys do bad things with no logical rationale behind their conduct.  However, we are given the idea that this particular character has some intelligence behind his deeds.  Anyway, I still enjoyed the book.

$REVIEW.: Heroes are not born, they are forged in the fires of apocalypse...In the heavens above, the three moons crash together, streaming fire and death in their wake; below, the seas rage as the roiling face of the world shatters. After Prince Varis Kilvar steals powers to transform himself into a god, chaos reigns from the king's city of Ammathor to the forbidding walls of the Black Keep. At his heels marches a demonic army torn from the very bowels of the Thousand Hells, and the risen God King uses terror to stake his claim over all lands.Betrayed and bound to Varis by powers he does not understand, mercenary Kian Valara is forced to masquerade as the world's savior, while a beautiful Sister of Najihar prepares him for his last battle. Victory against a living god is far from certain, but vengeance? For Kian, when the battle rage falls upon his soul and the sword hilt is hot and alive against his palm, vengeance is never out of reach.ReviewI really like the premise of this book. I love the idea of a person being able to transform themselves into a god and the two sides being drawn in this battle. The book is well written with beautiful language. For example, early in the book this description is given: "now its pitted surface was covered in vines, creepers, and witchmoss. Dampness and invading roots had crumbled its stones, giving it the look of an ancient, slumbering beast stricken with leprosy." I also found my favorite new curse, "You son of a poxy whore!" I love the rich language and descriptive passages.I really wanted to love this book for all the above reasons; however I had a hard time getting interested in the story as it dragged initially. At one point I was so bored I wasn't sure I wanted to continue reading. Despite loving words and enjoying the unique descriptions, I just wanted something to happen. I would have even been okay with killing people off to get the story moving. Finally after about half of the book, the story picked up.The last half of the book was much more active and held my attention. It was not engrossing like many books I have read, and my son stopped reading after the first two chapters. I would have called this a boy's book except for the fact that my son didn't enjoy it and he loves fantasy literature.I would be interested to read something else by James West to see if it was just this story that I had a hard time connecting with, or if it is his style of writing. I do think this story fits a nitch audience, it just wasn't my nitch.Overall I would give the book 3 of 5 clouds due to the rich language and the promising second half.

$REVIEW.: Not many people can say they enjoy their job, and Ben isn't one of them. But necessity has kicked in and he needed a job.  Working with Built4 paid the bills.  Trying to do the best at his job, didn't mean he had it easy.  Each of the steins that he had to transport caused him to hate himself a little more.Out of the entire stein's, he couldn't keep his eyes, or thoughts, away from Kee, the alpha.  There was something about him that kept drawing his attention towards him.  The only life that Kee knew was in the cage.  Being strong for the others, he would put on his brave face; even after his lover was taken from him.  There was something about Ben that kept his attention and had him watching.  Watching the "tee vee" allowed Kee to learn English, and when the time was right, he would show Ben what all he had learned.At first when it came to reading this book, I was apprehensive because it's the third book in the series and I haven't read any of the prior books.  I was really glad that I was able to follow the plot even with starting books into the series.The author made sure to put enough details in the story that made sure you had ample amount of background to understand what was going on.  I enjoyed the little things the author drew attention too, such as when Kee was learning to speak, and how it took several times for him to say the words before he had them correct.  I also liked the details she put into describing Ben and his feelings towards his job.  You could tell the anguish that he had for his actions.Overall I was pleased with the story, especially because it has a different set of character than what is the fashion now.  The author is able to bring in different readers who are just looking for something a little different.  I wish the author would have explained what the steins were for; all that was stated was for experiments.  But what kind?  Where they trying to cure a disease?  That question is still with me now.
$SUMMARY.: A Great Read!

$review_text.: As a person that lived in Europe for 4 years (Amsterdam) has many European colleagues and friends and has traveled extensively through all of Europe, I am always open to different perspectives on European culture.But this book is a load of nonsense. His whole opinion is that Europe is declining because 1) it is losing is belief in God and 2) it isn't following the American system of self determination and self reliance.For #1 he uses statistics that the percentage of people in European countries that go to church is in the 10-20% range and that 50% of Americans do without noting where he gets this from. Even a little research shows that Gallop did a poll, the result was that 41% of Americans SAY they got to church. A study of people actually going found that only 17% did. So even his premise is invalid.For #2, Europe doesn't WANT the American system. While they admire many things American does they don't want things like the GUN culture and the American health care system. Throw in the fact that Europe isn't a place, its many places. The Dutch are very different from the Italians,who are very different from the Croats, etc. These are all culturally distinct within themselves. They often function like big families with the whole group looking out for each person in the group. That's part of the reason why most European are comfortable with high taxes because they see it as the group looking out for them as individuals. This author hasn't a clue about any of this,I have to admit that I only read about 1/3 of the book scanning the rest because there wasn't anything to learn. It was starting to sound like something you would find in a Christian book store. If you told me Mick Huckabee wrote it, I would believe it.Europe has a lot of problems that are causing the current decline; an aging population, immigration especially from the Muslim world, labor issues etc. but the fact remains that Europeans have different values. Americans want a house and a nice car, but Italians want good food and nice clothes, the Dutch want to take extended vacations for example. These different views on the world are the issue here and how they are impacting the current decline. But you won't find any solutions in this book.

$REVIEW.: A teenage girl from a home improvised by drugs struggles with the burdens her situation imposes on her, and still keeping her dream of a better future alive. On the other hand her friend handles teen pregnancy and a `not so keen' boyfriend. It is the story of the challenges faced by the teens from improvised backgrounds.The novel depicts the emotions of the characters very well. It walks us through the hallways of their high schools and into the lives and relationships of the main characters. A read for young adults. In the end, things turned out well.

$REVIEW.: I am one of the readers who absolutely love the Wool series.  I have read a few of the off shoots from other authors, in relation to Wool, but this one in particular was the most interesting of those off shoots because of the extremes that the author has imagined to have taken place.  The silo is almost unrecognizable from the original concept of the creators.  It is interesting to see what happens to a society when it is completely cut off from the rest of the world, and only a handful of individuals control the information. (a la North Korea).

Beyond talking about what was going on here in the U.S., the author took a look at the military's desperate effort to get servicemen and women home in time for the holidays and what happened when that wasn't possible. (Many got back to the U.S. but not quite home.)A look at the first postwar Christmas in Europe is also included, as well as an examination of America's generous spirit. Somewhat oddly, there's also a chapter on Christmas 1945 in American jails.If you're really interested in reading about Christmas studies or World War 2, you would probably enjoy this book, too.

$review_text.: Awe - I can't believe it's over!! I want 3 more books of the Princess of Hell! LolThis was my favorite of the 3 books (and I determined that before the four-some :)There was so much humor in this, I can't even count my LOL moments

There were so many :) Between Lucifer, and Muriel's every day chaos going on in her head - lol I just love the way she thinks, and her mind gets off the subject and goes towards a totally different topic for no reason :)The book starts off where the last one left off - Muriel's mom (Gaia, aka - Mother Earth  interrupts dinner and announces that Muriel's pregnant - and of course, Muriel tries to kill her :)Muriel doesn't want to believe that her mother of all people was right, so she goes over to her father's Mage (Nefertiti) - the one that has been helping her with her nympho magic


Just before she gets there, a big group of demon's attack, and she uses up her magic to kill them.
but then another group of demons show up,and she has no choice but to turn tail and run.

but she runs right into .

of all things, a Vampire - and this vampire, as sexy as he is - is also scary, vampires are dangerous , but luckily for Muriel, he wants to protect her
Her empty magic had somehow called him to her


After he kicks Demon butt, he gives her a kiss, and although her moral side of her knows it's wrong, her magic doesn't want to let go of him..But just in time for David and Auric to pop in, she gets her head back in the game and off he goes...Roflol - back at Nefertiti's house, she has naked men all over her house and with Muriel walking in with Auric's hands over her eyes and David growling at everyone in their way - lol but they do run off to speak with a few of the men to get some pointers to help please Muriel a little differently
After all, when Muriel's magic is stronger, it makes their whole family stronger - awe -But she confirms the pregnancy and tells her that the daughter Muriel is carrying could destroy the world

She has so much power inside Muriel right now, even though she is only the size of her thumb.but this child is growing very fast and her pregnancy will be very short.So Muriel has a lot to think about - save the baby and kill the world, or kill the baby and save the world..

ha ya - right, no pressureSo now we're dealing with Muriel's pregnancy, her new Vampire admirer (whom David and Auric don't even know about yet) Her mother, and the evil master that was controlling Gabrielle in the last book -With all these things going on - it's no wonder why Muriel needs to re-charge her magic so often *yummy*Great story with lots of twists and turns and surprises , and the fun humor is just the added bonus :)Who knows, maybe we'll get lucky and Eve Langlais will write about "Lucifer's granddaughter" next :) Or maybe and his life with Mother Nature - the part he doesn't remember :)

It also includes more information than I had previously seen on some of Man O'War's competitors, and a wonderful sire-by-sire section at the end which traces Man O'War's lineage back to the Godolphin Arabian.  It has more detail than I could've imagined existed on some of these horses.  Highly recommended!

$review_text.: This is a very good, succinct, and accurate condensation of the Shakespeare authorship question, one of the longest-running fringe arguments in crank history. I was happy to see that Professor Wells takes on Richard Roe and Diana Price and that he doesn't give the arguments for the individual 'candidates' any more space than they deserve. Without becoming tedious, Professor Wells gives more than sufficient evidence for Shakespeare's authorship that anti-Stratfordians have never successfully rebutted.The distinctive characteristic of all anti-Stratfordian claims is that they are forced to invent labyrinthine, torturous scenarios to explain the most obvious objections to their assertions, i.e. both Marlowe and Oxford were dead long before half the plays were written. Their method is to peremptorily decide that William Shakespeare couldn't have written the works based on fallacious and (repeatedly) disproved reasoning, and then filling in the blanks they've created with whatever fiction takes their fancy. Not one scrap of evidence has ever been produced pointing to an author other than William Shakespeare, but anti-Stratfordians lack the intellectual honesty to look squarely at the evidence, instead positing a giant conspiracy (or not, depending on the exigencies of the moment) that covered up all the evidence for the true author.

$review_text.: Ashley Randell has a nice background
She has a lot on her plate when it comes to her career and working


As you can read Ashley is thinking about her decision when taking the personal assistant job as a writer for a man named Anthony Lang, so that she can jump start her writing career, but help a fellow man write his new book.This book reads in a nice fashion and it tells how she came to like Mr

Lang by describing what he looks like and how she felt about seeing him for the first time

Mr


Lang is actually a great writer, but he is blind, so this was the twist to the story that would have had you guessing

 Ashley has seen the intelligence, profession and funniness within this man

These are the key things that she seems to be attracted to.One thing that I have to say is that if you enjoy a nice little Romance between two people that are working together then you will love this book
How many of you have been in love or attracted to their boss or someone that they decided to help? This happens a lot and in this story you will read everything that Ashley Randell is feeling and then some


 Remember that when you are reading it try and think of your professional crush if you have one and see if the story played out the same or different than your life story

You might be amazed at how similar romance novels can appeal to the real life.

$review_text.: This story has strong and bad points.The story of Sam and Trevor is a cliched fairy tale set in New York city (where I grew up). I'll get straight to it. The author has great ability to describe Sam's asian relatives and acquaintances and why they drive her batty. Holy guacamole! It's just like how I grew up in Chinatown, arghh! If only the author and delved more into these characters and culture, this had the potential for an Amy Tan novel.  The city environment is accurate although a bit remote. I think the author has the talent to enhance that element and capture the spirit of the place in a Woody Allen-like approach.Holy cow, Sam and Trevor's personalities and interactions could come out of a Cliff Notes summary. One dimensional, graphic detail with no chemistry, empty dialog, elements of suspense introduced because they jump to unrealistic conclusions at the drop of a hat.I borrowed this book from Amazon Prime and I was so happy to return it. It's not worth the (free) memory on my account.

$REVIEW.: There are plenty of home decor books with perfectly perfect ideas offered on perfectly designed pages with perfectly polite instructions and quite frankly, I find them perfectly boring. If you want perfectly perfect, buy your decor at Pottery Barn. Creativity isn't about perfection. Creativity is about the willingness to roll up your sleeves and make glorious messes. TV Host and author Mark Montano gets that. How could you not love someone who fully embraces the beauty of imperfection and encourages you to design without a net? How could you not love someone who names his book The Big Ass Book of Home Decor? Mark Montano's fantabulous new book is a crafty revelation!This irreverent tome is simply bursting at the seams with fresh approaches to traditional techniques with a generous dollop of totally new concepts that will leave your brain spinning. Mark throws so much stuff at you on every page you're going to need a thermos of espresso, a sketch book and an oxygen canister at the ready. He fully exemplifies the mantra 'It ain't what you do, it's the way that you do it' and Mark does it with such flair and panache it's positively mind blowing. You may have decoupaged or texture painted or used plaster of Paris before, but I can guarantee you that you've never done it the way Mark does. If you love to dance on the edge of good taste, if you love a heaping helping of kitsch in your decor, if you are a frugalista who needs solutions to help you take your el cheapo finds and make them el fabuloso, this is your book.What impressed and intrigued me the most was the abundant array of aesthetics Mr. Montano explored on every page. Nothing was the same old, same old and everything had it's own unique design appeal. Whether you're a mid century maven, a shabby chic sophisticate, a Deco doyenne, a graffiti guru or a Belle Epoque believer...Mark gives you a plethora of fun techniques and concepts and shows you how you can tailor them to suit your personal sense of style. There are over 100 projects in this book to explore using affordable and easily accessible materials, which means there literally is something for everyone. If you can't find something to love here, might I suggest one of the aforementioned perfectly perfect home decor titles. Snore.Some of my personal favorite projects include: Garden Side Table, Mirrored Glass Candle Holders, Tramp Art Cardboard Frame, Silhouette Wall Treatment, Modern Office Flower Art, Circus Tables...and the list goes on and on and on. So many of these ideas make you smack your forehead and say, "Why didn't I think of that?!" For those of us who've grown weary of cookie cutter furniture with names like Flargensnorp and Gertlesnark, Mark works his design magic on those Ikea staples along with charmingly imperfect and dated flea market and thrift store finds. The projects are straightforward and easy to recreate, but rife with potential for further embellishment and personalization. You can take them as far as you like, mix and match ideas to make them your own. Mark makes even the entirely technically challenged feel empowered.I'm simply mad for Mark Montano and I'm quite sure after reading The Big Ass Book of Home Decor, you will be too. Perfect, schmerfect. Take a walk on the wild side, you'll be so very glad that you did.Margot PotterAuthor, Designer, TV PersonalityThe Impatient Beader Series, Beyond the Bead and Bead Chic

I mean &#8220;a true crime author and amateur detective, is obsessed with solving crimes near his home turf.&#8221; Where have I heard that before? The Hardy Boys? Nancy Drew? Come on!First, this is another &#8220;impossible to put down&#8221; novel from author Harry James Krebs. As with his earlier book, Fractured Persona, Mr. Krebs piles on the local color and nuances, weaving a very rich tapestry. Sometimes there&#8217;s too much detail, but that&#8217;s all part of the plan.Where this differs from more formulaic novels is that your mind is going in several directions at once. There&#8217;s never a shortage of suspects, and sometimes a plot twist takes you in a different direction, while other times not. The story is never predictable, and neither are the characters.And that&#8217;s my five star reason for liking this book; the characters. I did not like Ben Tucker initially; he seemed too flippant, kind of a jerk. But he grows on you; the author has cleverly revealed nuances of his character throughout the book so you continue to get to know him as the book goes on. Like John Sandford (Lucas Davenport), John Lescroart (Dismas Hardy), Michael Connelly (Harry Bosch), and others, Mr. Krebs has given us a character that we can grow more comfortable with over time; a flawed character that is more like the people in our lives and not just a name on a page.I&#8217;m looking forward to the next book in this series and will have to catch up on my sleep before I start it!

$review_text.: This book is great for those who like their science fiction to be fast-paced and action oriented.  There are fictional creatures such as zombies, ogers, shapeshifters and giant live rocks, but throughout the book you feel that this really COULD happen with the right conditions. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because there were a couple times I had to go back to re-read the introduction of a person or place. I couldn't read the whole book in one sitting (I have 2 toddlers at home) but when I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about what would come next. I was quite disappointed when the book was over. It totally left me wanting more! And the way the book ends leaves room for the belief that there might be a sequal.
$SUMMARY.: Awesome read!

$REVIEW.: &#34;The Houseguest&#34; was captivating enough to get me up early one morning, continue to drag me back to the screen throughout the day (at least whenever I could shake off those pesky responsibilities) and keep me up till after 4:00am, afraid to leave the narrative for a second more than was necessary.  So let me first praise the author for achieving something few authors seem to have mastered in the romance genre: the ability to write edge-of-your-seat suspense without throwing loads of high angst at the readership.When Lizzy meets Georgiana during that autumn when the Bingleys were at Netherfield, Mr. Darcy underestimated how firmly the two young ladies would bond.  All of his plots and plans that winter to escape the mere thought of Elizabeth are for naught, as Georgiana quickly has Lizzy installed as a houseguest in their London home before Darcy can blink.  It's quite amusing and sweet to watch Mr. Darcy fall in love against his will with an oblivious Lizzy, who is entirely focused on building a touching friendship with Georgiana.  Mr. Darcy's own observations disabuse him of some of his ill-founded misconceptions.  For example, it is very eye-opening for Mr. Darcy to see the response of both society as a whole, and his own relatives in particular, to Elizabeth as Georgiana's friend.  Throughout the tale, there are some shriek-out-loud bits of hilarity - parts of it due to Darcy's healthy competition for Elizabeth's friendship and, eventually, her heart.  The story is packed with activity, but the pacing is perfect, as it all flows together smoothly with a clear emphasis on each character's development and personal journey.One of my favorite aspects of Lizzy's visit with Georgiana is the time Elizabeth spends getting to know the Darcy siblings' extended family.  Ms. Adams does a great job of fleshing out minor, supporting characters from canon and bringing to life new OCs (Original Characters) entirely of her own creation.  I particularly love their complex, often-contradictory behavior,  such as when Lady Matlock happily tells about the love-match which her marriage was, even while she's trying to teach Lizzy how to judge prospective suitors by their wealth and prospects!
$SUMMARY.: You'll happily sacrifice days of your life to this book

$review_text.: The Beast of Boggy Creek by Lyle Blackburn documents the history of a Sasquatch-like creature that has been making appearances in the vicinity of Fouke, Arkansas for decades.  Also known as the Fouke Monster, it originally catapulted to fame when it became the subject of the 70s film The Legend of Boggy Creek.  Blackburn recognizes the movie, which he first saw as a youngster, as being a significant contributor to his eventual adult interest in cryptozoology.  Finding a dearth of solid documentation regarding the monster, the author took it upon himself to pursue the topic and become the beast's "biographer."A biography almost seems to be an appropriate summary for the book, too.  The author does not invest heavily into trying to prove nor disprove the reality of the creature.  He does include a summary of some common theories in one of the later chapters, and although it's made fairly clear that none of the suggested debunkings seem to hold much water, the work ultimately shies away from forcing an explanation.  The focus is clearly on recording the story for what it is;  who saw what, where, and when.  Colorful stories abound, and it's clear that Blackburn has put a lot of effort into getting around and unearthing every scrap of information he could.  Remote sites were visited, living witnesses were interviewed, and news reports were meticulously scavenged for details on the creature.  He even manages to tie nearly every scene from the Boggy Creek film to the real life event that inspired it.  And the end result is impressive to say the least.  Every mystery beast should be so lucky to have such a dedicated biographer.I really loved this book.  It reminded me of all the things I enjoy in a good old fortean mystery.  There are colorful characters aplenty, and a constant stream of the odd and intriguing incidents that you just can't help but want to believe.  The author manages to hit pretty much every aspect of the story, too.  From the history of the location and early sightings, to the infamous film and the resulting monster craze, and many of the locals who wound up at the core of the situation (right up to present day), there's rarely a dull moment.  The writing is clear and accessible and the pace keeps you turning the pages.  Blackburn really manages to express his own love of the mystery and the atmosphere surrounding it to the reader, and his enthusiasm is contagious.Highly recommended.  Existing knowledge of the Boggy Creek film is also by no means a requirement.  While I'm sure it adds some extra depth for those who have seen it, The Beast of Boggy Creek easily stands on its own merits.

$REVIEW.: Many people have assumed this book is a tirade against the Bush administration, a ranting and an epiphany.  It really isn't.  It's actually a rather tepid affair, and it doesn't really reveal anything we haven't already heard.Scott McCellan sounds more sad and disillusioned than anything.  In the beginning, he actually like George W. Bush and sincerely believed (quite naively) that Bush was going to end the partisan divide that engulfs Washington.  He really felt that Bush could bring the country together, and felt, at heart, he was a compassionate conservative.  Needless to say, Bush didn't govern from the center but from the hard right, and Bush became arguably the most partisan president in history.  Knowing about Rove's hardball tactics in Texas, it's kind of silly that McCellan would actually believe that Bush would bring people together.The book reveals that Bush lied about the war, that Bush isn't a particularly curious person, that there were no WMD's.  Well, most of us who have been following the news over the last number of years know this very well, so the book isn't this shocking expose.  Bush lied about the Iraq war, and it's a horrible thing, but at this stage of the game, it's not particularly revealing or shocking.As a book, it's an OK read. For those who expect a visceral tirade against the Bush adminstration, look elsewhere.  This one is still critical of Bush and Cheney, but McCellan is more disillusioned than angry here, and after all is said and done, it's a rather tepid book.
$SUMMARY.: Nothing particularly new, and not a visceral tirade against Bush as many people think...

$REVIEW.: Clayton and his demons and the darkness within him that followed him everywhere he went. Maggie is your not so typical high school teenager. Both Clay and Mags strongly believe that love and love alone will help them overcome it all. But unfortunately what darkness and demons Clay has within him can&#8217;t simply be cured by the love Maggie or others have for him. The issue that the author touches in this book and the fact that it wasn&#8217;t just an easy fix, made it feel somewhat real. An issue that so many turn a blind eye to or label it as &#8220;a trouble maker&#8221; or &#8220;junkie&#8221;. And in the process of Maggie trying to be Clayton&#8217;s light, it seems as she too has been dragged into the dark with him.

$review_text.: A complementary copy was provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.Chance Lost (Book 1) is a paranormal romance that centers around shape-shifters, Gods, and demigods. Jo offers an intriguing premise that demigods, immortals, and shape shifters walk the earth among mortals.  They eat, act, walk and talk like humans, but they certainly don't look like any typical humans. Throw in a god like Zeus or Lachesis (one of the Fates) and you have the formula for something extra special.Sylas is a demigod and immortal, one who was specifically created to keep the existence of immortals a secret and to stop them from  killing humans. To help him with this quest, he was given the ability to shift to any shape an immortal may take. He may appear as a dog or an eagle. To provide him company, Zeus and Lachesis also created his mate, one that is destined to be his partner and equal. The downside? He has been searching and waiting for her for the past 500 years, and he is getting quite anxious.Enter Chance. She of the long hair, the four level black belt skills and one messed up past.  She encounters a group of rogue shifters whose leader becomes obsessed with her after she embarrasses him in front of his pack.  Her life is in danger, and Sylas vows to protect her above all else from them. For who knows? She may just be his mate.I have read paranormal romances before but have veered away from the shape-shifter genre. I must say that I was impressed with this one. Jo LaRue has cleverly interspersed this story with human interactions, old magic and beliefs making this a more believable story.I loved the friendship between Sylas and Jack and their bond and protection of Chance, who is so fiercely independent that they are left in awe of her strength and her fortitude. She has, more than one occasion, proven that she is their equal and can take care of herself as well as they can.The pacing of the story is consistent, with strong characters and believable situations. One thing I thought was a little out of synch was that the story was set in current time, with references to green technology and living off the grid. The characters were drawn to be modern, Harley-riding, strong, rich individuals, yet the sentence structure of the conversations was formal.  I felt a bit of inconsistency there, but it certainly did not detract from the telling of the story.So if you are looking for a different type of romance with strong lead characters and the promise of good series, I encourage you to pick this book. It's well worth the read. I look forward book 2 to find out what's next for Sylas and Chance.

Even though Orrin has a sneaky suspicion that the Queen's intentions are not on the up and up, he still accepts the challenge because secretly he has made it his goal to find the sea witch for his own vengeance. Orrin and his brother, Kale, have been hunting pirates since their village was attacked and their mother and sisters were murdered by a particularly malicious band of pirates.Once Orrin discovers where Aeron is hiding he finds that she isn't anything like what pirates are suppose to be. For starters it seems she is saving people not destroying them. Once he finds out Aeron's secret and why the Queen wants her back, he vows to help Aeron and her crew to take Queen Winifred down.Lots of adventure loaded into this swash-buckling read. Aeron holds her own and is highly respected by her crew and village. Her attraction to Orrin has been ongoing since their first meeting many years before so when the meet up again they are able to capitalize on their magnetism. Orrin's brother even finds a surprise on the island for himself. Queen Winifred's character is one nasty witch who abuses girls. Definitely for the adult readers of historical romance.

$REVIEW.: In 1996, Emma's Dad gets her a computer to make up for the fact that he's living his new life, with his new wife and his new baby daughter. Emma's friend, Josh, brings over a cd disc that includes a version of AOL, a way to investigate the new frontier--the Internet.My Thoughts:Yes, at one point people paid by the minute/hour for internet service. We took those Earthlink and Juno and AOL discs and made the best use of them. Most of the time, the service guided you to the news and relevant information--there was no Google.Emma finds a link in her email to something called `Facebook' and learns it is a mirror into her future, and into Josh's future...and everything suddenly changes.Little things the teens do impack the future selves they see on Facebook. Josh and Emma make deals with one another, rules of how things should be and the ways they need to interact with people now to save their future.I was Josh's age in 1996, and I remember the excitement I felt when logging onto the X-Files chat room. Then the mortification when my Mom sat behind me and told me that I didn't have all night and there were `weirdos' on the Internet.One thing that kept popping up in my mind is the differences between now and then--yes, I grew up in a small town and I remember things spouting like wildfire--but looking at Facebook now, I see the inane things we post on the social networking site and I cringe. I also think that things spread on Facebook go faster than a small town.I was pleasantly surprised by this book, at multiple times I saw reviews of this on the blogosphere and dismissed it because of the cover. Once I read the concept, I decided I HAD to read it.Loved the old school feel and terminology, and loved that I could relate to the book. This is probably one of my favorite reads of the year.

$REVIEW.: This series snagged me with Carved in Stone and I have gobbled up every book since. I love the dynamic of Will, Jessica and Ellen despite Ellen and Will being each other's ex's. It just makes for a lot of crazy humorous scenes throughout the series but especially in Commissioned in White where you finally get to see Will and Jessica get married. Mind you,the wedding was planned by Ellen, the dress was chosen by Ellen and Ellen might have recommended the bride get a mild sedative from her doctor for the extreme wedding jitters she was experiencing! Wedding planner Ellen also plans the wedding for her son Shane and his wife Reesa after Shane finds out Reesa had a wedding dress hidden away that she had been holding onto for 10 years. Insanity reigns throughout but stoic Reesa prevails...after all, she expected it. You will laugh while you are reading this book and you will find yourself purchasing the rest of the series as fast as possible if you haven't already read it. If you are like me; this series introduced me to Donna McDonald and had me purchasing everything she has written and yes, I have read it all!

I figured I was in for a Nora Roberts-type romance.I was completely wrong.And I couldn't be happier.I loved this book.  Mabie's writing varies from witty to sweet to sarcastic at appropriate times throughout the novel (but be warned, if swearing isn't your thing, walk away now).  The book didn't earn a full 5 stars from me because the prologue was a little overwhelming, and I thought the plot twist was blatantly telegraphed throughout the story.  However, Mabie's ability to put her character's complex feelings on a serious topic into a humorous story has made me a huge fan.  Definitely an excellent read.
$SUMMARY.: 4.75 STARS!

$review_text.: The premise of this book intrigued me.  I believed that the keynotes of redemption, forgiveness, and second chances would make a good read.  The author has a good story line and as such, I enjoyed what I have read so far of the book.  My problem comes from having to overlook the extraneous words, incomplete sentences, words omitted, and duplications both before and after the thought.  In short, the worst job of editing I have ever encountered even from my high-school sons.  The errors are on virtually every page and I am only at 44%.  I can't believe this was published in such an incomplete state.  Previews I have read are very, very generous and forgiving.  I considered, after the first few pages, making a list of errors and submitting them, but they are so numerous it would have taken all pleasure from the read.  I hope someone takes the time to properly edit and resubmit this work. It would change my rating drastically.

I like how she fought for consumer rights and to help people struggling but I didn't agree that how she handled them were long term but it seemed like she didn't understand the long term chess game of economics. Her compassion and background make her a good person with good intentions and the world needs that. I like the strategic long term thinking that helps people elevate instead of temporary relief that may disappear in four years. She tried though and that makes her have good character in my opinion.

$REVIEW.: Texas Jack's Famous Sweet Potato Recipes is the third book in the Texas Jack's brand of the bestselling series of recipe books.Texas Jack's Famous Caramels Secret Recipe BookandTexas Jack's Famous Pralines Secret Recipe Bookhave been selling like hot cakes; this book holds the same promise.This book is all about the sweet potato. We have all seen it in stores--it's that weird-looking thing that looks like an overgrown orange-ish potato with a little sting on one end. Yet, very few of us know what to do with this curiosity, at least here on the West Coast.By the looks of it, Texans have tamed this tuberous root, and are making enough dishes out of it to serve a wedding. This book has recipes for sweet potato pies, casseroles, cupcakes, cornbreads, biscuits, and mashed and hashed sweet potatoes; in other words, you name it, it probably has it.All the recipes are simple to follow and the preparation process is detailed, including the guide on how to select potatoes while you buy them and how to prep them for cooking. My favorite recipe in this book is the Southern Style Hash Brown Sweet Potatoes; and yes, it is the simplest. I am a guy, whatever.One important thing to note here is that the sweet potato is one of those so-called "super-foods" that are really good for your health. It has just about the highest level of beta-carotene, that is a precursor to vitamin A, a very important vitamin that many of us lack. Sweet potato also has a very special protein called "sporamin" that prevents oxidative damage to our cells. Basically, what I am getting at, is that sweet potatoes are good for us. Just make sure you add a little bit of fat (oil or butter) to it when you are cooking or serving it, just like in these recipes; it will help with the absorption of all this good stuff.As usual, a great Texas Jack's brand recipe book. Recommended.

$review_text.: Who is the young girl whose body is found floating in the bay? Why have the Flannigan family returned to the neighbourhood? And why is 16-year-old Aileen's mother so determined to stop Aileen from learning to swim?YA fantasy is not my normal reading material for so many reasons. For a start it was way back in the last millennium that I could last honestly call myself a YA. But it's fun to read something a bit different sometimes, especially when it's as enjoyable as this book.Aileen has always been drawn to the sea but after a childhood accident when she was nearly lost, her mother has been dead against her swimming or even going on a boat. Since they live on the shore, this is a pretty big deprivation for Aileen and she's finding it hard to obey her mother's strict rules. But when she sneaks off to a party on a yacht, she is horrified when they find the body of a young girl floating in the bay. Suspicion falls on several people in the small town, not least on Aileen's own family and the families of both her ex-boyfriend, Ian, and her new one, Jamie. And Aileen is soon to learn a secret that her mother has kept from her all these years - a secret that finally explains her fascination with the ocean and the seals that live closeby...Drown writes very well and Aileen is a believable, likeable sixteen-year-old, dealing with the normal things like school and family but also having to face up to the fact that she's very different from her friends. With the arrival of the mysterious Jamie, Aileen is thrown into all the turmoil of first love and I thought Drown handled the romance aspect very well. Although this is a fairly light read with a lot of fun elements, it also has some dark episodes and on the whole this contrast worked well, although there was one incident which I felt was so dark that it was slightly out of tune with the rest of the novel. Overall, I found this an entertaining, light read, well written, with good characterisation and a nice blend of reality and fantasy. Recommended.NB This book was provided for review by the publisher.

$review_text.: Read Liaquat Ahamed, Yves Smith for Great Depression analysis (Ahmet) and current disaster (Smith)

Read Minsky and Skidelsky for a clearer understanding of what Keynes himself thought (General Theory, which I've read twice in 3 decades, is a little murky) and for a clearer understanding of the limits of governmental intervention and, perhaps, size.This book takes all of an hour to read, which should tell you how complete the exposition of ideas is or isn't

This would make a decent outline for a two or three volume work that actually examined the ideas Roubini glossed over

Worse, Roubini seems not to understand aspects of Keynes and clearly doesn't have a good grasp, at least not that was put to paper, of the driving forces, at least in the particular, behind the banking crisis of 2006 - 2009

The abuses of the Central Limit Theorem engaged in by both the banking and trading communities are not even alluded to, yet they are the why's of LTCM and AIG collapses.

$review_text.: I am so emotionally invested in these characters, it's not even funny. H.M. Ward knows how to write a suspenseful story and how to play with her readers' emotions. Avery's life is filled with conflict, on ALL levels, and all I want to do at this point is give her that much needed hug (and shake her by the shoulders a bit). Every which way, she is torn & must make life altering decisions yet there doesn't seem to be a clear path towards her well deserved "Happy Ever After". What started out as a love story is now a complexe mystery, where anyone can be hiding behind lies and deceit. Sean SEEMS to have put all his cards on the table and now the next move is Avery's... what will she do? It's a Sean Ferro Revelationfest! I hope there is some happiness coming Avery and Sean's way soon; I don't know how much more my poor heart can take.I do have the satisfaction to say "I knew it!" when something is revealed that I suspected since very early on (which is extremely rare since H.M. Ward is so unpredictable!).Technical stuff: It took me 2 hours to read this volume.

She's so dizzy in an intelligent sort of way. She had me cringing from the start.Steven or Sir, was also a likable character, although there wasn't much to his character. There was very little history to him but the same can be said for Karen.The book is well written and it's lovely to read the love blooming between Sir and Kitten.The story came to a natural end but has left me waiting for the next in the series.The plot is well thought out; it could have been extended on in places but it doesn't feel like it's missing anything.The sex scenes are HOT but don't take over the story.All in all I enjoyed the book

$review_text.: My Review:If you plan to read these books, there are huge spoilers here for Triple Dare, the book that precedes this one. In that book, Rob came clean with his best friend Joe that he had a terminal, inoperable form of brain cancer. This book takes place ten months after that book. He has spent the last 8 months in Italy under the care of Emily, an alternative medical oncologist and now he is in remission. As a result, he has flown to Australia to be in Joe & Anna's wedding, against his doctors advice.Emily has been fighting her attraction to Rob for months. As his doctor, she can't get involved, but the night that she declares him in remission and takes herself off his case as his doctor, they share a single, mind-blowing, scorching kiss. As she chases him to Australia to make sure that he doesn't overdo, she continually asks herself just what exactly she is doing. She knows that she is lying to herself as to her reasons for going.Rob, on the other hand, is lying to himself about very different things, such as the fact that his life has been forever altered by the fact that he has had brain cancer. Despite an incredible attraction to Emily, he is fighting his own demons about her as his doctor. He wants to live life to the fullest without the threat of cancer hanging continually over his head.As you can see, this is a book dealing with some incredibly tough emotional issues. But in the midst of all that is a scorching hot book, full of sexual tension and angst. I really liked the way that Lexxie intertwined the themes so brilliantly within this book. It makes for a really full and satisfying read within what is really just a novella. It's incredibly done.

$REVIEW.: Kent Hill's latest contribution to bizarro fiction, namely "Deathmaster: Adventures in the 39th Uncharted Dimension," targets two of my least favorite genres, specifically quest fantasy and space-based sci-fi. But that's okay with me.Because, like I mentioned, Mr. Hill actually targets these genres. He targets them through parody and satire, much like Mel Brooks and Seth MacFarlane tried to do with Star Wars via "Space Balls" and "Blue Harvest," unrespectively. But where Brooks and MacFarlane fell on their disrespective faces, Mr. Hill triumphs with a satire that is actually funny.Regardless of how you may feel about quest-type fantasies or space odysseys, I was immediately drawn into this strange tale when I read the following passage in the so-called Pre-Credit Sequence: "The story I like best though, is the one when (Dad) was first recruited by this alien race. Ironically, this coincided with the day he decapitated my mother.""Deathmaster: Adventures in the 39th Uncharted Dimension" is the story of a sex-obsessed young man trying fill his estranged father's misogynist shoes. We're introduced to the main character as he hits on a sexy co-worker at the gym, setting up a date with her at his apartment later that evening, but then spending the afternoon getting lap dances at a local strip club.When his date eventually arrives at his apartment and he starts to make his move on her while they lounge upon the living room couch, suddenly he's struck with a case of couchus interruptus and he is whisked off to another dimension where the women aren't so quick to jump in the sofa.His manhood, which he had limited control over in the non-fantasy world, is suddenly transformed into a metaphor representing his father's sword. There is, of course, a beautiful heroine in the fantasy dimension, but she won't let our hero get past first base until he proves himself a true "swordsman."Unfortunately, the metaphorical sword is useless to him in this 39th Dimension, until he faces the very vices causing his impotence, namely drunkenness (Z'Dar), domestic violence (Zombie Ninja) and bad hygiene (Furgarde). As he confronts his myriad of vices, he is awarded power gems to adorn his inherited sword, and thus attains more control over its use. Eventually, he must face his own misogyny (Overlord) in order to win over the heroine Chandra.But then again, maybe I'm reading too much into this... Consequently, allow me just to recommend this novella by Kent Hill based on its humor, creativity and enough 1980's pop culture references to fill a season full of Jeopardy episodes.

$REVIEW.: I agree with on of the other reviewers that the Genki textbook just does not have enough examples or in-depth / creative discussions of grammar


So when you then go to the workbook, it's kind of a baptism by fire into putting the rather anemic lessons to some use.Another issue is that you will need the answer key to this workbook if you self-study

That is also around $20

Unfortunately, all of the answers are written in that book exclusively in kanji, which of course is not taught until the very end of the first textbook
So, when "grading" your exercises it will be a constant flipping between not only the workbook and the answer key, but the relevant textbook page itself
Which is all the more frustrating because there is minimal benefit to kanj-correction if one has not specifically been including this in the curriculum.Another 20% of this workbook will not be of use to you unless you purchase the multi-CD listening comprehension set which is around $225! I'd opt for the less expensive 2-disc set that sources the textbook (and not this workbook) exclusively.Lastly, I also have to laugh at one of the other reviewers who credits her "perfect" Japanese with the Genki series


Nothing could be further from the truth; one does not even begin to understand the myriad of honorifics of the language, not to mention how to speak in anything other than what might be considered ELEMENTARY, textbook Japanese

Hence, the title.

$REVIEW.: SEAL SERIES 1During the start of the month, I was on a bit of a SEAL reading kick
 Guess I just felt it was my patriotic duty to read about these brave men & women
 (That's my story & I'm sticking to it.)  I happened to pick up Sharon Hamilton's "SEAL Brotherhood" Boxed 1 Set, which contains "Accidental SEAL" and "SEAL Encounter"."Accidental SEAL" didn't really do much for me


 It's basically a prequel to "SEAL Encounter", and could have just as easily been a prologue in "SEAL Encounter"
 It's one of those "so close but yet so far" type stories where you are introduced to a pair of characters that have a spark but just never quite manage to connect

 That's what happened to Kyle & Christy; but meet they do in "SEAL Encounter"!Christy is new to town; she's inherited her Mom's condo & decides to hang out in town for a while


 Since she has a realtor license, she makes use of her time by hooking up with a local office
 She's sent by another agent to do an Open House; problem is that she is sent to the WRONG house


 That house, of course, is where Kyle is hanging out looking for his out-of-communication SEAL buddy, and when he hears someone coming in he suspects ill intent
 Before you can yell "Yehaw!" Kyle has Christy hog-tied..

and there's the "encounter".From this point, the book becomes a romantic suspense - Kyle & Christy are battling the bad guys, while trying to find his SEAL buddy and saving the day

 Overall, a great read & it really pulls you into the story


 There are times it drags a bit..

just skim past until you get to a point where the action has picked up
 It's cool to read about the interactions between the SEAL team & how they really are a community into themselves.

$REVIEW.: I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. "Friends are like diamonds"... With this premise, Author Yael Aharoni introduces us to Daniel, the Irascible. The reader's expectation is clearly set for a story which will focus on the value of friendship, something which has a significant moral. The author delivers, above and beyond my expectations. Here's why I was not disappointed:To begin, the pictures are so cute and imaginative for young ones. Again, it must be stressed that pictures are very important. It's hard to keep 4-6 year olds captivated, but this book does.  It is made easy and fun with  color, and an adorable main character who is simply tremendously likable. Most importantly, this children's book offers toddlers a perspective that they may not have considered: choces. Children have choices with regards to their health.I think that is such an important message and it comes definitely at the right age. It's a sweet book to snuggle up to with your children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews, anytime. Truly, this is a book to enjoy!Reviewed by Thomas Jerome BakerAuthor ofPublic Speaking: What Amazing Nonsense You Are Talking!

Sophie is strong and spunky and dealing with her own troubled past

Both characters make their journey in authentic ways, sometimes imperfect, sometimes misguided, which makes them that much more real and three-dimensional


If you're a fan of contemporary romance, especially with younger characters, this book is a can't-miss.

$review_text.: "What is the purpose of intelligence but to serve others?" says main character Renee at one point, an interesting credo she does not herself follow. The autodidact concierge keeps her talents hidden on purpose, due to her class origins and an event we eventually discover. She goes through life accomplishing little, while making her smug and superior comments about the elites. Some of those observations are insightful and often entertaining, and others miss their mark, although one can easily understand the wide range of reviewer comments from passionate pleasure to passionate disgust. To me, she should have distinguished more between the elite slackers and those who at least were trying, as with the authors and filmmakers she adored, and Mr. Ozu, whose arrival triggers the narrative drive that brings needed energy to the novel.Young Paloma, contemplating suicide, also offers keen commentary, yet here the author was a bit over the top of believability. There's a limit to how far you can push a precocious 12-year-old's conclusions about the futility of life and other mature concepts, interesting as they may be.The ideal Mr. Ozu arrives as a new tenant and quickly discovers that Renee and Paloma are not what they seem, with slight references to Anna Karenina among the triggers. Renee worries that her cover has been blown by the observant Mr. Ozu, whereas Paloma welcomes the fresh air. The unfolding of the new relationships, especially that of Mr. Ozu and Renee, forms the key stretch of the book.As far as the ending, well, I don't know, waffling between considering it a dud and effective.My advice to readers or listeners who find the first sections annoying and pretentious: keep going a bit longer until one of the minor characters dies and the (modest) action begins. If you really can't stand the idea of philosophical musing about class, knowledge, society, and such by a kid and a concierge, then bailing out might be the proper move. Even with Mr. Ozu around, we get sidebars on this and that.Narrators Barbara Rosenblat (Renee) and Cassandra Wilson (Paloma) deserve their noticeable praise. Renee sounds American, except when pronouncing French words and phrases with precision, and the combination flow naturally.

At first, I thought OMG, this story is ridiculous
This is not even remotely realistic


As time progressed, I could understand why Jack wanted these types of relationships

To protect his himself from gold diggers


He didn't think this thing through though


The first thing I thought when he said they would not share names was what if they ran into someone who knew him, wouldn't they say his name.I liked Laurie, she seemed like a real person

She agreed to this strange arrangement, and I knew that she would fall in love with this guy


Hell, I did

I also knew that his feelings for her were very strong from the beginning because of the way he thought of her


And from the way he felt about Ben.I absolutely do not like reading books that are in a series until all of the books have been written because I do not like waiting for the next book


I didn't realize this book was part of a series


If I had known, I wouldn't have read it yet

The cliff hanger is too much
The author says the next book will be out in May, but it is my experience that author's aren't that good at predicting when the next book will be out


They are artists after all.

I especially enjoy his friend Tacitus, who is my favorite Historian of the period

These give an excellent picture of life and Rome and the historical detail are spot on


You really get the feel of life of an upper class Roman in these stories.I found myself gripped by the mystery which I found very exciting

The story moves along and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes mysteries set in Ancient Rome
They are much better thatn Gordianus the Finder which I find a bit on the boring side and not as historically well done as these.If you like Roman historical mysteries you will not be able to put this one down
I recommend that you read all by this author.

$review_text.: Just finished re-reading this book. Honestly wasn't looking forward to reading it again, except for the part about the Council of Nikea which had piqued my interest the first time around.Mostly skim-read through the first half of the book, wasn't really paying attention. A lot of not terribly awesomely written combat descriptions and all that. Logical loopholes like the titular sorcerer-marines not being able to control their emotions while supposedly in full control of their mental selves in the "Enumerations". Needless over-focusing of verbally differentiating the fighting styles of different Legions, a very common flaw in WH40K writings, i.e. "The Space Wolves fought like the savage berserking raiders they were, slaying two to the left and one to the right" etc etc. That's not a verbatim quote, but indicative of a problem in many Horus Heresy books.Some typos and mistakes by the proof-reader, but not half as bad as whomever proof-read the Eisenhorn Omnibus. Speaking of which, look at the battle descriptions in there, and then look back at this. Dan Abnett is clearly superior there, though that's not necessarily so obvious in his lesser-quality Gaunt's Ghosts series.Graham McNeill gained my respect suddenly toward the end, when the writing became rather terribly good. Nice work, with a lot of stuff. The last quarter of the book was rather riveting, something I definitely wasn't expecting based on having read the book before and the previous half or so.All in all, not bad. Crappy title, though, but I suppose we couldn't have "The Wolves Are Coming" or "In Defense of Knowledge" or some such. At least there's more evocative titles like "The First Heretic" and "Prospero Burns" to look forward to. For a minute I thought the title of the latter masterpiece was "Prospero's Lament" but turns out I was wrong. Google it for some interesting etymology on various 40K main terminology.

I commend the author for writing such a comprehensive and easy to understand book on this topic


The author lays out all the main sections that need to be included in a powerful business plan and teaches exactly what to write in each section, so that your plan is compelling and detailed.As a niche business owner myself, I found the sections on how to do niche marketing the right way extremely valuable

And the section on how to create balance sheets and profit and loss statements was the best I've ever read.The author himself is an expert at business planning and shares wisdom and knowledge he has used in his own business plans

I highly recommend this book.

this book is very erotic, with non standard sexual situations and groupings

 It was a bit over the top for me, I didn't expect to find erotica in this type of fantasy, but I liked the rest of the book well enough to deal with the sometimes graphic sex


 I prefer werewolf fantasy to vampire fantasy; this book blended it all together with a decent police mystery....

$REVIEW.: What a satisfying novella! So often, stories like these can fill like pure filler, but I really enjoyed this afternoon spent with Cady, Lon, Juke, and Kar Yee.It takes place just a couple of weeks after Summoning the Night

Lon and Cady have decided to take Juke out on a boat to test his new knack of persuasion
 Kar Yee agrees to be his guinea pig


 The captain is hiding something big
 Juke makes a pretty substantial mistake


 Throw in a major storm and a lightning strike and this group is facing an uphill battle to make it home alive.There are not a lot of big overall series storyline developments or relationship changes


 It&#8217;s just a great snapshot in the life of this growing family


And it&#8217;s an opportunity to showcase Jupe, who is so wonderfully imperfect yet entirely loveable.Be warned, it is short! And about 1/3 of my copy was an excerpt of Kindling the Moon & promo stuff, so don&#8217;t be disappointed or surprised when it&#8217;s over
You don&#8217;t have to read this one to follow with the series, but I can&#8217;t imagine that fans would want to skip.

Book one introduces the characters and drops pieces of the puzzle to tantalise the reader, book two delves deeper and although it is descriptive in the gore and horror, it was no surprise for this kind of story and fitted in well.The mystery deepens and keeps the reader on their toes - the lies...who is who, who is right, who is telling the truth, what is the truth...? - just brilliant.  The tale twists and turns back and forth and is superbly written (despite the typos, which are a fact of life).  I liked the characters who suited the story perfectly and look forward to the next book - oh, what a clever ploy.Highly recommended - a great plot, full of mystery, suspense and perfect as a true horror story.

There was a bit of history, some personal issues each one worked through, some sheer endurance issues and more.I liked the set up, in which Eli and Colin each wrote passages from their own perspective.  I would definitely recommend this book, I was a little sorry when it ended.
$SUMMARY.: I walked with them!

$REVIEW.: First sorry it took so long to finally read this book. May contain spoilers. This book was amazing so many twist and turns felt like my brain was being pulled in many different directions and totally did not anticipate or figure out it would end like that. I knew they was something fishy going on in the second America, but not that it was a pentimento itself. I knew the beast were real, but could not figure out until the end their purpose on Earth were they evil monsters or not and why do they choose to have no real contact with humans, beside taking a girl whenever they want. Why hide in the shadows of a world filled with them why not just try to open everyone's eyes at once? The irony that even though Iris was the most resistant and wanting to find the truth was blinded the most and could not see it except for seeing how her friend Zoe really looked. And what about Colton he lost technical three girls he dated will he get to be with Iris will Prince Andre allow that since he wants her for himself. Did the masters/beast even care that the girls they took had boyfriend that they loved since the prince told Zoe they did plan to take males in the future. And of the ones before Zoe and Iris were not really brides what were they to the beast how were they treated differently. So I hope that you do write another book I need to know what happened I guess you say I don't like books being left open I like it to end wrapped up in a neat little bow.

$REVIEW.: Complimentary copy provided by author/publisher for an honest reviewI have been reading along with Julia Mills Dragon Guard Series and, I swear, each on keeps getting better and better! Her writing continues to amaze me and I just love all her men *wink*Haunted by Her Dragon is Lance's story. I think we all have a little love/hate relationship with Lance. He is such a pain in the *ss but a cute one you can't help but want to playfully banter with. We all have one of those guys who are just a natural flirt, cocky grin and loves to give you that panty melting wink! Well that is Lance and he has finally met his mate; Samantha 'Sam&#34; Malone.Sam is loveable and a bit odd. She is so guarded from her past that it seems like her wall is up for most of the book. I wanted to reach in and tell her she deserved to be happy and to let go!! I mean come on, you got a hot guy who wants to make you scream his name and put your needs first...yes by all means fight your feelings and not let him in; NO! I do understand why she was protective of her heart though and I can't fault her for that, but I can be frustrated.What stuck out in this book from the others was that we got a look into the day to day life of the clan. Before it seemed they were out of their elements and away from &#34;home&#34; while trying to handle the situation. But in this book we actually get to see a lot of the clan members and get a better sense of their family which I LOVED! It made me fall in love with the clan and feel like part of it!There was also a twist of the little girl Sydney in this book! I loved that there were children, as sometimes they are absent in a lot of romance books which makes &#34;sexy time&#34; harder as anyone with kids know. Sydney is too cute and like Sam, Lance and the rest of the clan I fell for her Charm as well!UGH there is so much I can say about this book but I can't right a ten page report on Amazon so I will just tell you that you MUST 'One Click' this and any other book in the Dragon Guard Series and start reading today!5 *WINK* READBook Flirts by Jessi

$review_text.: I have been a great fan of Robert Moss's books and workshops for over 15 years, since I first stumbled upon &#34;Conscious Dreaming&#34;

 He is a lively and very inspiring author, workshop (or playshop you could say) leader and the work I have done with him and fellow dreamers are life changing in a profound and really fun, yet powerful and soul changing way

 The best way to explain this, I think is to read this book

 Robert weaves his actual physical life experiences with his inner visions, quests and journeys that allows one to see and feel into his life


 It's not just a personal story though, it's so much more


It's a telling of exploration of consciousness that is easy to read and understand, but profound in all that matters to every human on this planet

Reading this book, I feel like I am waking up more and more, feeling life force and stirrings about my own path.The work Robert Moss presents as he travels all over the world is very important, but accessible to all of us

Doing the work, you must  be prepared for the gift of your bigger self!There are many techniques the author uses in his books and workshops, and it is a joy to see how he developed many of them along with his friends and loved ones.I recommend this book above so many other &#34;dreaming books&#34; by many other authors on the subject, it is full of heartfelt emotion, knowledge and guidance that can be utilized


I so appreciate Robert Moss letting us into his full life story! He's written many wonderful useful books, fiction as well, (Interesting to see how one developed for him in this book) I hope there are many more to come!

$REVIEW.: Angst, cheating (but the H does not cheat on the h - whew...right?!?), heartache, disappointment, big time romantic drama and believe it or not an HEA. Felt like I was reading a soap opera.  I was so engrossed in the story I couldn't put it down, 1 day read.  OK - the cheating issues, not cool, but try to reserve judgment until the end as this story takes plenty of twists and turns. Just when I thought the big climax had happened (and I was cringing), the story changes direction and this happens about 4 more times. At the end you may or may not be comfortable with what went down with all the main characters but ER writes one entertaining read and I'm glad I didn't miss this one. I wanted to seriously shake some sense into Gio, Bianca and Felix more than once and not sure I cared for any of them by the end,  however, Noah impressed me here - being the level headed best friend he delivered his straight forward 2 cents to Gio without judgment and seemed far more mature than his 19 years. Thanks ER - looking forward to the next installment of this series.

$REVIEW.: Natasha Whitaker is a real life private investigator. In small town Stirling Falls, the most interesting cases she manages to get her hands on nowadays are the typical cheating spouse cases. But, her P.I. skills are about to be put to the test as dead women start showing up in Stirling Falls. However, these cases look all too familiar to the long-time residents of this small, sleepy town. They're all strikingly similar to the murder of a hometown woman years ago. How much of a coincidence could it be that her husband, who was suspected, but never convicted, is back in town to sell the home they once shared?Tash, as she is referred to by those who know her well, is on the case. She was hired by her best friend's beau, Adam (and brother to the hometown dead woman) to be sure that this time his ex-brother-in-law doesn't walk free from a murder. The thing is there is no way Tash could have counted on Devin Archer being so hot. Who said murderers couldn't be unbelievably sexy? The questions Tash has to answer are, is Devin the murderer that everyone thinks he is, or a man who truly doesn't know how his wife ended up dead?Asha King is heavy on the mystery with more than a fair share of erotica, BDSM, and some good old whodunit thrown in for good measure. She pulls back the red curtain on sleepy town Stirling Falls' not so hidden guilty pleasure for those who are in the know and have the funds to pay for membership: a BDSM sex club on the edge of town. It's here where Tash tails Devin, who apparently visits often, and ultimately manages to get herself into a few sticky situations that involve the club, voyeurism, submission, and spanking. But can Tash entangle herself from Devin's sexy arms long enough to prove he isn't the killer the town thinks he is?Asha King is a new-to-me author. Initially, I kept wondering where the erotica or romance would factor into the storyline because there seemed to be a lot of suspense and mystery. But, don't fret my friends because Ms. King wove it into the story so smoothly that I had to giggle at how cleverly the romance and erotica were folded into the overall mystery theme. Tash is a gutsy heroine never showing too much fear and most of the times ready with her pistol in her purse. Devin, on the other hand, is a broody, 100% male hero that seemed to both pull at your heart strings and make you shake your head at why he didn't fight back harder against all the small-town tongue waggers who claimed he murdered his wife. Ultimately, this is one that is full of surprises but is a definite page turner for you to keep.-Reviewed by Jaye

$review_text.: Wow.  Great read.  I threw myself into this world of Spec ops, clandestine warriors and espionage.  Mr. Mayer builds the characters so well, you feel you know them.  I normally read WEB Griffin stories, yet, with Mr. Mayer's style and character development, I will certainly be searching for more of his books in the future.  The fact this author is a former Spec Op member and not only has been there done that, he really seems to do his homework.  I highly recommend this author and of course, this series (Bodyguard of Lies and Lost Girls).  Some grammatical errors found in this book (Kindle version).  He also made reference to a few things known to those who have served in 10th SFG(a).  Nice touch.  I still will give this book 5 stars.  Well worth reading.  You will be hooked.

$review_text.: "A Book is Born" is an original, thoughtful, and creative book that has been a long time in coming for writers everywhere, not just "Mom Writers." It has become so complicated and difficult to not only get a book published but to understand the publishing industry, that as a writer one often feels an inclination to just give up. This book takes the mystery out of the "science" of book publishing and puts control back into the writer's hands. After reading this book I finally understand what publishers are looking for and how to achieve that standard, if it's something I choose to do.Author Nancy Cleary is a pioneer and a visionary who not only provides wonderful insight into the publishing industry, but who has raised the gold standard in women's writing by establishing a coop of writers who just happen to be mothers. It is difficult enough to get a book published these days, but try to get a book on motherhood published, especially when it is written by a mother, and it is even more difficult. Through her own publishing company, Wyatt-MacKenzie Publishing, Inc. and the Mom Writers Publishing Cooperative that she created, Cleary has brought mom writers out into the forefront of publishing. Her foresight to bring mom writers together as a team to share their experiences and knowledge as writers is inspiring to mom writers everywhere and pioneering in its vision of moms as intelligent, capable, and thoughtful people who have a lot to give, in addition to raising the next generation.

$review_text.: There is a Dickensian style in the moral and physical squalor that permeates this book,it is however so well done that one reads on with interest and pleasure.The plot is typical MI5 British thriller with twists,turns,smoke and mirrors and the author is trapping you in one paragraph to release you in the next.It stretches a bit towards the end but the thrill is in the hunt not in the prize.The writing is post modern London vulgar but is so well done that the reader is charmed into it.The characters are mostly failures or people considered as failures in the contemporary world of MI5 whose staff are definitely not Gentlemen but do not differ much from executives in any other corporation ,with one exception : some of them put their lives on the line.The book has the necessary moral redeeming features of a good novel,and in its own hard way,it shows compassion for people who failed when they try again in spite of the odds.There is a rough optimism in its message.It is the type of novel that only a very good British writer can craft ,with very realistic if not all of them attractive characters,avoidance of a single leading hero  and basing the novel  on the interconnecting actions of the characters within the System and our contemporary Society to show that we collectively build the prisons that we find  ourselves in , and salvation  has a doubtful outcome in spite of the cost.Although it is a British spy novel,it is in the Le Carre school only as regards the complexity and morality of the plot and the fine sketching of the characters psychological portraits.Otherwise the style is not "nice" as a Le Carre novel is,that observes writing conventions of the previous era.This is a hard novel of our modern times,but it is not any less good because of itI do  not give details of the story so that you can enjoy reading it whole.It is a thriller of quality both in story structure and in literary styleDVK

The premise of the story revolves around the strife between IT and the down below, with the central character, a doctor, caught between while developing an antidote that would allow people to survive outside the silo. The story consistently follows the rules of the original Silo. This story is well written and fast paced...very enjoyable and highly recommended.

$REVIEW.: So...this author has officially ruined me for other writers. Okay, so maybe I'm kidding on that regard (once a reader, always a reader), but on a serious note, this novel is...well...I'm speechless. At first what pulled me in to the book was its cover. It is simple, yet breathtakingly beautiful. The colours just popped out at me and basically screamed for me to take an interest and attempt to read the story behind that picture. Reading the blurb, a spark was born. A spark that I wasn't sure would burst into a full on flame, until I got about a chapter in. Then it turned into a raging inferno that I couldn't put out.From the beginning, we meet the main character, Willie, and her interest and understanding of literature and poetry is apparent. But, it isn't until between chapters two and four that we begin, or at least that was my case, to care about this main character. She begins to feel real, and not just another character taking yet another class in yet another young adult novel. Her drama, her life, her passions begin to flow out on each page.Willie's pain and the people around her made me feel something. Her art, the way it is described, the way every single detail of every single situation in this book is written is absolutely exquisite. Purposeful. The rising anticipation in the relationship between her and her professor, and the absolute fall of the tragedies and heartbreak in this novel. Everything is given just the right touch to make it seem real. To make the story come to life. Throughout the story, I can sense Willie growing, I can sense her turning into the butterfly we know her to be. She goes through so much, but learns more about herself in a short time than she ever thought possible.This book is fearless and indescribably beautiful, and each character brings another element that just makes this story work almost flawlessly in its execution.A coming-of-age story that basically has surpassed the coming-of-age stories that I have read before, this book is lyrical and artistic in itself, and truly a masterpiece.

 H.M

Ward is an awesome writer and one of my favorites and it is because of this series

 I love how this story unfolded this time, it had a little more grit to it
 I will not give any spoilers but I liked Trystan A Lot in this one
 Sean was more and an ass in here but was better toward the ending

 I was so into the story and didn't realize there was only one page left
 When I was finished I yelled NO!!!  It cannot end like that!!!!  That was one hell of a cliffhanger to be left with

 So now the wait begins for 16.

$review_text.: This book had kind of a lame start,  but it was around the fourth or fifth chapter when I really couldn't put the book down. There's a bit of foreshadowing about what's going to happen at the end... which makes you keep reading!! I enjoyed the book, it helped me understand that everyone makes mistakes but learning from them is what life's journey is all about.

$REVIEW.: I absolutely love this series! I freaking love Evan...can I heart him anymore...I think not!This is Evan's StoryEvan made a decision that has been living changing. He transferred schools to be with his first love Laney, only to find out she is in love with another man....Dane. Now Evan has to figure out what he is going to do moving forward at a new school, with new people, and no football until next year. (All because he redshirted so he could transfer).To say the adjustment is easy is an understatement. Sawyer steps in and helps Evan out though as much as Sawyer helps he's still a reminder of what Evan lost...why because he's great friends with Laney...the ex-girlfriend.One night out and Evan meets a beautiful bubbly blonde girl who ends up being the enemy of ex-girlfriend/best friend, Laney. Funny how things work out. The closer that Evan becomes with said blonde...known as Whitley the more attractive he becomes to her. Unfortunately he will not pursue her because she deserves to be more than some guy's rebound girl. She deserves so much more. Whitley is there for Evan and even when he least suspects it she is there for him during a very unfortunate time.The closer they become the more jealous Laney gets. Dane...Laney's new boyfriend understands that Laney loves Evan even though it's a different type of love. He tells her to make things right with Evan because he knows how upset she is with losing her best friend.When Laney tries to fix her friendship with Evan she has to endure seeing Whitley when the crew hang's out. The more Laney gets to know Whitley she is able to see a good person, not this person she disliked for really no reason at all.When Evan decides to start dating things turn for him. He goes on date after disastrous date his new found friend is there to help him out of bad situations.But when Evan realizes his true happily ever after has been in front of him this entire time will it be too late? While Whitley still be around once Evan realizes she's the one or will she have moved on with her own life and relationships?This was a great story and I absolutely loved the ending! I am definitely looking forward to more of Sawyer's story!!! That badass boy can be tamed, I just know it!

$REVIEW.: This is book 4 in the Distinguished Rogues series, but has characters from Hunting the Hero as the H/H and secondary characters.Arabella Lawson, Lady Farnsworth, has come to London to find a lover after an unfulfilled marriage. While chaperoning her niece during her first season, Arabella is hoping to find a kind lover to rid her of her innocence. Unfortunately, her unruly niece has kept her on her toes and hasn't left much time for search for that perfect person.On one of her many searches for her wayward niece, Arabella falls into one of Lord Rothwell's assignations. Merrick Bishop, the Earl of Rothwell, can't believe that he has Lady Farnsworth in his arms. What must she think of him now?Arabella's brother in law is going to force her to remarry. With no family of her own, she turns to Merrick for help.  Merrick can't believe his luck. As his friendship with Arabella grows, so do the secret feelings he has felt for her.  Can he convience Arabella to take a second chance at marriage?I really enjoyed this story.  Merrick is suppose to have such a bad reputation, but the fact that he has taken in all of his father's illegitimate children and given them jobs shows that there is much more to the man than we first thought. He also thought so much of Arabella, that he didn't push her in anyway towards something intimate.  Although at times, I just wanted to tell him to go for it!This is my first book by this author and I will definitely be back for more.Thanks go to LLD Press via NetGalley for a copy of the book in exchange of and honest review.

$review_text.: You have to start with the first book &#34; Old Filth&#34; and read this one and continue with Last Friends&#34;.What you get is a beautiful,complex , multilayered story sort of like finding out the different sides of a relationship in real life. One always knows only one side of a story in real life and then sometimes, you hear another point of view from someone involved in the story and it just explains things you couldn't figure out....that is part of the deep satisfaction and intense engagement I felt with all the three books. I highly recommend them!

$review_text.: Three sisters separated for years on the planet Drako with no knowledge of the others or their parentage; an imprisoned father who was King; and a mother who loved them enough to give them up for eleven years - telepathic wolves continue to instruct and fight shoulder to shoulder with humans in this second book of the Heirs to the Throne series. Diane Rapp's research is flawless even in small matters such as archery and the flight of an arrow. The villain is too evil and the young lovers too naive and too quick to express their love, but the burly soldier Trenton, the old doctor Alexander, the women who fight like Samurai, the girl who mind melds with her wild animals, Krystal the loving mother, Maggie the good wife and consummate cook, the telepathic wolves of Drako, a young dragon with iridescent wings, and a host of other well rounded personalities make this book a fascinating read with a rather slow beginning. I was asked to give an honest review of the Havenshire Resistance and the third book Dragon Defense, but will certainly read the first book (Howl of the Wolf) in the series as well. The Havenshire Resistance stands on its own as an excellent read but I would recommend reading the entire series in order. I wish I had read the first book before tackling the second, though a synopsis of the preceding tale is given by the author. Overall, this is an exciting, authentic, intriguing and adult novel well written by Diane Rapp. I look forward to the conclusion of this interesting series.

 Jess didn't know what the hell was going on with Dylan just dropping her off in the middle of freaking no where

 At least she and her sister were starting to bond
 But Jess got to the point that she didn't know if she should trust Carter, Nick, Q, Dylan or even herself

It's something that should never be anyone's business but their own and who cares.  Other than that, a good read.  I came to realize that she isn't quite the class act she portrays on their TV show, she definitely lacked morals, but I am not judging.  The book was interesting, but she is somewhat naive in her thinking that Gene never cheats on her.  Give me a break.  I DO like their TV show, even though these two very famous people don't have the same values as I.  Worth getting from the library, not worth buying though.

$review_text.: Some evangelical Christians believe that the best way to win the world is to be like the world


Looking like the world might help us gain a hearing for the gospel.In Unfashionable: Making a Difference in the World by Being Different (Multnomah: 2009), Tullian Tchividjian demolishes the fallacy of such thinking
Instead, Tullian skillfully shows how we as Christians make the biggest difference in the world when we are most different from the world.The power behind our proclamation of the gospel comes not from our being in step with the world, but from our being out of step with the surrounding culture
Once you sacrifice the counter-cultural nature of the gospel in order to be "cool" in the present, you abandon the greatest opportunity you have to make a difference that will last forever.Unfashionable is a book of depth and breadth


Tullian doesn't leave us with superficial spiritual sayings

The book demonstrates a passion for theology
Tullian goes deep into the truth of God's Word in order to emerge with a robust, strengthened Christianity for the world we live in.But the book also contains a variety of topics


In less than 200 pages, Tullian writes about:the atonementthe purpose of Jesus' resurrectionGod's intention to renew the cosmosthe loss of Truth with a capital "T"our culture's hunger for trascendencethe importance of the church's "togethernesssex and lustgreed and theftanger and truth-tellingThis is a short, accessible book that ably covers a number of subjects
The thread that holds all of these topics together is the drum that Tullian beats page after page:"Christians make a difference in this world by being different from this world; they don't make a difference by being the same.""The more we Christians pursue worldly relevance, the more we'll render ourselves irrelevant to the world around us."Tullian believes that a biblical understanding of Christology and eschatology will lead to a view of mission that will transform the church and the world

We are called to be God's ambassadors in this world, to join him in his mission to redeem and restore the world."Since God is on a mission to transform this present world into the world to come, and since he's using his transformed people to do it, our commitment to living unfashionably has cosmic implications."Unfashionable resonates with me
Like Tullian, I want it all

I don't want to choose between the cultural mandate and evangelism


I don't want to choose between Christ's kingdom and Christ's cross
I don't want to choose between individual salvation and the connectedness of Christian community
I want it all.Unfashionable is God-centered and gospel-soaked


And yet it is immensely practical
This book displays Tullian's passion for Scripture and his heart for personal application

You will be convicted, challenged, and encouraged as you read.

$review_text.: I understand the need to restrain from using Deadly Force as an immediate response to an attack, however, the title led me to believe that the situations described would be more inclusive of SHTF scenarios. While hand-to-hand and non-lethal force defense strategies are the recommended for today, a SHTF scenario would be much less likely to present a situation that did not require deadly force. Once the rule of law has been lost, most if not all attacks will be initiated with a weapon. Well written in the terms of self defense mentality for modern society, but missed the SHTF probable scenarios.

$review_text.: An Amish Christmas is a novella compilation that was released last year, but this year it was re-released with an extra story.  I didn't have a chance to read this book last year, so I was anxious to read this book with the extra story.  I don't read a lot of Amish fiction, but there is something about Amish Christmas stories that interest me, so I was looking forward to this one.The first story in this book is A Choice to Forgive by Beth Wiseman, followed by A Miracle for Miriam by Kathleen Fuller, One Child by Barbara Cameron and the new story is Christmas Cradles by Kelly Long.  Each story is short and a fairly quick read.  There were stories I liked more than others, but overall, An Amish Christmas has that cozy Christmas feel I was wanting.  My one complaint, as is my typical complain with Amish fiction, is having to stop reading and looking up Pennsylvania Dutch words in the glossary.  I don't like how that slows me down, but I am thinking I am alone in that assessment because Amish fiction is very popular and I can't recall anyone else being irritated by that.  I always have to overlook that if I am going to enjoy an Amish story.  I like the simplicity of the Amish life and I felt that these four authors did a nice job with creating that cozy Amish feel.

$REVIEW.: This is a story that deals with the troubled lives of four individual people.First Holly finds out she was adopted. Her adoptive MUM didn't show her much affection at all. Instead she worked night and day to avoid her. Then she ended up marrying a man, who she only thought she knew. One day she got a real rude awakening, when she found out James wasn't anything like the man she'd thought she'd married.Before parting ways and finally divorcing him, he had managed to make her believe she'd never be good enough for anyone.Sofie was raised in a household with a very loving mother, but her father was an abuser. She left home as soon as she could, only things ended badly back at her childhood home and she has felt so guilty since the day it all went down. Sofie was always trying to fix her friends problems, but never managed to face her own.Dane was once married, but couldn't fulfill his wife's wishes, so he filed for a divorce. He came from a big loving family, but he left because he felt like he failed and let them all down.Charles an only child... comes from a very, very wealthy family. Charles was so in love with Anna, but one day she up and left him out of the blue. Since then instead of going back home to the family mansion...he left Oxford and moved away finishing his schooling in a small town college.For a little while these four indivduals forget their own troubled lives for a while, by sharing each other during a few wild and steamy sexual exploits. It didn't last very long, because one by one they finally started to discover what they each wanted out of life. That is except for Sofie, but even Sofie decided she'd never heal herself, unless she was willing to face her past.Would I recommend this book? Most definitely, YES!!!

If you read his stories them there is nothing I can tell you

He is just incredible
If you've never read his works, then what are you waiting for!! Don't worry if you're not a zombie fan- you don't have to be

Zombies are only part of the story


The true meaning( in my humble opinion) is the human heart and how we treat it
Humanity at it's best and worst
Hope is so powerful ,and thankfully, many people refuse to give up on it

If you never read another book you should read his stories.

Since then, we've enjoyed it ourselves but also pass it along to other friends because it makes a great gift.  The book covers everything from shells to sponges, plant life, birds and other interesting creatures you can find at the beach.  We also appreciate that the book narrows down where in Florida you can find these different things.  We've taken this book along with us in our travels to different Florida beaches.  One day, we found some blue buttons on the beach near where we live.  We had never seen them at the beach before.  The book helped us identify them.  One year, right after Thanksgiving and a family reunion, we went to the beach and saw man-of-war jellyfish everywhere on the beach.  They were everywhere and in all sizes.  They were a beautiful combination of iridescent blue, pink and purple.  We knew not to touch them but to just look at them.  We've taken this book along with us down to the Florida Keys to visit family stationed down there.  Things you see down there are very different from creatures at more northern beaches.  Down there, we were able to see and snorkel around a huge goliath grouper and several barracuda.  Another time, we got to visit Lauderdale-by-the-Sea (outside of Miami) and what a beautiful place!  Again, we had this book along with us.  In that location, you can swim out to the reef from the shore.  It's one of the few places in Florida where you can swim out without taking a boat to reach the reef.  It is still a pretty good distance from shore so anyone that's not used to swimming a long time should definitely wear a life jacket because you sure wouldn't want to get out to the area and find you don't have the strength or energy to swim back.  We had our son wear a life jacket because he was only 9 years old when we visited there.  We took turns holding his life jacket and diving down to the reef with him.  We saw eels, puffer-fish and so many neat things we don't usually get to see at northern beaches.  This book is a helpful guide we take with us for visiting different beaches.  It's so neat to be able to see different things at the beach each time.  Every visit is a great learning experience we love to share together.  This book helps us better understand the beach treasures we get to find.

$REVIEW.: Teague Elliot has his future mapped out--partnership in a prestigious law firm, politics, the Oval Office. Enter Risa Clay. What starts out with a wild night in Las Vegas that he can't remember and a gorgeous redhead in his bed ends in one of the most romantic--and hot, can't forget hot!--stories I've read. I'm a sucker for a fairy tale, and that's what Sweet Southern Betrayal was. A gorgeous fairy tale with a flawed, sexy and honorable prince and a spunky, smart-mouthed and vulnerable heroine. I immediately fell in love with Teague and Risa, right from the beginning. I so enjoyed going along with their journey to love. But also seeing how they became whole as individuals as well as a couple. The secondary cast was amazing, and I don't have enough fingers and toes to count how many times I laughed out loud. The dialogue was snappy and fun, but also so vulnerable and touching in places. I loved it. The storyline was strong and kept me wondering what's going to happen? Something HAS to happen. And when that &#34;something&#34; did, I had a little fist pump moment at the end. LOL! It was great. Sweet Southern Betrayal is one book that will stay on my Kindle's Reread Pile. I'm already looking forward to Beck's book!

$REVIEW.: I rate this as a 4.5 Star Review. This was a quick, sweet read and I highly recommend this book. The characters were genuine and well developed.Jaynie Winchester, a charge nurse on the Pulmonary ward, is in premature labor...alone, no husband, no fiance, no boyfriend. When baby Tara is delivered, she isn't breathing and she is taken immediately to the NICU for specialized care.Terrance Zanderson, Respiratory therapist, finds himself getting more and more involved with his ex-girlfriend, Jaynie and her baby girl, often placing himself as the shift RT for the NICU. He and Jaynie cared a lot for one another but her biological clock was ticking and he did not want children so they went their separate ways, remaining friends.Then through a twist of fate Terrance makes a shocking discovery.

$review_text.: A charming rural romance set in outback Australia where two characters are drawn together in an emotional and challenging situation that sets them on a course of attraction that neither character can ignore.Down Outback Roads by Alissa Callen was an impressive read with strong characters, community spirit and a story where the character's history clashes with the present bringing to surface shock and hope for Ewan and Kree's future. Each of the characters have their own dilemma's to face but the challenges and outcome make for a great read. The way each of the characters find their path in their journey in the story is written well by the Author.Each of the characters blend well with the stories with an ending that is both a delight and pleasing to the reader.4 Stars*ARC Received from the Publisher for an honest review

$review_text.: This slender book illustrates current farming enterprises in the Upper Hudson River Valley and is organised by season.  It is both a tribute to the past, and a celebration of the present.This is a beautiful book.  It is a feast for the eyes with its reproductions of landscape painting by Elizabeth Cockey supported by Barton Cockey's text which touches on the importance of farming and shares anecdotes from those who farm the land. The book touches on the history of farming in this region and includes interesting snippets of information, such as the invention of the silo and the production of silage.  The book also provides information about some of the different farming activities in the region including dairy farms and orchards.It's a lovely perspective of a lifestyle that can be both demanding and rewarding.  But more importantly, it is a beautifully presented tribute to a region of the USA steeped in history and tradition.  I loved the paintings, and enjoyed the text.Jennifer Cameron-Smith

$REVIEW.: Well, it was fun while it lasted. In the SOUL DRINKERS OMNIBUS, which collected the first three books in this series, I was thoroughly entertained by Ben Counter's three novels about the rogue Space Marine Chapter that throws off the yoke of the Imperium in order to do what they feel is the Emperor's will. The first book thanks to the fresh idea of an Emperor-loyal but outcast Chapter, and Sarpedon and his marines were well fleshed out. There are no doubt some people that believe that Space Marines should be wooden heroes. I believe there's a happy medium between the characters being human and wooden. Thus, the adventures chronicled in the second book continued to be interesting. The Bleeding Chalice, the third volume, had its quirks, but was nonetheless an entertaining brawl with some excellent scenes.Now we have Chapter War, the fourth book of the series, and if you're like me you'll probably buy this book anyway despite the mediocre reviews. You'll want to know how Sarpedon and Eumenes and Luko and Graevus press on in the harsh WH40k universe out to get them. I won't discourage that.Just know that this book isn't really much more but "pressing forward." The storyline is sketchy at best, as it's really hard to figure out the motivation of the Soul Drinkers for heading to the planet of Vanqualis. The theme of being honor-bound to defend the emperor's ideals yet not now to the Imperium was fresh once, and now it seems blind and dogmatic. Furthermore, the title is deceptive as the actual "Chapter War" is not the main conflict for much the time. Couple this all with the fact that Counter introduces some interesting human characters and then proceeds to pointlessly kill them off, and you're left wondering why spent so much time away from the Soul Drinkers themselves. As mentioned in another review, I could care less about reading about Orks.And one last thing. One of my favorite characters in this series dies, and it does absolutely no justice to the depth and resourcefulness of his character up until then. I just don't get it: it's almost as if Counter got tired of having him around.This book is fine, really, but absolutely nothing special. It's very hard to see this series continuing, unless we can move on to another theme very soon.

$REVIEW.: "Moth To a Flame" is a five star page turner!! Hands down, this is one of the best books I have read in a while. And I read a lot of good books, but this one...this one was beyond good!! it was EXCELLENT!! Ashley, girl, you did your thang and them some!!Beautiful Raven Atkins is the spoiled daughter of a wealthy drug kingpin in Flint, Michigan. Raven has been sheltered mostly her whole life and kept away from the streets, by her overprotective father Benny Atkins. Raven is the true definition of a daddy's girl. Her and her father share a special relationship. But things soon change when Raven meets the sexy, older Mizan. Mizan is a local stick up kid who makes his money the easy way: taking from others by force. Raven loves his swagger and thinks Mizan is the best thing ever. Benny instantly dislikes Mizan and tries his hardest to keep his precious babygirl away from Mizan's clutches. Benny knows the streets and he knows a snake when he meets one. Too bad Raven's young 17 year old mind can't tell trouble when it stares her in the face. Raven soon chooses Mizan over her family and her life will change in ways she never imagined. Raven thinks life with Mizan will be "all good" but she has another thing coming. Mizan soon takes over her common sense and everything else. Love is blind, and Raven can't see the true man Mizan is until it is too late.5 star must read!!!

$review_text.: In less then 62 pages, Macus Cowper does a fantastic job going into the details and structures of the major fortresses of the Albigensian Crusade that took up most the 13th century in southern France. The short book centered itself around the castles belonging to Cathars, a heretical movement that took hold in that part of France and subject to a major crusade to wiped it out.The book comes with a decent background to the Albigensian Crusade how the castles affected the entire campaign as they withstood the crusade before finally falling.  Looking at the photos and the illustrations, it took a lot of determination by the invaders to take some of these places. The book comes superbly well illustrated with detail drawings and diagrams of some of the castles, photographs and map of their locations. The text is well written and nicely researched. The author obviously got a pretty good command of the subject and it looks like he visited the actual locations himself.The book also could serves as a nice historical travel guide as well since the author was kind enough to put in visiting hours and other such material into this book. The book come well recommended and should provide a good companiion piece to a more scholarly work on the Cathar that often come with a lot of words but little illustrations or photos.

$REVIEW.: The latest installment in the Bird Brain books takes a different approach than the previous installments. Instead of focusing on birds that can be seen in almost any neighborhood or zoo, Chand decided to make a prehistoric bird her latest protagonist.The story follows a baby Archaeopteryx as it learns to fly. Along the way, the bird accidently discovers some big inventions and befriends a caveman who ultimately sets out to help her achieve her dream of learning to fly.This story is ideal for any small child who likes prehistoric creatures. As with the others in the series, it is beautifully illustrated and teaches kids life lessons. I most enjoyed the fact that Chand included a diagram of the bird in question at the beginning and explained there were inaccuracies in the story. She also explained why she chose to deviate from the true history of the creatures. It gives a little something extra that parents, and older siblings, may also enjoy and learn from.

I personally loved the nano technology stuff in the book
It thoroughly interested me, for I'm majoring in chemical engineering, and those topics always pick my interest


The serial-killer content was also quite entertaining


I could see a  lot of the general attributes a serial killer has in his or her personality; choosing same weapon or killing routine, rationalizing the killings, being haunted with trauma because of childhood abuse or neglect

Loved the book

"Financial Sorcery: Magical Strategies to Create Real and Lasting Wealth" dives right in not only with magical advice, complete with sigils, workings and various resources, it also gives some practical advice to turning bad situations to one's advantage in a practical sense as well.I have only one complaint with this book and that it left me feeling greedy for more of the same type of advice that is missing from other books on the subject.

$REVIEW.: I selected this title because my household includes a college senior squarely in the middle of the of the 18-25 year-old demographic that Christine Whelan identifies as her target audience.In "Generation WTF", Whelan claims that her approach can change the most common (and coarsest) expansion of "WTF" to "wise, tenacious and fearless".Her proposal for taking those about to leave high school but not yet on a firm professional growth trajectory consists of several parts:-Goal setting-Time management-Money management-Relationships management (personal and professional).Whelan doesn't offer much in the way of new concepts here, and admits openly to basing much of her process on nine existing self-help guides (from Carnegie to Covey) and standard personality/goal assessment tools.Based on my own in situ examination of her target audience (in both my home and work lives), here are my bottom-line assessments of Generation WTF:(1) Those who can gain the most from this book probably won't tear themselves away from Facebook and their smart phones long enough to read it (let alone to apply the practical exercises)(2) The most focused of this generation have already solidly established their goals, and are taking the economic turmoil of the past three years in stride.Finally: "WTF" as we see it normally see it expanded in an urban dictionary context is not an Information Age acronym, even though it's been adopted as one. I definitely first heard it used while serving in the US Navy...when Jimmy Carter was the president. So it's part of the lexicon for other folks than the current generation of 18-25 year olds...

$REVIEW.: The present review is not about the book; it is about the Standard Model.The Standard Model is a patchwork; it is a collection of theories under a single name.Its best part of is the Electro-Weak synthesis, but recent experiments show that neutrinos have mass.In the original Eletro-Weak Theory, the Nobel-Prized one, neutrinos ( electron, muon and tauon) were massless.So, something had to be done to cope with the new facts.It is easy: the solar neutinos have mass, but the Electro-Weak ones do not have it !!!One kind of neutrinos is a "rotated" version of the other.If you can not detect quarks, no problem: they are confined inside the hadrons; if you try to separate themyou simply create new hadrons.Standard Model particles are said to have been experimentally found: the six quarks (never found alone) and even a Higgs-like boson, but several physicists are already speaking of a beyond Standard Model Physics.Well, it seems that there is, still, a lot of work to do to fix the present theory.Karl Popper criterium for a scientific theory requires that it must be falsefiable: the theory must predict a resultthat, if not found, would reject it.The way the Particle Physics is being done is no longer a scientific one: no matter what result is experimenatllyfound, it will not cause the rejection of the theory.

$SUMMARY.: Not even scientific

$review_text.: From the first page, I was hooked by this great story. The author has a tremendous sense of pace and the book rarely slows long enough to take a deep breath. It's a love story intertwined with a touch of the paranormal spiced with a bit of espionage. Tough to throw all of those things together but in this book, it's done seamlessly and makes for a great story.I developed a strong sense of ownership for the characters which is key to my personal enjoyment of a book.I'm glad I downloaded The Blake Curse and I hope you get the book and enjoy it as much as I have.

$REVIEW.: Just finished this book and really enjoyed it. I did figure out "who dun it" but it was still a good mystery with a lot of "action", a couple of murders and a couple of near misses(almost murders). Some other interesting scenes. There were no graphic sex scenes for which I was very thankful. It is a really enjoyable read. I recommend this to just about everyone.

$REVIEW.: Jill is a workaholic and expected to be promoted, but her bubble burst when the position was given to Ryan, the nephew of one of the partners
 Jill is forced to expand her life beyond the office if she wants to work for another law firm, but her life is pretty much consumed with work, which gets tedious to read about
 She actually ended up working with the company I figured she should work for when I read how much she liked the boss

 Unfortunately that was at the end of the book and her life did become more interesting then, in the last chapter.

I felt it would have been an easier read if she had stayed with one word.The good parts, the sex was awesome, the chemistry between merrick and nikki was electric, almost unnatural.

$REVIEW.: AMAZ-BALLS!! Flipping AMAZ-BALLS! Dani, you have out done yourself. Sexy Summers is just as good as Sexy Berkeley if not better. This book was well worth the wait. Luke and Tilly's story was just so deliciously good. I was smiling throughout most of the book and cried like a baby at other parts. I am so in love with Luke and Til because they remind me of me and my husband really. Tilly is a girl after my own heart, a cheeky smart ass with a little bit of a naughty side to her. I loved it. Luke is the male version of her and their banter back in forth is very refreshing and made my heart smile, I could just not get enough of their story. The Sexy series is so great, Dani makes it so easy to fall in love with her characters. That is what a book is supposed to do, draw you into its world and she does an excellent job accomplishing that. I feel like I know the whole Sexy Crew and I can't wait to read Claire and Oliver's story. Cheers Dani to another fabulous book and to many more to come!

The author is an amazing photographer and mostly let her pictures tell the story with only a small amount of text, including some relevant quotations from famous people.Recently I have read other books which appear to use other people's copyrighted photographs without permission. It is therefore extremely refreshing to read a book which is entirely the work of the author, with her own photographs.I look forward to reading a lot more from Deborah Carney.

$REVIEW.: This is a remarkable story that spans generations

There is a lot to be said about keeping family secrets, in this case 55 years of secrets,but it is done tastefully in this novel
Having read the prequel &#34;Sinner Man&#34;&#34; which in my opinion is a must read, one can relate to the whys, whats, whens and hows of this family situation.Julia and Melvin Cheeks showed a loyalty to each other and their family by trying to protect them from the things in Pandora's Box, and boy was that box filled! Lorraine who was Julia's best friend had her share of things in the box also
Bettye's book was full of twists, turns, and SURPRISES..
It was wonderful to see all of the characters develop the way they did

I can see this book on a movie screen, Bettye

I will stop now so I won't give anything away

Everyone should download this book and it's prequel

$REVIEW.: Judith Arnold took forever to get to the point.  I really liked the H and his sense of humor, but the h was an uptight judgemental woman who needed to learn how to do the thing called relationship.  She had no boundaries in her first relationship where her fiance wanted her to solve all his problems without giving any support in return.  The next time she becomes involved she expects the man to have everything in his life handled.  That is totally unrealistic.  Sharing the issues makes a stronger bond.  The last item with which I take issue is the mention of the classic movie It Happened One Night starring Clark Gable.  His co-star was Claudette Colbert, not Myrna Lou.

$REVIEW.: This was such a wonderful book. I fell in love with Cami and Stockton at the very beginning and knew they would make a great couple. Their relationship develops slowly and we're able to really watch them fall in love. And both are great characters. Actually, with the exception of Cami's parents and sister, all of the characters in this book are good. Stockton's sister Will is especially sweet.Cami pushes her parents too far in an attempt to try and get some kind of attention from them. They're from Beverly Hills and are too wrapped up in themselves to notice her. Their solution is to send her to her aunt and uncles in Tennessee. This turns out to be the best turn of events in her life. She meets Stockton. At first, they're snide and snappy with each other but you know it's because they are attracted to one another. When Cami becomes friends with Will, she's asks Stockton to  be nice and try to be friends. Once they begin to spend time together, these two souls, both with broken pasts, begin to heal.Great love story. Language isn't really bad and there are no love scenes for those readers who prefer more PG rated books. First in the series but also a stand alone. Both POVs and happy ending.

Connor is sexy and has an awesome sense of humor that makes it impossible not to grin like a loon while reading.  I loved this book, if you can even call it that because it was super short.  I'm not a fan of all these super short books that come in multiple installments but I have to hand it to them they offered this one for free and now I'm hooked.  So even though they are short and the next several installments are 2.99 I will continue to read because I like Connor and Lily's chemistry!

$REVIEW.: This story could not only be considered a suspense or thriller but also in some ways a coming of age story. The main character is a young man named Ethan, who ends up in over his head more than once due to curiosity or love. The mystery surrounding Captain Shelby is buried in age old stories and old wives tales, and he&#8217;d rather be left alone to fish and live his life, but sometimes childish minds will get carried away and pursue things better left buried in the sea. The story itself takes place in the small island town of Pelican Bay, South Carolina and shows a great deal of love for the sea in general as well as the Carolina coast and the mysteries it can hold. The cast of characters includes Ethan, a young writer who happens to be in love with his local librarian. Sidney, the doting and worried grandmother who&#8217;s raised Ethan from a young age. Captain Shelby, the old &#8220;sea dog&#8221; that you&#8217;re not quite sure if he&#8217;s a God, a ghost, a murderer, or an overly protective grandfatherly influence in Ethan&#8217;s life. In addition, you meet the love interest of Ethan a young girl named Morgan who&#8217;s emotionally withdrawn and her depressed and widowed father who has no love for Ethan. There are several other supporting characters in the story.I gave this book a rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars. There is one small historical inaccuracy in the initial flashback to 1931. The first thoughts that came to my mind when reading this story were that the author&#8217;s writing style and use of adjectives and vocabulary comes off as pretentious, or that he&#8217;s overused his thesaurus. The story is verbose, and that was a distraction from the story. If I hadn't promised the author a 100% honest review I would have put the story down before I got through the entirety of chapter one. I stopped reading and decided to learn more about the author, once I read the information about him available at his Amazon link, I understood a little more about his writing style. Not only does he hold an English degree, his influences came from authors in a time where the flow of poetry and prose was more descriptive than it is in most novels today. Keeping this in mind I began reading Pelican Bay again, and once I got past the &#8220;wordiness&#8221; of his novel I found the underlying story and plot line to be interesting and thought provoking. I spent a large portion of my life in South Carolina, and I could see the love he had for the coast and the sea in general. I found the mystery compelling and well thought out. The characters were intriguing, especially Captain Shelby and the research that Ethan and Morgan unearthed was riveting. Overall, the character, story and plot were exceptionally enjoyable; it was just the use of adjectives that seemed excessive. The use of descriptive writing did allow the view that the author had in his &#8220;mind&#8217;s eye&#8221; to come across in writing with little room for misunderstanding. I&#8217;ll be looking into his other stories in the future as well.

Tried to find more of the author's work in the library's ebook section but there was nothing listed


You're too talented for them not to have your books available.

$REVIEW.: This book has a interesting story line and is extremely well written
 A mystery with unpredictable twists and turns


The characters are likeable despite some human flaws and it shows how, with age, comes wisdom and confidence
 Something you have to experience to appreciate

 I would recommend this to anyone.

$REVIEW.: This book has an interesting thesis -- the study of the Bible not only made England and America prosperous and democratic, but as the Bible spread to other countries via Christian missionaries, who translated it into many languages that previously did not have organized grammars and dictionaries -- the teachings of the Bible then sparked the embrace of technology, capitalism and democracy in those countries, such as the author's homeland, India.The author believes that America must return to the morality of the Bible in order to remain great. His role models include the 17th and 18th century Puritans of England and the U.S. colonies. He appears to be conservative in his politics and fundamentalist evangelical in his reading of the Bible. He was an activist on behalf of the rural poor of India.The book is well-written and has many interesting stories about people and incidents I did not know about with regard to the history of Bible reading in Europe and America  and India and how the readership grew and changed during the Protestant Reformation. I enjoyed those stories.The author cites many interesting historical examples to support his main thesis, but I kept questioning his use of the evidence. He cites misconduct in pagan Rome as proof that lack of the Bible inevitably leads to corruption -- but in the United States it is widely known that the poorest states with the highest rates of divorce, crime, teen pregnancy, poor health care, low levels of education and racial problems are the "Bible Belt" states.He also avoids mentioning what happened when the Puritans obtained power under Oliver Cromwell in the 1650s and in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in the 17th century. The Puritans proved to be even more tyrannical than the royalist Anglicans/Episcopalians and Catholics they had overthrown or fled.The author has an extremely interesting thesis, and many interesting stories to tell, but I think he is over-simplifying the Bible's role in Western history, ignoring modern Biblical scholarship about the origins of the Bible and how it was assembled, and using only evidence that supports his thesis about how the Bible affected Europe and America. He needed to look at, address and refute evidence that didn't support his thesis to make his book more convincing.One more thing -- I was surprised that the author ignored the Eastern Orthodox church. Christianity has three branches: Catholics, Protestants, Eastern Orthodox.  The author favors the Protestant Reformation theology and history.

$REVIEW.: Based on some reviews I was hesitant to get this book but I am really glad I did. With that said I would like to note* You can only use the book properly in the Kindle Cloud Reader on the computer. It does not show the quantities in the Kindle due to left margin formatting issues!!!! Hello to the author...read the reviews of your book and please fix this!!! It has great recipes and crappy formatting!As for the recipes; I too am not vegetarian but I am an avid gardener and always on the hunt for good vegetable recipes. This book has so many great recipes in it. Every one I have made so far has been delicious. I highly recommend this book to vegetarians wanting new and exciting recipes and fellow gardeners with a surplus of veggies who need some new recipe ideas!

$REVIEW.: While I honor the author for his service to this country, he has not done a service to the history of the Western frontier during the American Civil War. The introduction claims that Quantrill's raid on Lawrence was the immediate result of  five "Southern" women being murdered by Federal soldiers, and the raid was justified as revenge for that alleged crime and because Lawrence was a valid military target. However, the author spends no time at all trying to convince us that the women who died in the collapsed prison were murdered, other than one paragraph alleging that Jayhawkers undermined the prison structure which eventually caused its collapse. I assume there is no more evidence presented because there is no evidence because that did not happen. It's a very unlikely scenario (there would be safer and more efficient ways to murder five woman) and the whole premise is very reminiscent of the ridiculous 9/11 "truther" conspiracies.Quantrill was a sociopath, a theif, and a murdered. There were many during that time (and since) that fit that description, but none who are as undeservedly celebrated as heroes as Quantrill. Despite the respect due Mr. Petersen, that fact that he is a member of the William Clarke Quantrill Historical Society should be a clue to his motives. The WCQHS regularly decorates the grave of Quantrill (really just his arm and shinbone) and the graves of legitimate Confederate dead at the Confederate Cemetery in Higginsville, Missouri. To honor a man that caused so much heartbreak to so many people, and was condemned for his actions by none other than Robert E. Lee himself, besmirches the memory of the real heroes on both sides of our nation's greatest conflict.

$REVIEW.: This story is very awkward. How can one sign a contract that requires one to either marry or pay money? This is only one of many very illogical moments. The book sounded so good, but the plot is illogical, as I have said, and the relationship is strange. Will is like no man I have ever known.  He seems to whimper and flail and simper his way through the plot, he has no feet to stand on, which makes it easy for Elijah to sweep him off his feet,but Will is not strong enough for me to enjoy seeing him yield. More, he seems more like a silly stereotype of a romance heroine than any m/m hero I have read of in the past.

$review_text.: Official Girl 2 was a highly anticipated sequel and it did NOT disappoint


I've felt almost every emotion known to man from reading this book...happy, sad, amused, pissed, angry, hurt....and that's just a few

Charmaine really succeeds in making her readers fall in love with every (well not every) character

The camaraderie they share as a blended family makes you feel as if you're in Pop-Pops backyard hanging with the crew...that's how believable the book is
There were so many twists and turns and the additions of the new characters added even more intrigue to this already banging series.It would take me forever to go through each (and not give spoilers) character...but I will say that we finally get a look into Kamil, Ramone and the brothers

Which really helped to tie all the characters in together, as well as the storyline

OG2 was filled with suspense, deception, urban love, mystery and lots of drama...and delivered in a very well written sequel that will leave your head spinning
This book was very believable and unpredictable and kept me guessing....but I was in NO WAY ready for that ending and was actually upset

I can only hope that the author has a trick up her sleeve because I just can't deal with that ending.OG2 is a book that you definitely want in your Kindle
If you have not gotten part 1, then you need to start there and follow up with part 2 because you will not be disappointed

I can't wait to see how this all unfolds in part 3


Great job and awesome book!

$REVIEW.: Stan and Jack are the last two time agents of an underfunded and soon to be terminated time-travel program in the middle of the 21st Century. Their last mission should be simple. All they need to do is pick up a candy bar accidently dropped by a previous team in the Mesozoic Era, which the common ancestor of all domestic dogs will otherwise eat and soon after die, thus preventing the evolution of all dog breeds other than Pekinese. Unfortunately, Stan and Jack are bumbling incompetents. Because of their slapstick ineptitude, Leonardo da Vinci is accidently scooped out of early 16th Century Europe and dumped outside mid 18th Century London. The effects on the timeline may be irreparable.Although the story flips between times, settings, and point-of-view characters, it is easy to follow and engaging in a &#8216;what happens next?&#8217; kind of way (although &#8216;next&#8217; is a very conditional thing when it comes to time travel). The main characters aren&#8217;t especially admirable or even likeable. For the most part, they come off as either stupid or petty. Even da Vinci and Benjamin Franklin (in England at the time) are portrayed as less than the giants of history we now imagine them to have been. What makes readers care about what happens to these characters is that the fate of the world is disturbingly in their hands.The story is a creative mix of science fiction, steampunk, alternate history, and comic adventure. The prose style and dialogue are most suited to that last of these and sets the tone of the story. The copy editing is good, with only a few apparent minor errors. The only real detractor worthy of mention is the abrupt ending. The Last of the Time Police is part one. Part two is Return of the Time Police. Both are relatively short and could have been published together as one novel.

Its been along time since I read a book in practically a day.I fell in love this book, and the whole gang right away.Lindsay just wants to fit in, and wanted to do everything on her own. But she soon found herself relying on Shane for everything. Although, he was relying on her deeply as well.Shane and his &#34;family&#34; were just wonderful characters. So different from Lindsay yet she fit right in with them instantly even though she tried to stay away from them.There were a few miscommunications, but nothing normal relationships don't have.I am ready to read more
